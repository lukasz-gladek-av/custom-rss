<p>Well, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">Lener30 on Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), there's a little more than a line of code pointing to a port this time. This time, a "Tutorial image for Local Communication" has apparently been found and (as posted by Universo Nintendo's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necro.universonintendo.com/post/3mf64ozbqes2j">Necro Felipe</a>) that sure isn't Sony or Microsoft hardware:</p>

<p>Pinches of salt and all that — and Capcom is obviously keeping quiet — but assuming it's legit, that's a smoking gun and a half. "Interestingly enough they scrubbed all the text mentions of the NSW2 Version," says Lener30.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was a big hit on Switch, of course, but if you haven't been keeping track of Monster Hunter happenings outside the realm of Nintendo systems, Wilds launched back in February 2025 and became the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history.</p>
<p>It went down well with critics, too, although not <em>quite</em> as well as 2018's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a>; the latter is sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-wilds/">"Generally Favourable"</a> 88 on Metacritic versus the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-world/">"Universal Acclaim"</a> of World's 90.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warframe-out-now-android-devices-globally-nintendo-switch-2-edition-coming-soon/</link>
            <guid>1440655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, we reported that the popular sci-fi action RPG looter-shooter <strong>Warframe</strong> would make its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-android-mobile-devices-launch-canada-first-digital-extremes/">worldwide debut on <strong>Android</strong> devices on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong></a> after arriving first in Canada. That was, of course, true at the time. But a last-minute, one-day delay pushed the release back by, well, a day. So as of today, <strong>February 19, 2026,</strong> developer <strong>Digital Extreme's</strong> game is now officially out on Android mobile devices across the globe, and it still has another platform to hit, as it'll be coming to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>This new version of Warframe almost rounds out the full suite of available platforms, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now being the last major platform that you can't find Warframe on. That said, you can play it on Nintendo Switch; there's just no dedicated Switch 2 version yet.</p>



<p>"<em>To bring the Warframe experience to Android players has been a goal for quite some time in our efforts for total accessibility</em>," added <strong>Sheldon Carter</strong>, president of Digital Extremes, in a press release. "<em>This year is set to be a huge milestone for not only Warframe players, but our developers as well. The team is elated to welcome Android players to the full foid of cross-play platforms this year, including <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 soon</strong>. Warframe has become a gravitational force for gathering some of the kindest and most welcoming communities in gaming. Thanks to them, we've built an amusement park full of rides suited for any kind of taste; there's something for everyone to discover and enjoy here. It's going to be a big year, so come join us for the ride!</em>" </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players with Android devices that are running 64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor, Android OS 12.0 or higher, with a minimum of 4GB of RAM, will be able to jump into Warframe right away. Those players who download the game ahead of <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> will also get the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong>, which includes special weapon and armour cosmetics and resource boosters as part of their welcome to the game.</p>



<p>For more on Warframe, check out our interview with the legendary MMO designer <strong>Jack Emmert</strong>, and see why he points to Warframe as<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/"> the model that all MMO developers should look to.</a></p>

He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Many modern gamepads have adopted a modular design in recent years, from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717573/turtle-beach-victrix-pro-bfg-reloaded-wireless-modular-controller">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857428/hyperkin-gamesir-x5-alteron-clamp-bluetooth-wireless-controller">Hyperkin’s clamp-on X5 Alteron</a> for the Nintendo Switch. However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282953/turtle-beach-may-have-a-better-way-to-swap-your-controllers-analog-sticks-for-more-buttons">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a></strong>, which is now on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJTJDN73/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fturtle-beach-stealth-pivot-wireless-smart-pc-gaming-controller-with-rotating-modules-black%2FJXK5HFZJF7%2Fsku%2F6606997" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).</p></div><p>The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.</p><p>As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-today"><h2>More ways to save today</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205955/lego-nintendo-super-mario-yoshi-snes-gaming-sdcc">Lego’s Mario and Yoshi set</a></strong> is currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYM2V9FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772%2F" rel="sponsored">Target</a> for a $103.99 ($26 off), matching its best price to date. The 15-inch, 1,215-piece kit looks to be a pretty faithful recreation of the 16-bit sprites used in <em>Super Mario World</em>, which, with the help of a hand crank, move to replicate Yoshi’s original running animation. It’s pretty clever, even if the 2D creation will spend most of the time on your shelf with its various mechanisms hidden from view.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds</strong>, which are a somewhat hard sell at $299, are a lot more appealing now that they’re on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbose-ultra-open-ear-true-wireless-open-earbuds-black%2FJ7C5V6T3CX%2Fsku%2F6568949%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $199.99. The unique open-style earbuds leverage the company’s OpenAudio technology to direct sound toward your ears while keeping your canals unobstructed, allowing them to deftly blend music with your daily life. They’re extremely comfortable and easy to control, too, though the trade-off for total awareness means you’re going to be giving up some of that low-end oomph in the process. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073019/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>If you’re a Pixel phone owner who prioritizes their phone above all else, <strong>Google’s Pixel Flex Fast Charger</strong> is now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGNHN2HX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-flex-dual-port-67-w-usb-c-wall-charger%2F" rel="sponsored">Verizon</a> for $35.99 ($24 off), its lowest price to date.

              <p><span>Sony and Santa Monica Studio announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><span>remake of the original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span> during the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span> last week, and details about the project are still pretty scarce. However, we may have gotten some information from an unlikely source: Christopher Judge, the voice of Kratos. No, not the one who was in the State of Play talking about the remakes, the one who plays the god of war in the series’ more recent, Norse-themed games.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Fuzhpuzy posted </span><a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"><span>a since-deleted video</span></a><span> from Fan Expo Vancouver 2026 in which she approached Judge and asked him a few questions about the upcoming remakes in which, the actor confirmed, he will not be playing Kratos, as original Kratos voice actor T.C. Carson is reprising his role.</span></p>

 <p><span>Judge confirming he won’t be playing Kratos is one thing, but it seems the actor is still privy to some unannounced details about the remake project. He said that the games will include a new “fighting system.” Could this mean that the remakes are leaning into modern </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s heavier combat systems rather than going back to the hack-and-slash mechanics of old? Judge didn’t get any more specific, so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ps5-remake-trilogy-sex-minigames-censored-2000669769"><span>we can only speculate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The big reveal here, however, is that Judge says we’ll hear about what he is doing with Santa Monica Studio “late summer,” though he doesn’t say if this is a new </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> game or an unrelated project.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Fuzhpuzy has taken down the video, it has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596"><span>shared on social media</span></a><span>. Hopefully Judge doesn’t get into too much trouble over this. Last year, Ubisoft apparently threatened </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>actor Matt Ryan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-remaster-matt-ryan-1851787469"><span>with legal action</span></a><span> for discussing the still-unannounced </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag </span></i><span>remake with a fan at a convention.</span></p>

<p>More layoffs have hit the gaming industry.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft has laid off 40 employees at its Toronto studio. The job cuts are reportedly part of larger cost-saving initiatives. Other parts of these initiatives have included the closure of Ubisoft Halifax, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">cancellation of multiple projects</a>, and other major restructuring measures.</p>



<p>“This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected,” Ubisoft said in a statement before confirming that they would help support these employees through their transition.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also confirmed that the company is still working on the remake of the original Splinter Cell game. The remake was announced in 2021, and no gameplay footage has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ubisoft is not the only company facing major changes and cuts in 2026. Wildlight Entertainment, makers of Highguard, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" id="176078">announced mass layoffs</a> less than a month after that game launched.</p>



<p>Riot Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized the team</a> developing the 2XKO fighting game. Moonshot Games, the developer of Wildgate, also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">confirmed several layoffs.</a> GTFO developer 10 Chambers was also hit with a significant restructuring, recently<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-confirms-mass-layoffs-in-major-restructuring/" id="176851"> confirming a large number of layoffs.</a></p>







<p>The layoffs are not only exclusive to the game development side of the industry. Clickout Media, owner of sites such as The Escapist and Esports Insider, is undergoing mass layoffs amid a pivot to AI-generated content.

<figure data-uuid="ac56ce1c8a42f"><a title="EA Sports FC 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac56ce1c8a42f/ea-sports-fc-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t9y1">Match of the Day</a> commentator Guy Mowbray has been a staple voice in various football (soccer) games over the years. Having worked on the iconic BBC show for over 20 years, he's become one of the defining voices of the sport for a thousands.</p>
<p>But commentating real football game on live TV is <em>very</em> different to supplying voice lines for a video game franchise like <strong>EA Sports FC</strong>, and in a report from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC Sport</a>, it's been revealed that EA uses an AI replica of Mowbray's voice to do some of the work. With Mowbray's permission, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r2Zh6lJRTak" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr2Zh6lJRTak" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed62bd51gjnpvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In the piece, Mowbray — whose first video game commentary can be heard on the UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002 on PS2 — admits that doing voiceover for EA nowadays is a "never-ending job" as it "constantly needs updating" with new names joining the beautiful game constantly alongside additional game modes and new terms.</p>
<p>"Either recording or doing prep, it is part of my weekly routine - pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July", Mowbray says, meaning it takes up a huge chunk of the football season in the UK.</p>
<p>It's not just that Mowbray has to say hundreds of footballer names, however, more that he has to say each of them multiple different times in different styles, pitches, or tones, depending on where they might be on the pitch and what they're doing. With over 20,000 players in the FC, that's a huge ask. Which is where AI comes in, at least to help with some of the player names.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of our development pipeline - from animation to gameplay systems - and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences," EA tells the BBC, reiterating that the human touch is necessary for the experience: "...when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."</p>

<p>Mowbray collaborates with EA on this, and advised that the commentary "has got to be at different levels depending where he is on the pitch, as I would do when commentating normally."</p>
<p>"It can't be scripted for me because it has got to be in my style and how I would say it in real life, so I have to think of those lines myself. It's the same for Sue [Smith] on co-comms — she will need 10 different ways of adding insight or colour too."</p>
<p>So it's a very in-depth process, but it's not clear whether EA uses AI for commentators other than Mowbray. We've reached out to EA for clarification on this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of concerns about AI use around actors and voice actors in particular, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/bayonetta-star-jennifer-hale-on-the-sag-aftra-strikes-ai-is-coming-for-us-all">Mass Effect star Jennifer Hale speaking out about the issue back in 2024</a>, and a number of strikes held by voice acting unions over the years.</p>

			<p>For a good while now, the gaming industry has been grappling with the controversial integration of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> in game development, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more and more studios and publishers</strong></a> implementing it in a variety of ways.

<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong> likened the development process to that of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"craftsman,"</strong> arguing that the human touch is what ultimately makes a project special.

<p>According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda’s</em></strong> current interest in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">AI</strong> lies in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"big data"</strong> tasks, letting it handle the back-end busywork that traditionally takes a lot of time for actual developers to complete.

            <title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 Is In Real Trouble After More Big Delays And Promises]]></title>

            <guid>1440601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s mid-expansion update<em> Shadow and Order</em> has been delayed by three months after weeks of silence leading up to its originally planned March 3 launch. Bungie blames the wait on “large revisions” to address months of player complaints but it puts the loot shooter in an even worse position after an already terrible year.</p> <p><em>Destiny 2</em> players are the fans who cried wolf. They’re always sounding the alarm even when things are going relatively well. But trust me when I say things have never been this bleak in the history of the soon-to-be 12-year-old sci-fi MMO. Its concurrent PC player count is at an all-time low. Last December’s <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion was a neat story campaign but did little to fundamentally patch up the broader game’s crumbling framework. And a long-promised roadmap of the game’s future has been MIA for months.</p>

 <p>Normally, a message from Bungie going, “Hey, we get it, we’re working on fixing things, it’s just going to take some extra time” would be the kind of thing that soothes some of the panic. Instead, <em>Shadow and Order</em>‘s February 18 delay announcement has only made everyone even more worried. “Our next Major Update, <em>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order</em>, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed,” it read. “This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. </p> <p>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We…</p> <p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2024242522004836464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Bungie continued, “This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April).”</p>

 <p>This will be Greek to most folks, including any lapsed <em>Destiny 2</em> fans that have been out of the loop for the last year, but it essentially suggests the studio is trying to overhaul some of the main loot chase complaints players have had since the current Year of Prophecy launched last July. We don’t get a clear idea of how that progression will be fixed, however, or a sense that Bungie itself knows yet.</p>

 <p>The normal thing for Bungie to do right now would be a developer diary that lays out the team’s evolving design philosophy and explains what the next three months will be spent fixing. Instead, the announcement reads like a grudging, last-minute “the dog ate my homework” acknowledgement following weeks of fans begging for an update. Bungie actually deleted a weekly reset post recently because so many fans were dunking on it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cannot apologize enough for the delay here. Team's still jamming. Hope to have some comms out soon.</p> <p>Please continue to yell at me directly, and I say this without any sarcasm.</p> <p>They're focused on our immediate and long term future.</p> <p>I am happy to take 100% of the blame here in…</p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1985744704886227117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some have wondered if Bungie is essentially trying to shift the spotlight from <em>Destiny 2</em>, its troubled but already long-established multiplayer hit, to the upcoming launch of <em>Marathon</em>, its first new shooter in over a decade. This way, the bad vibes surrounding the former don’t start contaminating the glowing potential of the latter. Maybe Bungie even hopes more <em>Destiny 2</em> players will give <em>Marathon</em> a shot now that they have nothing new to play for the next three months.</p>

 <p>Maybe, possibly, who knows? Either way, that only buys<em> Destiny 2</em> a little more time before it has to come out and impress players with&nbsp;<em>something</em>. June would normally be the time frame for fans to get excited for the next annual expansion rather than dreading a potential “too little, too late” approach to last year’s leftovers. The fact that the game’s current existential crisis has some players once again wishing for <em>Destiny 3</em> while others go back and re-grind through <em>Destiny 1</em>&nbsp;tells you how cooked things are right now.</p> <p>It doesn’t feel like there’s enough gas left in the tank to reignite the engine, and Bungie not coming out and confidently saying there is only adds to the doomerism.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There aren’t many games out there with a more horrifying story than Poppy Playtime: orphans taken in only to be experimented on and converted into horrifying, life-sized toys. It’s enough to make anyone’s skin crawl, but there’s one that stands out from the rest—the Prototype.</p>



<p>Forget Huggy Wuggy and his grizzly smile, or Catnap’s hauntingly vacant eyes, it’s the Prototype that’s the real monstrosity. Although he’s long been teased throughout the previous chapters, he’s finally had his big reveal in Chapter 5, and it was well worth the wait. </p>







<p>But it wasn’t just his appearance that was shown off, as some significant lore was dropped, and it’s something every fan needs to know. If you’re interested, read on, but be warned! There are plenty of spoilers ahead for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-prototype-look-like-in-poppy-playtime">What Does The Prototype Look Like In Poppy Playtime?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sorry Huggy! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, the Prototype has finally been revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, and he’s as monstrous as you could ever imagine. </strong></p>



<p>The Prototype is a towering mechanical-organic monstrosity with a cracked porcelain jester face locked in a wide grin. Its thin torso reveals a faintly glowing core, while long skeletal arms end in sharp, needled fingers. Below the waist, its body fuses into a spider-like machine built from factory scrap, giving it multiple jointed metal legs and an unsettling, towering presence.</p>

</ul>



<p>What makes the creature especially disturbing is how it upgrades itself by scavenging the remains of other toys. Embedded into its frame are salvaged parts like the arms of Mommy Long Legs, Kissy Missy, and Huggy Wuggy, along with a purple fur hide, red gas canisters, and the emitter taken from CatNap.</p>







<p>All in all, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Prototype is a menacing villain, but it’s the creature’s origin that’s somehow even more haunting…</p>

<figure><figcaption>Don’t hold her too tight, she might crack… Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 that the Prototype is actually Experiment 1006, with the human identity of Oliver Ludwig, son of Elliot Ludwig and (likely adopted) brother to Poppy Ludwig, who was the inspiration for the Poppy Playtime dolls.</strong></p>



<p>It would explain why the Prototype is seemingly protective of Poppy, and he even appears confused and distraught when he cracks her porcelain head at Lily Longbraids’ tea party, as if it were an accident. </p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, there’s still confusion surrounding what the Prototype wants, but it could explain why they presented themselves to the protagonist as a child named Ollie in Chapter 3—maybe it wasn’t entirely fake after all, and there’s still some remnant of Oliver inside the Prototype?</p>



<p>That’s for the theorists amongst you to decide, although more is bound to be unveiled in what will eventually be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 6 of Poppy Playtime</a>. Until then, there’s plenty of room to speculate—that’s most of the fun, right?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1440595</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass gets a lot of criticism, but it’s still one of the biggest and most popular subscription services in the world, particularly for games. With Resident Evil Requiem coming, getting it as part of Game Pass would be a bigger victory than that time Chris Redfield moved a boulder with his fist.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> was born on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation/" id="81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, but it has since moved to all manner of consoles and devices. You can even play Resident Evil on your phone now—what a time to be alive. Requiem is confirmed for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> launch, but it doesn’t mean it’s coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-resident-evil-requiem-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lights out on this one. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that Resident Evil Requiem will not be a day-one Xbox Game Pass addition, meaning the only way you can play the game is by purchasing it yourself.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation Plus and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers are more out of luck than Leon being locked in a room with Tyrant.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Release Date &amp; Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The Requiem Xbox store listing makes no mention of the game coming to Xbox Game Pass and any of its various tiers. There has also been no Requiem trailer or presentations where Game Pass has been brought up—nor has Capcom referenced it.</p>



<p>This means there’s no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-early-access-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access</a> and no Xbox Game Pass compatibility. For a game of this magnitude, it’s expected, to be honest. But you’re still going to buy it anyway at the end of the day!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-resident-evil-9-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Resident Evil 9 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Many recent Resident Evil games have been added to Xbox Game Pass, which means there’s a high likelihood of Resident Evil Requiem arriving in the hallowed Xbox Game Pass halls a while after its initial release.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass has included the following Resident Evil games at one point or another: Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil 2 Remake, and Resident Evil 3 Remake.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Complete Resident Evil Requiem Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This means the majority of Capcom’s recent Resident Evil games have zombies-walked their way over to Game Pass at one time or another. Logically, it means Resident Evil Requiem will also be joining its peers later on—but with no timeframe just yet.</p>



<p>It’s not a guarantee, so bear this in mind. If you are reluctant to drop 70 dollars on a new AAA title, and you have question marks about its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length and the hours</a> you’ll get out of it, it might be worth holding on for 6-12 months.</p>



<p>Head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to say if you think a Game Pass inclusion is in Requiem’s future. Plus, why not chill and talk about all things Resident Evil!</p>

As noted Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023989416042393742" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on X/Twitter yesterday: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"RE9 starting to leak 10 days away from release is actually super good for the series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a grown ass married woman, and to look at me, you wouldn't think I have five secret space hotties that live in my phone. But thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-virtual-dating-game"><u>Love and Deepspace</u></a>, I'm now a fully fledged otome game addict with a lighter wallet and a fuller heart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace is a game that doesn't just give you the chance to save the world, it lets you do it with a veritable five-aside team of boyfriends who are obsessed with you. There's something for everyone at the Love and Deepspace boy buffet: a crime lord who is also a vampire, a painter who is also a sea god, a space pilot who is also your adoptive brother – yeah, best not to look too deeply into that one. You can text with them, touch them, and you'll never argue over how they load the dishwasher. There's combat, house decorating, card games, and the potential for financial devastation thanks to the gacha mechanics. They'll even check in if your period is late. Can rubbing a virtual boyfriend through my phone screen get me pregnant? I'm willing to do the research to find out. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/crop-image-project-1-1771435408595.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Welcome to my home, House Delulu </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The seeds of my Love and Deepspace obsession were planted during Gamescom last year. In the huge crowded halls, filled with triple-A releases and mega franchises, it was this mobile game’s stand that had the largest queue day after day. My work is games, my free time is all games, so what the hell was this game with a huge booth, a huge fandom and handsome cosplayers that had passed me by? I downloaded it, then forgot about it thanks to Gamescom induced exhaustion. Cut to December last year when my Instagram algorithm decided to get Love and Deepspaced, and I jumped into the game. Suddenly wherever I was, one of the men was with me. A bit of light combat to start the day, hanging out with me while I work, checking in at night to go on a 'date' with him in between Arc Raiders sessions. I even found myself in New York in January for the Love and Deepspace second anniversary event, With Him In Deepspace, rubbing the chest of a thermal reactive cut out of one of my space boyfriends trying to make his shirt disappear. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Men of Love And Deepspace</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Meet my men</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So let me tell you about my boys. My top tier bae is Sylus. In the main storyline he's a crime lord with a pet crow and a voice so velvety I want to upholster my couch with it. In alternative storylines he's been a dragon and a vampire, so he is absolutely dark romance reader coded. Caleb is a very close number two, at first glance he's a boy next door and your *cough* adoptive brother but he's actually a space fleet colonel with Doberman protective qualities. Rayfael is a cute pouty artist, but also the god of the sea. Like, full merman fish tale style. Next up is Xavier, who is just a total soft boy, about as sexually threatening as a hamster and also a time traveller. Zayne is, well, I'm sorry Zayne girlies, a cardiac surgeon with a stick up his ass. And also a god. Crucially, while some of their storylines overlap, the boys have zero knowledge of each other, so you never have to worry about sidepiece on sidepiece violence. That, or everybody just got real cool with polyamory real fast. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/img-0628-1-1771433810754.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sylus as your vampire husband. This is fine. I'm fine. </figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Daily devotion</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It happens like this. I wake up, open up the game, and interact with one of the selections from my boy buffet - checking his heartbeat, patting his head, or asking him what I should have for breakfast. Then I work my way through my daily checklist, doing monster bounties, hunting for special materials to boost my stats, and upgrading any of the various memories I have that form the gacha part of the game. All of this is to earn me diamonds to buy new gacha chances, and to raise my Affinity with Sylus, or Caleb, or Xavier, or… you get the idea. Think of raising Affinity like a really slow burn version of getting to first base, then to second base… only it goes up to anywhere between 130 and 220 bases. I'll visit our home and work on the garden, or make him push me on a swing. Weekly I can play a cat-themed card game with him, or go to the claw machine arcade to get plushies. Some people do the New York Times Wordle every morning. I make a pretend man take a shower. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to me that you know I was, at one point, a normal woman. Your classic elder millennial gamer with a husband and with only the slightest sexual penchant for animations. Hear me out - Bambi's Dad, Garrus from Mass Effect and Astarion from Baldur's Gate. Now? I'm getting giggly and kicking my feet because an animated man calls me “Kitten” and sends me audio recordings on my phone where he moans and breathes funny. The one time I skipped a daily check-in because my house flooded, I felt genuine guilt when he noticed I’d missed our regular rendezvous. I may or may not have researched the cost of bootleg Love and Deepspace body pillows. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Secret sexy sauce</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who mainly games on PC or consoles, I was not prepared for the way Love and Deepspace just quietly works its way into your life. The top layer mechanics are obvious: fight monsters, collect memories to boost your stats, follow the branching storylines and their alternate universe threads, and build your relationships with each man by completing activities with them. Life says take the bins out, Love and Deepspace says you’re beautiful inside and out and possibly the most amazing woman to ever walk the earth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/img-1100-1-1771433710175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An entirely normal, in no way weird, ab measuring moment with Sylus</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd probably have been safe if it was just that, but there's a whole layer beneath that which has been fine-tuned to give you warm and fuzzy feelings, and make skipping a day feel like punching Glen Powell in the face when he's trying to give you flowers. It's on my phone, so a little check on the men is only a swipe away alongside Instagram and Reddit. It requires almost zero mental energy too; this isn't an AI chatbot, your interactions with the men are carefully guardrailed with dialogue options and specific types of interaction and quality time, so the only bit of imagination I have to use is the part that would make my mother cry. It can play like The Sims – that home section where you decorate a house and garden and hang out with him, watching TV or arranging flowers. Or it can be the world's sexiest Pomodoro timer, where the guys will just stare at you lovingly while you work, study, exercise or sleep. The combat has an auto mode, but it is also deceptively deep, with different systems to make sure you're equipped and leveled up in the right way for battles. There are many facets to being a woman who likes hot people complimenting them, and Love and Deepspace has perfected laser targeting most of them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The sisterhood of space boy appreciation</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the thing, it's not just me. The fandom operates on an almost religious level of devotion. There's a running joke in the community that the Wives of Sylus are richer than him, thanks to their habit of hiring billboards or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@muzililili5/video/7528026514122919173" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holding drone shows to celebrate him</a>. Recently a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTz1lwtiNf3/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">salsa advert went viral</a> because fans were pretty sure that the voice of one of the jars was provided by Sylus's English voice actor. At the fan event I met cosplayers – one in a wedding dress – and found a supportive and passionate community that is fully aware of the funnier parts of falling for a boy tamagotchi, and loves the game anyway. Online, too, there's an impressive fan-fueled industry providing homemade merch, content creators that break down the storylines and timelines, and artists who create spicy comics that offer an explicit idea of life with the LADS lads. I have, of course, researched the last one extensively. For science. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/18/crop-image-project-1771433472379.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Caleb during the sexy Star Wars-esque event, Throne of Eros</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending time with the rest of the girlfriends of my space boyfriends, I'm only more certain that I'm going to have a long term relationship with Love and Deepspace. The creators of the game are clearly very in tune with what its audience are craving – hello, vampire Sylus – and it's nailed making itself into a habit instead of just a way to kill time. Some people wake up and do Wordle, I wake up and do Sylus. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2026 I'm embracing cringe, and if playing claw machines with a pretend man is going to make surviving on the burning dumpster fire that is this planet a little easier, I refuse to be ashamed. Just don't look at my gacha spending or indeed, my search history as it relates to Sylus fan art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

It doesn't look like any other changes have been made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own the game already, digital copies of the Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — Switch 2 Edition are available to buy now separately from the eShop. Alternatively, a physical release is coming on April 16.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2024484113923571725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Originally released for Wii U back in 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X was one of the many games from Nintendo's failed former console to get a new lease of life on Switch, with additional story content and character. Now, this Switch version has made the jump forward to a further console generation, although other than a visual polish, everything else sounds similar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The year is 2054 and Earth has been destroyed," reads a blurb for the game. "A colony ship of human survivors — including your customisable main character — has narrowly escaped the devastation and crashes on the mysterious planet Mira. Trek across a massive, dangerous world and fight for humanity’s future in this sci-fi RPG. Immerse yourself in an action-packed battle system with a variety of special attacks and skills to employ, enemies of all shapes and sizes to take down and more. You can even pilot a Skell that can fly, transform into a vehicle and wield immense strength in combat – if you can prove yourself to the BLADE organisation, first."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've not played a Xenoblade Chronicles game, X is a pretty standalone entry into Monolith Soft's RPG series — and also pretty well received. "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">review of the game's Switch port</a>, awarding it 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Xenoblade Chronicles X, like many games, was a good game stuck on the poorly selling Wii U. Last March, it was freed from those confines and ported to the Switch, but since it was only a few months before the launch of the Switch 2, some felt rightfully frustrated that it didn't get the performance boost from the newest console. Today, however, Nintendo not only announced that very upgrade, but you don't have to wait – it's out right now.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC0XfI25wro"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC0XfI25wro" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The paid upgrade costs $4.99, and if you don't have a copy of the game yet, you can buy a Switch 2 version for $64.99, an appropriate $5 more than the Switch 1 release. This enhanced version of the game supports a 4K resolution when docked and "smoother framerates" that the above trailer says can go "up to 60 fps," which implies that actual fps values will vary in-game.</p><p>The Xenoblade Chronicles games are a series of RPGs defined by their real-time combat, sci-fi fantasy setting, and massive open worlds. Xenoblade Chronicles X distinguishes itself from the series' other games due to its mechs, which players can use to fight and fly around the world. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_x/b/wii_u/archive/2015/12/04/game-informer-review-xenoblade-chronicles-x.aspx">We gave the original a 7.25</a>, saying, "Players with great patience for grinding are rewarded with intriguing places to discover and creatures to fight, but for me, only a handful of the 100 hours I spent wandering Mira felt like a true adventure."</p><p>For more Xenoblade, check out our reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/xenoblade_chronicles_2/b/switch/archive/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review-game-informer.aspx">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3/a-dull-knife">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/a-paid-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-2-upgrade-is-available-now]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're excited for Resident Evil: Requiem, you may want to stay clear of social media for a while, as leaks about the game's ending are popping up online.</p>
<p>Capcom is trying to curb the problem, taking down early spoilers for the survival horror release, but it's proving to be a struggle. On the Resident Evil Requiem Reddit, posts about the leak are being shared and discussed widely. This includes full story breakdowns, specific conversations around certain characters, and gameplay discussion. Steer clear!</p>
<p>This comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-early-copies-of-resident-evil-requiem-appear-in-the-wild-fans-warn-that-now-is-the-time-to-log-off-in-order-to-avoid-leaks">physical versions of the game were obtained early by some members of the public</a> earlier this week. The moment this happened, the clock started ticking towards a wave of unfettered story details spreading across the internet. Almost like some kind of virus. Umbrella would be proud.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, a continuation of the main-line story and Leon Kennedy's arc through the legendary horror franchise, sees him return to Racoon City to uncover some mystery still lurking in that ruined city. Grace, a new character to the series, also plays a key role as the game's second protagonist. All this was known about already from trailers and official releases. Take that and hide away from anything else!</p><p>If you want to get an idea of what the game is like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer previewed it earlier this year</a>. In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the 27th February, to the PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle Vision Network Preview – The culmination of Capybara’s puzzling craft]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/19/battle-vision-network-preview-the-culmination-of-capybaras-puzzling-craft/</link>
            <guid>1440550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Any conversation about the best indie developers must include Capybara Games. With a catalogue that stems from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/might-magic-clash-of-heroes">Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes</a>, through Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, to Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked, they consistently turn out the kind of games that stay with you long after you’ve finished playing. Battle Vision Network is set to be their latest, continuing in the vein of previous puzzle-infused games like Clash of Heroes, Critter Crunch, and Grindstone, and just like everything that’s gone before, it looks like it’s going to sink its way into your synapses and have you playing out moves while you’re trying to drift off to sleep.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battle Vision Network – Official Trailer | Capybara Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lr18stnLCrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is a tactical puzzle Roguelike battler, with teams competing in an intergalactic contest for glory. Dan Vader, Capy’s Creative Director tells us, “A Roguelike run of the game is framed as a season of this sport, and of this spectacle that is the BVN show.” He continues, “At the start of the game there’s only one team available, but as you progress you unlock more teams and more captains, each with their own playstyle and abilities.”</p>


<p>You can see that play out in the gameplay trailer, where a piece of toast shaped like a cowboy faces off against a skeleton in a rainbow cape – that’s Texas Toast vs. Rainbow Sparkle, obviously. It’s not just extremely bright and vibrant, but there’s the same sense of humour and quirky art direction that made Grindstone so memorable.</p>
<p>Dan tells us that Battle Vision Network is a spiritual successor to Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes, and anyone who’s played that classic title will be able to see the same gameplay threads running through BVN, with two teams made up of different units facing off in turn-based combat.</p>


<p>Different units have unique abilities and uses, such as Todd Thumb. This little finger fella can be stacked into a row of three, which sends a large thumb-based attack straight at the opposition. As you progress through a run, you draft more and more units into your team, until you’ve got a full roster, with a host of different abilities that will give you a variety of tactical options to choose from.</p>
<p>As you complete rounds, you’ll earn Bucks, which you can spend on upgrades for your team, or to upgrade specific units. You’ll also gain a Penant Flag through each round, choosing between three enhancements for your team, and leaning into that Roguelike structure and the random factor that can turn a mediocre run into a mammoth success.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network began life as a mobile-first, PvP, season-based concept, and Capybara were originally working with Netflix to bring it to their mobile game library. However, in 2024, it became clear that Battle Vision Network wasn’t fitting into Netflix’s overarching plan, and Capy were thankfully able to reassess and rework the game, altering how players progress, shifting the focus to a single-player campaign, more like Grindstone and Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes.</p>

<p>Dan honed in on some of the key changes when coming from a mobile title, saying, “OK, we’re going to make a PC widescreen game, and we know that kind of audience soaks up complexity and depth, and experimentation and optimisation, and we can lean into that. And for us, we’re getting older, I have a family, I have a very demanding job, I don’t get to play as many 100-hour RPGs as I used to, so it’s emerged over the years that I really love run-based games, because they’re bite-sized. I can pick them up, I can play a little bit, have a little run, or pause a run, and I don’t feel that I haven’t made a dent in the game. So, we were really enthusiastic to explore our mechanics in that format that we were loving, anyway.”</p>
<p>One of the main differences over Clash of Heroes is that your Captain isn’t just an icon in the corner of the screen, they’re a physical unit with their own abilities, effects and place on the board. They can make the difference between failure and success, but you’ll need to know when and how to utilise them to maximise their impact.</p>

<p>Beyond the gameplay, fans of previous Capybara Games will be delighted to learn that the soundtrack is a collaboration between two of their previous composers: Jim Guthrie, who penned the soundtrack for Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP and Below, and Sam Webster, who wrote the soundtrack for Grindstone. BVN could well be amongst the best-sounding games of 2026, just on that legacy alone.</p>
<p>Battle Vision Network is set to launch initially on PC and the team are targeting being Steam Deck Verified, which seems like the perfect way to experience the puzzling action. As a huge fan of their previous games, BVN has dropped its way straight into my most-wanted list.</p>

<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162117/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Published by Ysbryd Games and developed by brlka, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> is an arduous platformer presented primarily in a retro 4:3 aspect ratio. It follows a teenage girl named Maya as she wends her way through a lonesome, though artfully-depicted, castle and the surreal, twisted memories that haunt it.</p>
<p>The game begins as many platformers do: through a series of progressively more challenging areas, I’m introduced to our white-haired protagonist’s limited, yet effective, skill set. Maya is able to jump and high jump, but her main ability flips gravity, sending her feet-first towards the top of the screen. The obstacles in the early areas are the expected spiked surfaces, moving platforms, and simple puzzles amid a variety of dark, unusual stages.</p>
<p>While the art as a whole is one of Love Eternal’s more tantalising draws, I was particularly taken by the hand-painted backdrops for each level. They suggest an expansiveness that would be difficult to achieve with the shape of each screen alone, while the thinly etched netting visibly draped over suburban neighbourhoods and palm trees hints at a larger picture of Maya’s prison.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162120/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Flipping gravity certainly isn't a unique inclusion for a platformer (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> is one example), but Love Eternal makes it the focus of gameplay to an engaging degree. Once Maya 'flips', she can’t do so again until she’s landed on a surface. Sometimes there are red orbs that recharge the ability if you touch them mid-air, which make a satisfying glass-shattering sound when struck.</p>
<p>Many levels require you to navigate through a maze of deadly impediments, all without ever touching the ground. Recharging the gravity flip is what makes this possible, with the red orbs acting almost as bouncing points that guide the way. But flipping isn't instantaneous. If you're barreling towards a spiked surface and flips too late, your residual momentum will smash Maya against the ceiling with a crackling gasp. It requires an almost mathematical eye towards timing and acceleration that nonetheless begins to become instinctual after a fashion.</p>

<p>A subtly unsettling score underlines your explorations throughout the castle--a welcoming softness in the contrast to the sharper sound effects of so many deaths. And make no mistake, you will die. A lot.</p>
<p>The game's difficulty embodies the traditional rhythm of platformers. As soon as I'd painstakingly mastered every minor motion and each instant of precise timing in one realm, I finally escaped the prison I started to loathe and am unleashed upon a new level that I'll have to learn a fresh sequence of tediously ordered movements to defeat. For those who love punishing platform mechanics, this is probably a boon. Those who only grind through high difficulty gameplay to unearth satisfying story elements might have a more mixed experience.</p>
<p>Love Eternal bills itself as a psychological horror. It seems to deliver on this promise in the first half, but the tone segues into strange humour and meta-narrative in the latter part of the game. Beware: there are some story spoilers ahead. The set-up is brief but chilling. Maya begrudgingly sits down to dinner with her family before being asked to go answer the phone. She follows the ringing into the hallway, and picks up the phone only to find silence on the other end. When she returns to the dining room, everyone is gone from the table and the front door is open. Walking outside is when the game starts in earnest, as Maya finds her home is just one of many ruins amidst an eerie landscape.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162119/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As Maya navigates the labyrinthine environment, she stumbles upon bizarre versions of her life and family members. Soon, she begins to uncover memories of others who were trapped like herself, and eventually she is confronted by the very entity who is holding her hostage.</p>
<p>This is where both the tone and gameplay take a definitive turn. This lonely 'god' delivers a literal PowerPoint presentation featuring clip art which, while funny, still manages to be frightening. Unfortunately, the deity basically lays out her entire plan and motive for trapping people. As with horror in any format, the more the curtain is pulled back on the mystery the less scary everything becomes.</p>
<p>After a chase sequence challenge (actually one of the easier levels for me), the game format changes in a manner reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inscryption">Inscryption</a>. Suddenly, it isn't a side-scrolling platformer, but a first-person point-and-click. Maya appears to be back in her regular life, but something's obviously not quite right. She has a brother instead of a sister, and her dad isn’t the same man that’s shown earlier in the game but instead another one of the god’s trapped pets. Most notably, the begrudged god has taken on the role of Lacey—a friend referenced in earlier scenes as having bailed on plans with her.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/1621111/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sadly, the gameplay in this section leaves a lot to be desired. Your actions are generally limited to “look,” “talk,” “use,” and “move.” Each scene requires you to select these to progress, but it’s an illusion of choice. I wasn’t even allowed to pour my cereal in the wrong order by putting the milk in first. Lack of control can be horrifying, but in this case it was more boring than anything else. Despite some genuinely skin-crawling moments, I didn't find this part enjoyable to play through and it disrupted the pacing significantly.</p>
<p>While she eventually breaks her way back out into the platforming side of the game, there is another framing shift towards the meta that comes later on. Essentially, the game starts over, but a streamer is “playing” the game. She narrates gameplay, but the player maintains control of Maya’s movements.</p>
<p>The streamer is given different levels to play than the actual sequence from the beginning of the game, including the final level. I know that I must have taken longer than intended to beat it because the streamer ran out of dialogue well before I was able to get through.</p>
<figure><a title="Love Eternal Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162122/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here, I occasionally had an issue where the sound would cut in and out. Going without it highlighted for me how much I had been relying on the red gem sound effect to help time my movements. I found that restarting the game did restore the sound, but it still cut out a few more times during my playthrough.</p>
<p>The ending was more trippy than substantive, and it left me feeling like I'd missed something. There was yet another game within a game at the very end: a more old-school style action adventure. I’m sure someone will enjoy figuring out what happens if you can progress far enough within it, but by the time I got my “game over,” I was happy to leave my Love Eternal experience in its pretty grave.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The platforming elements of Love Eternal are delightfully frustrating fun with a limited set of mechanics put to creative and clean use. Multiple levels had me holding my breath, gritting my teeth, and cursing the wayward god who founded the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>The hand-drawn levels are as beautiful as their challenges are frustrating. Unfortunately, an overly ambitious narrative coupled with a strange mid-game shift mars the game's myriad charms.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-gave-arc-raiders-players-too-effective-abilities-take-down-matriarchs/</link>
            <guid>1440544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When you start your journey in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, certain ARCs, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-guide-the-most-annoying-arcs-and-how-to-deal-with-them/"><strong>Rocketeers</strong> and <strong>Bastion's</strong></a>, can send a chill down the spine of any new Raider. You'll eventually learn how to take these machines down, but there's always something bigger waiting in the wings, and in this new extraction shooter, that 'something bigger' is the <strong>Matriarchs</strong>. </p>



<p>They're the closest thing ARC Raiders has to a boss encounter. You can't take them down yourself (not without some serious luck and know-how), and they're arguably the most deadly machines you'll face as far as the game's PvE elements are concerned. But that hasn't stopped players from figuring out how to take them down, and how to do it very, very quickly, especially when an entire server is charging the six-legged giants. </p>



<p>According to <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, however, that's not how fights against Matriarchs are supposed to go. At least, not when you're still early in your in-game journey. They're meant to be tough encounters that you'll struggle with, even with mid-tier gear. But since when have players done something precisely the way game designers intended them to?</p>



<p>As Embark Studios' design director, <strong>Virgil Watkins</strong>, admits in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-admits-arc-raiders-bosses-are-dying-too-fast-because-theyre-not-intended-for-the-full-server-to-go-up-against-and-we-gave-players-too-effective-abilities/">PC Gamer</a>, working with that assumption is on the team at Embark for making players "<em>too effective</em>" in the early game with the kinds of abilities they have at their disposal.</p>



<p>"<em>Even though [Queens and Matriarchs are] huge and deadly, they're not intended for the full server to go up against and get equally rewarded. It is meant to be, you know, a couple of dedicated squads, maybe working together while also dealing with other players,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's definitely on us to an extent...I think we gave players <strong>too effective abilities to take down these things too early</strong>. So they were tuned more for what I would call mid-game gear.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, this doesn't mean you can expect a future update where Matriarchs and Queens get a huge buff. That might be part of the solution for Embark, but it's not the whole picture. The team would rather have a solution that addresses the different playstyles they're seeing from Raiders to better address the problem.</p>



<p>"<em>Do we reward the people who might pick their moment well, and go get some scraps from part of the fight and then sneak away?...Are you going to be the guy who capitalizes at the end of the fight because everyone's worn down and out of ammo, or are you the one who's trying to pull everyone together and have the fight on even terms?"</em></p>



<p>It's not just these boss encounters that Embark is looking to tweak. The <strong>Hidden Bunker</strong> and <strong>Locked Gate</strong> activities are also something the studio wants to change, because it's noticed that players will just wait by the doors, waiting for them to be opened by someone else, rather than go out and properly engage with the challenge of crossing the map to get the appropriate keys themselves.</p>



<p>"<em>When we built them, we had an idealized way we hoped people would engage. And then, you know, as players always do, they find this sort of meta throughline,</em>" Watkins said. "<em>That's where we can go look at those existing map conditions...it's about us trying to keep the spirit of those, but adjust the mechanics."</em></p>



<p>Essentially, if you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players signing on to play ARC Raiders every day, expect to see some changes to how the game operates going forward, with the game seemingly leaning towards becoming even more challenging. Hopefully, Embark is able to keep the game fun and engaging without overdoing it.</p>



<p>And if you're a player who took severe advantage of the coins duplication glitch, you can probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">expect a suspension coming your way</a> in the near future.</p>

              <p>More cuts are happening at Ubisoft. The company has confirmed layoffs at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind games like <em>Watch Dogs, Splinter Cell Blacklist,</em> and <em>Far Cry 6. </em>But don’t worry, that long-in-development-and-still-totally-happening <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake is fine, okay?</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">as first reported by <em>MobileSyrup</em>,</a> layoffs hit Ubisoft Toronto as the company continues to cut costs as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">a larger corporate restructure</a>. That process started last year following an infusion of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion from Tencent</a> that saw the company assume shared control over some of Ubisoft’s key franchises, like <em>Assassin’s Creed.&nbsp;</em>As part of this big shake-up, many Ubisoft devs have been laid off and multiple projects, including a long-in-development remake of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,</em></a> have been cancelled. 40 developers were laid off, according to Ubisoft.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-splinter-cell-being-remade-by-far-cry-6-devs-1848221698">first announced in 2021</a>, was still in active development despite the layoffs. That doesn’t really provide me with any confidence that the game will eventually ship, considering what happened to the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake earlier this year. And now it will have to be made with even fewer people to help.</p> <p>“Following the recent announcement of the final phase of Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the discontinuation of projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be reducing its workforce by 40 roles. This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected. Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance,” said Ubisoft in a statement shared with <em>Kotaku</em>.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft also confirmed with <em>Kotaku</em> that the studio will continue supporting projects such as <em>Rainbow Six</em> as a co-developer. In an internal employees-only email shared with <em>MobileSyrup</em>, the company explained that Ubisoft Toronto will remain a “key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams.”</p>

              <p>Mamma mia, there’s a new <em>Mario</em> game available to play today. But before you get too excited, you should know that the just-released<em> Hello, Mario&nbsp;</em>isn’t a 3D or 2D platformer, sports game, or other zany spin-off. Instead, it’s a small app that lets kids play around with Mario’s face until he gets tired and goes to sleep, forcing your child to do something else, like load up TikTok.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hello-mario-switch/">Nintendo released <em>Hello, Mario</em> on Android, iOS, Switch, and Switch 2</a>. It’s less of a game and more of an interactive digital kids’ toy starring everyone’s favorite hopping plumber, Mario. Or at least his face. Players can yank on different parts of Mario’s head and face to get different reactions while also stretching the famed platformer in odd-looking ways. You can also tap on different parts of his head to give him sunglasses, play peek-a-boo, or even run a comb through his moustache. It’s similar to how you could mess with Mario’s head in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, if a bit less charming.</p>

  <p>At one point, I yanked on Mario’s nose and right ear, pulling them violently in different directions, and he shouted, “Oh, yeah, Mario Time!” I didn’t realize Mario was into this kind of stuff. We learn something new about him in each game, y’know? Anyway, after about 12 minutes, Mario stopped letting me squeeze and pinch his face and went to sleep. This is a feature Nintendo says will help limit screentime for your kids. But you can just do something else on the phone or even restart the app, and he’ll be up and ready to go again.</p> <p><em>Hello, Mario </em>is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/">part of a new brand line from Nintendo called “My Mario.”</a> Here’s how Nintendo describes this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>The My Mario collection is thoughtfully designed to bring smiles to the faces of young children, their parents, and caregivers while inspiring imaginative play. Select items have been developed in collaboration with a range of licensed partners, including Fisher-Price and TOMY.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s nice, but this really just feels like Nintendo trying to turn babies into good, loyal fans of Mario as soon as possible. It reminds me of the stuff Disney and other big media companies have been doing for years now by slapping their characters on baby food, diapers, tiny toys, etc. Get them hooked on some IP before they can even say their first word. Smart business. But also kinda gross.</p>

<p>Onto hardware now, and, as will come as a surprise to nobody, the Switch 2 is still way ahead of the pack. OLED sales surged last week, pushing up over the 20,000 mark and skewing things firmly in Switch 1's favour against the PS5 when combining the SKU sales — Switch 1 pulled in 26,521, while the three PS5 models got 11,588.</p>
<p>And let's give a shoutout to the PS4, which nabbed another 25 sales this week and <em>somehow</em> managed to outsell the Xbox Series X. Hey, that's the power of Yakuza.</p>

The Chinese Room says the partnership with the publisher builds on Lyrical's "commitment to backing distinctive, high-craft projects".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The Chinese Room CEO Ed Daly says the partnership will give the studio the "confidence and support to push creatively" in order to "stand out in today's market", while Lyrical head Blake Rochkind says the developer's next game has a "strong vision" and that his company is aiming to "remove friction" from development.</p><p>Assuming this project is next in The Chinese Room's pipeline, it'll be the studio's first game since last year's poorly-received <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">spent a long time</a> in development hell before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"rescued" by the British developer</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor reception, former Chinese Room head Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggested that the game shouldn't have been released</a> under the <em>Bloodlines </em>name, which created expectations the studio was unable to meet.</p><p>Whether Pinchbeck is right or not, <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released as <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-financials-bloodlines-2-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cdaf779b-8a75-48a8-9d81-99d3be95566b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">resulted in a pretty dismal year</a> for publisher Paradox thanks to its failure. It's probably safe to say that whatever The Chinese Room's next game is, it's not <em>Bloodlines 3</em>.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room might have been the outfit behind <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but the studio is usually better-known for its contemplative narrative games (which some might refer to as "walking simulators") like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c24b924e-d035-4ba1-a306-060800f9d7e1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</em>.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether this project is more like those games than <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but for now, it looks like The Chinese Room has secured a publisher, at least. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
