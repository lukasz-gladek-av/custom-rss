            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Faire Trade</em> is the follow-up title from Sassybot, the makers of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69d4ab5d-9545-4eb0-85d7-fe27cf8ca257" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/winkeltje-little-shop-is-seriously-fun-business-that-doesnt-break-bank" rel="nofollow"><em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em></a>. Another shop manager, the game allows players to grow a farm as well as run a store. Explore all the title offers in our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d3949c9-b320-4885-b2ff-c5b74e30b0c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/faire-trade" rel="nofollow"><em>Faire Trade</em></a> preview.</p>

<h2>Early Access Jank</h2>

<p>To start, there are two modes you can select at the start of Early Access in <em>Faire Trade</em>: Sandbox and Creative. There’s no story, though the general premise is you need to keep your shop in the black. There is a narrative that will accompany the fully released game, but it’s not included right at the start.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=n7MBfgOg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=_KFhSQmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That doesn’t detract too much from the general gameplay loop, however. You have tasks to earn money, expand the shop, decorate rooms in certain ways, and hone your crafting skills. There are multiple things to level up, like your shop, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8f1b21-d841-43e3-8780-626fe2c7df99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, and farming skills, and shop appeal.</p>

<p>On top of the basic mechanics of making and selling things, you have a home you can build up, as well as a farm to expand. As your shop grows, you can hire <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d6b5181-3bca-428a-b5cc-ffaa01a33bea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-employees" rel="nofollow">employees</a> to help you with certain tasks, like restocking shelves or drawing in customers. This frees you up to handle other things in the store, like trading with merchants that drop in or crafting more items.</p>

<p>Six crafting skills are at the heart of your supply. The expected Blacksmithing is there, as well as Farming, but you also have Music, Pottery, and Swindling. Swindling may sound suspect, and it is. You can create fun things like Blessed Water or a Rain Charm. They may not work, but your customers don’t care. It adds a unique twist to the typical crafting skills found in different shop management games.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-winter-decorated-room.jpg?itok=NPNwcUcQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-winter-decorated-room.jpg?itok=T5GctYz1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are seasonal decor options as well as room recipes that enable different bonuses. These <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a5c5853d-da7f-4eb2-aa2c-c38feab20c09" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-room-recipes-guide" rel="nofollow">room recipes</a> need to be discovered, really opening the doors to experimentation in <em>Faire Trade</em>. They can grant additional storage, lessen resources needed for crafting, or increase the price of certain goods.</p>

<h2>So Much Potential</h2>

<p>There are quite a few mechanics that are not working properly in the <em>Faire Trade</em> EA version. Some events and tasks aren't tracked, product levels don't carry over from play session to play session, and decoration pieces may not have properly attributed tags. However, these are things that need small tweaks to fix that will greatly impact the uniqueness of the game and bolster the gameplay cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=J8xMW2j5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=Ajz8pwgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Different seasonal or weekly events, which impact their related quests, can dictate what you grow, craft, or buy. Though the money changes are working as intended, the actual tasks aren’t updated. This can make it difficult to keep track of the boons the events give. It also blocks other seasonal events and tasks from populating your tracker.</p>

<p>Along with the in-progress mechanics, there are a few prominent bugs that pop up in <em>Faire Trade</em>. One that occurred multiple times was when the employee's pay, and then everything bought and sold after, would stack on the right side of the screen. This wouldn’t be such a bad thing, but the total cash you have doesn’t change when this happens. You only see how much you actually have when you are looking to purchase something from a trader or at the sales counter, or when you have the profit task being tracked. Another bug is that some item descriptions will remain onscreen forever and never go away. You’ll need to exit to the main menu to have it disappear. This was far less prevalent of an issue, though.</p>

<p><em>Faire Trade</em> is a unique shop manager that builds on <em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em>. As long as you can handle some mechanics not working properly during EA, you’ll be able to experience different crafting skills, building seasonal rooms, and unlocking room recipes. I’m excited to see where the title goes as development continues.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-silent-hill-retro-camera-third-person-2000636061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-miss-old-school-camera-angles-in-horror-games.1326589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/YRtWz4NVYXA">a fun moment</a> in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</i> where, if you position the camera over Snake’s head while standing in a location from the first <i>MGS</i>, Snake will deliver the following line:</p> <blockquote><p>Ah. Overhead view. Just like old times. Now you’re talking. Overhead view. That’s more like it.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a reference, of course, to what had been the default camera style of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> for quite some time, as well as many action games from earlier eras. But where I really think this style of fixed, or at least independent, camera angles shined was in old school 3D horror games. And in recently playing two older horror titles–the first <i>Silent Hill</i> and <i>Resident Evil 0</i>–I’ve found myself quoting Snake, sharing his enthusiasm for what those classic camera angles deliver.</p> <p>The pivot in recent decades that’s seen every big-budget action game, horror or not, need to be third- or first-person started, I suspect, after <i>Resident Evil 4</i> made such a huge splash in 2005. iIt was certainly not the first game to use such a perspective, but it marked a huge, and hugely successful, departure for <i>RE </i>as a series–so successful that it may have made more fixed camera angles start to feel dated and obsolete. I think we’ve lost something in that mass transition, a special kind of experience that made for some unique cinematic moments. And nowhere is this more apparent than in horror games. Consider this early moment from <i>Silent Hill</i>:</p>

  <p>The way the camera pulls back from Harry and twists over the alleyway adds to the unnerving sense that you’re entering some kind of strange reality; there’s a sense of control that’s taken away from you as the player. Moments like this aren’t possible when the camera is tethered to a character’s back like it is in modern games; it certainly wouldn’t feel as seamless and dreamlike if a modern third-person action game just yanked the camera control away from the playerEven in describing this moment, I’m using a kind of language I rarely do when talking about in modern games: What the camera is <i>doing</i>, how it frames the <i>scene</i>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636062"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636062">© Screenshot: Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But this lack of control over the camera also adds to the horror. In replaying <i>SH</i> recently, I’ve noticed that without that control, the foggy alleyways of Silent Hill and the dark rusted spaces of the Otherworld also feel less in my control, amplifying the fear and adding a bit of directorial intention behind how a scene was framed.</p>

 <p>The original <i>Resident Evil</i> games demonstrate this well, too. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/2_dn-L9hPLM?t=5579">this scene in the first <i>RE</i></a>. As Chris descends the stairs, the camera remains at the top with a Dutch angle (a term we’d rarely use to describe an interactive scene in a modern action game). It makes the stairs feel more ominous. It conveys a feeling of descending into the unknown that wouldn’t be there without an independent camera that intentionally framed the action in a certain way.</p>

   <p>I also love how camera shifts change the sense of place in these games. Again, original <i>Resident Evil </i>games do this all the time and to great effect. Early on in <i>Resident Evil 0</i>, Rebecca encounters a massive scorpion. Standard stuff for <i>RE</i>. But first, in a cutscene, she hears it outside of the train she’s exploring. And <a href="https://youtu.be/Anm_F89z7ks?t=1497">just before you leave the room</a>, the camera shifts to a position outside the train, where we can see Rebecca through a window. The audio also shifts to place you outside of the train. You can hear the wind, the drops of rain pelting the plate glass of the window. You can’t see the monster yet, but you know it’s out there; it’s a preview of that outside space where you know the monster is lurking, waiting to pounce, and it conveys a cinematic sense of space, one that stretches beyond the location of your character.</p>   <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love a good third-person shooter with a freely rotatable camera. But there’s a cinematic language that we just don’t see as often in games anymore with the death of fixed and independent cameras. It makes me wish that in addition to first- and third-person perspectives in the upcoming <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, there’d also be a classic, cinematic style camera as well.</p>

              <p>If you’ve dabbled at all in playing the original <i>Doom</i> or <i>Doom 2</i> on PC, you’ve likely used GZDoom before: It’s one of many “source ports” of the original <i>Doom </i>engine out there. Some ports are more suited for multiplayer, others offer more modern features like jumping and freelook (heathens!), and GZDoom is arguably the most popular after 20 years of history in the <i>Doom</i> modding scene.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">OpenAI Is Pivoting To Porn</a></p> <p>A fork from the previously popular ZDoom, it was published by Christoph Oelckers, known as Graf Zahl, in 2005. Graf has a reputation in the scene as somewhat of a feather ruffler, sometimes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">described as “elitist</a>” and prone to rash actions–the latest of which was sticking some <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">ChatGPT-written code</a> into GZDoom and, well, it’s going down about as well as you might expect.</p>

 <h2>Graf Zahl on using AI-written code: ‘fuck it!’</h2> <p>Graf Zahl justified his use of AI-written code in an amusing <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">exchange on GitHub</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-fall-into-civil-war-as-devs-launch-new-engine-in-protest-at-gzdoom-creators-leadership-and-use-of-chatgpt"><i>Rock Paper Shotgun</i></a>), saying in response to someone taking issue with it:</p> <blockquote><p>everybody is using AI for boilerplate code these days those who act as unreasonable as you did here will lose out in the end and be ridiculed.</p></blockquote> <p>This silliness follows a public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">declaration on GZDoom’s Discord</a> that some folks working on the project were leaving their work on GZDoom behind to start work on a new fork, <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">UZDoom</a>, which aims to carry over all of GZDoom’s beloved features. Unsurprisingly, “conflict [with] GZDoom’s lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl” sparked the schism.</p>

 <h2>‘Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama’</h2> <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">now-locked post</a> over on r/boomershooters gives further insight into how Zahl’s actions have gone over with the community. “Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama” reads one post, speaking to the frustration over the inclusion of the code and the inevitable back and forth Internet Debates™ likely to spawn from any discussion of AI and LLMs.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njk1pxu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread documents</a>, the LLM-added code was rejected and “it’s safe to say that the only versions of the port that have this wonky code are the latest dev builds,” meaning current public releases are likely still AI-free.</p> <p>Who knows how long that’ll last, though? Might be time to consider a new source port for your favorite WADs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>An Aipom’s paw curls today. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out now, and that means that all those </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>leaked Mega Evolutions are real</span></a><span>, and fans must contend with all these new forms of their old faves. Starmie, the ethereal, possibly alien starfish Pokémon, is one of the monsters that I have loved for years, even if it didn’t quite make it on my team in most games outside of Generation I. The jewel-wearing Pokémon has had plenty of fan-made Mega Evolution concepts that lean into its inherent beauty and possible cosmic origins. Game Freak had an opportunity to make a Mega Starmie worthy of the original, and instead, we got one of the silliest, least interesting Mega Evolutions in the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Mega Starmie was one of the many </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions whose description leaked ahead of the game, and essentially it boiled down to “its limbs get longer.” Yes, Mega Starmie’s arms and legs grow, giving it more humanoid proportions, but that doesn’t sum up just how goofy this thing looks as it’s running around on two legs. I had known about Mega Starmie’s concept for months, and even I wasn’t prepared for the horror of watching a once elegant, unknowable Pokémon turn into a cunty gremlin version of Patrick Star from </span><i><span>SpongeBob SquarePants</span></i><span>. I had months to process the basic concept, but a lot of fans aren’t watching leaks in the months leading up to launch and are just now seeing this monstrosity. Many are not taking it well, or at least they’re making some good shitposts.</span></p>

            <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Truly<br>one of the creatures to have been designed <a href="https://t.co/NgzUN7CgLx">pic.twitter.com/NgzUN7CgLx</a></p> <p>— Pr Quote (@pr_quote) <a href="https://twitter.com/pr_quote/status/1978681819772944711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the Pokédex,&nbsp; Mega Starmie’s more humanlike behavior could either be an attempt to communicate with humankind or something more insidious, like trying to replace humans. Both of those thoughts are equally horrifying because if Starmie isn’t trying to supplant us, it’s saying we all run around like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon? That’s a sick burn, actually.</span></p>

 <p><span>The concept of a Starmie with longer limbs isn’t inherently the problem, as fans have been making mock-ups of the design based on the leaked description for months, and there are some cool ones out there.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>adds over 20 new Mega Evolutions, and while there are some bangers, I am a bit disappointed in the cool-to-goofy ratio. I love me a silly little guy, but a lot of these Mega Evolutions come off more like gags than anything else. At least I have Mega Raichu to look forward to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>when the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr">There was once a time when having a full-blown computer in your pocket was still a fairly novel concept, and game developers, publishers, and console-makers were all too eager to find ways to work their existing products and franchises into mobile apps. Some of these were terrible, offering cheap imitations of their big siblings and often charging exorbitant prices for microtransactions, but there were also a whole bunch that took a different approach. Around the end of the Xbox 360/PS3 generation, developers often found intuitive and genuinely helpful ways to pair mobile apps with their games. No longer did they feel like <a href="https://tenor.com/view/cash-grab-tim-robinson-tim-and-eric-i-think-you-should-leave-tim-cash-grab-gif-27711004" rel="nofollow ">cash grabs</a>--instead, they showed how mobile devices could enhance and supplement the traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">And then they started disappearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like Kinect functionality, DualShock 4 touchpad support, and motion-control spin-offs, the mobile companion app slowly went the way of the dinosaur. The catalyst for writing this piece came when I decided to load up the Battlefield Companion app. It was a great way to check statistics and fine-tune loadouts, saving time that could then be spent actually playing games like Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1. It's something I sorely miss in Battlefield 6, as taking time to change my loadout means I either need to leave matchmaking and delay the fun, or spend the first moments of a Conquest game swapping out gun parts, hoping my teammates don't hate me.</p><p dir="ltr">When Battlefield 4 released--broken as it was at launch--it even included a tablet-specific feature that let mobile players act as a commander, giving them a map-view perspective of the action while players on console and PC duked it out below. Was it an essential part of the experience? Certainly not, but it was an undeniably positive addition, and it no longer exists for little reason other than cost and resource allocation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dgZTeVnM5Sw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty did almost the exact same thing with its own companion app. Sure, there are the very popular full-fledged games Call of Duty: Mobile and Warzone Mobile (itself later sunset), but these largely scratch the same itch as the console/PC titles. A companion app doesn't try to replace the original, but instead aims to make the experience better. We all think about how we could make that one sniping loadout a little bit stronger when we're not sitting down at the keyboard. Why jot a few ideas in the Notes app when we could just swap out a gun or an attachment immediately?</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, these apps weren't just limited to competitive shooters; everything from action-adventure games to RPGs tried out their own versions during this period. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag offered an interactive map and--my favorite part--unlocked sea shanties after getting them in-game, letting you play the singalong pirate music wherever you happened to be. <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3:_Datapad" rel="nofollow ">Mass Effect 3: Datapad</a> offered the game's codex so you could read up on various plot elements while on the go, and its Galaxy At War component let you actively prepare your squad for the final mission. I have fond memories of doing this on the long bus ride to school every morning for weeks, and now it's simply not an option for new players.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most egregious example of the decline of companion apps being to games' detriment is with sports. We saw it used in a limited fashion on Madden via Xbox's SmartGlass app, but we're still in an era where the honor system has to be used when playing a local competitive football game. You have a perfectly good phone in your pocket--why we haven't made phone-based playcalling a standard feature in Madden by this point is beyond me. This option wouldn't be a gimmick, but an objectively fairer <em>and </em>more realistic way to play competitive football.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvIEmg5hFX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cvIEmg5hFX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rather than choosing from a few selected plays on screen and hoping your friend can't figure out which one you actually picked, you'd have access to your entire playbook.</p><p dir="ltr">The proliferation of smartphones might be the reason we've seen companion apps dwindle over the years, however. With the rise of cloud-gaming services, more and more titles are playable entirely on a phone. Why just check statistics or swap a loadout when you could be playing the entire game on the go? There are lots of reasons why you would still want to do this, of course, but they don't seem to be of the utmost importance to those making decisions. Services like Xbox Cloud Gaming aren't even limited to phones, either--you could be accessing a cloud-based Xbox game on a console or a smart TV while still having access to your phone! If we want games on more devices, like Microsoft seems so enthusiastic about, it will certainly do that.</p><p dir="ltr">Not every companion app has been a success, of course, so this isn't a call for every developer to find a way to shoehorn in some sort of functionality. That's what Nintendo attempted to do when the company, in its infinite wisdom, separated voice chat from game applications themselves on Nintendo Switch, instead requiring a separate connection to its Nintendo Switch Online app. It makes the experience messier, resulting in very low usage among players, which is one way to make sure younger players aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language … it just also makes sure older players also aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language.</p><p dir="ltr">It's very possible we eventually see the pendulum swing back to widespread companion-app support, provided the industry has moved past whatever its latest C-suite-directed obsession happens to be. Regardless of whether companion apps can be cool again in the age of useless AI and metaverse integration, however, they <em>deserve </em>to be cool again. Don't rob us of the simple joy of playing a sea shanty at full volume in a coffee shop to show your friends how good you are at Assassin's Creed, or of switching that under-barrel foregrip attachment for a slightly different under-barrel foregrip attachment at 2 AM after you woke up to pee. This is what gaming is all about.</p>

                <p>Whenever your Pokemon buddies are in need of healing, you can always depend on that friendly Pokemon Center nurse. These NPCs always had identical character models in mainline Pokemon RPGs, but Pokemon Legends: Z-A turns these attendants into visually distinct characters.</p><p>Pokemon Center nurses in Legends: Z-A all share the same hairstyle, featuring those iconic hair loops that recall the Nurse Joy character from the Pokemon anime series. But in Lumiose City, every attendant has a different appearance, with varying skin tones and facial features.</p><p>And these characters have their own identities as well--one side mission even has you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaDiM2S1g8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle a Pokemon Center clerk</a> named Bien (which translates to "good" or "well" in French).

The show explains the appearance of all Nurse Joys by making them all nearly identical family members.</p><p>The only core games that had Nurse Joy characters by name were Pokemon Yellow and its remakes Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, as those titles were heavily influenced by the anime.</p><p>Of course, there's a lot more to Lumiose City outside of the Pokemon Centers--you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-guides-hub/1100-6535458/" data-ref-id="1100-6535458">GameSpot's guides for Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is now out for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, the mastermind behind Dead or Alive and the modern Ninja Gaiden games, has died. He was 58 years old.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-2004-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-dies-aged-58-fans-react-to-final-message-i-am-proud-to-say-that-i-followed-my-beliefs-and-fought-to-the-end"><em>IGN</em></a>, Itagaki’s passing was confirmed by his family hours after a close friend published his final words (in Japanese) on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4120822378181849&amp;id=100007623816758&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=9ZOxenxuIRVlXwX2#">Facebook</a> page at his request, along with a final photo of the creator, posted above. The translated message reads:</p><p>Last Words<br>The light of my life is finally fading.<br>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come. I am no longer in this world.<br>(I am entrusting this final post to someone important to me.)<br>My life has been a series of battles. I kept winning.<br>I have caused a lot of trouble, too.<br>I am proud to say that I followed my beliefs and fought to the end.<br>I have no regrets.<br>However, I am filled with regret that I was unable to deliver a new work to all my fans. I am sorry.<br>That's how it is.<br>So it goes.<br>Itagaki Tomonobu</p><p>Known for his rockstar persona and outspoken, at times brash, personality, Itagaki began his career working at Tecmo in 1992. He would form the fabled Team Ninja in 1995, serving as its head until his departure in 2008. His tenure at Team Ninja is notable for his creation of the critically and commercially successful Dead or Alive fighting franchise; Itagaki directed the first four mainline entries along with its spin-off beach volleyball game. In the lead-up to the launch of Dead or Alive 3, Itagaki spoke to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/101-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3"><em>Game Informer</em> in issue 101 (pg. 49)</a> about his vision for the future of fighting games: "Fighting games need to be easier to play in order to reach a broader audience. The system isn’t the major factor, because it exists to support the games being made. Of course, developers can do more with a superior system, but it is the games that must reach out to the players."</p><p>Itagaki would then lead the creative vision for the revival of the Ninja Gaiden series, which saw the side-scrolling franchise reworked with then-state-of-the-art 3D graphics, fast-paced, violent action, and brutal difficulty. "I want to bring America the true meaning of ninja," Itagaki told us in the September 2001 issue of <em>Game Informer</em> magazine. The new series kicked off with 2004’s Ninja Gaiden, followed by its sequel, 2008’s Ninja Gaiden II, both of which Itagaki directed and produced. Both games were well-received by critics and players.</p>

<p>Following a contentious split from Tecmo, in which he sued the company for unpaid bonuses (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/26/itagaki-s-lawsuit-against-tecmo-settled.aspx">settled in 2010</a>), Itagaki <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/03/03/news-tomonobu-itagaki-announces-new-valhalla-game-studios.aspx">formed Valhalla Studios</a> to create the action game Devil’s Third, his final directorial credit. First announced in 2009, it underwent a lengthy development cycle before being released exclusively on the Wii U in 2015. Devil’s Third was critically panned, however, and Itagaki would leave Valhalla Games in 2017. In 2021, Valhalla’s parent company, Wake Up Interactive, was acquired by Tencent, with Wake Up later merging Valhalla’s staff with subsidiary Soleil, effectively shuttering the studio.</p>

<p>First up is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> which debuts at numbers 5, 7, and 8 for the Switch, PS5, and Switch 2 respectively. Combining the sales yields a total of 31,770, which puts the game just behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> at 37,502. A decent start for the sequel, then, despite some middling reviews.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> enters the ring at number 3 with 23,292 sales on PS5. This one has been getting some great reception for its multiplayer, however the single-player campaign is generally regarded as being a bit lacking by comparison.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uvqjzk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is also maintaining decent sales, adding another 20,083 to its running total.

<p>The Switch 2 has once again topped the hardware charts with another 46,942 units sold, while all three SKUs for the OG Switch combine to make a total of 23,149. Meanwhile, the combined sales for the PS5 total 14,800, resulting in a comfortable win for Nintendo's previous-gen hardware.</p>
<p>We suspect the Switch 2 sales will skyrocket next week with the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but it'll be interesting to see whether OG Switch sales also see a bit of an uptick. We reckon they'll all get a pretty solid boost.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-calls-tencent%E2%80%99s-defense-of-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-%E2%80%9Dnonsense%E2%80%9D.1326541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In November 2024, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram, an MMO that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">to practically everyone's eyes, including ours</a>, looked like a carbon-copy clone of PlayStation and Guerrilla Games' Horizon series. It was so evident that when Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">over the game and called it a "<em>slavish clone</em>,"</a> no one was surprised.</p>



<p>After making significant changes to Light of Motiram's Steam page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/">including removing certain screenshots and changing the game's description,</a> all to seemingly make it look more vague and less directly like a Horizon rip-off, Tencent fired back at Sony with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">even Guerrilla Games admitted that Horizon wasn't an original idea in the first place</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Sony has fired right back at Tencent. In a new filing first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post,</a> Sony directly calls Tencent's defence "<em>nonsense</em>," and that Tencent's continued promotion of Light of Motiram has already inflicted the damage Sony cites in its copyright suit.</p>



<p>"<em>Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued. This is nonsense. The damage is done, and it continues."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct</em>."</p>



<p>The suit goes on to claim that Tencent even tried to dodge liability "<em>by playing a shell game with its brands and entities</em>." Tencent (or more specifically Tencent Holdings), according to Sony, is the one Sony should be suing, because Tencent owns the IP to Light of Motiram, the US trademark for the game, and the official website. Tencent Holdings is also the parent of Tencent Games, so it's appropriate for Sony to go directly after Tencent Holdings, in Sony's view.</p>



<p>Tencent claimed that Sony shouldn't be suing Tencent Holdings, but Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios, the teams developing and publishing Light of Motiram. Both Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios are subsidiaries of Tencent.</p>



<p>"<em>After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities. Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram, without distinguishing between subsidiaries.</em> <em>Insofar as Tencent Holdings is in fact operating the gaming business through subsidiaries, it is controlling them. Tencent Holdings' senior management includes Ma Xiaoyi, who Tencent Holdings represents</em> <em>'is responsible for international publishing of Tencent Games.'"</em></p>



<p>For good measure, the new filing calls out once again how public response to Light of Motiram was to directly call it a Horizon knock-off, and went even further to call the game not just copyright, but trademark infringement over the red-haired protagonist that features in Light of Motiram's reveal. The character Aloy is a symbol of the PlayStation and Sony brand, the company argues, and Tencent's own red-haired "<em>lookalike</em>" was "<em>so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans noted the striking similarities between the ALOY Character Mark and Tencent's use of the Aloy lookalike, stating Tencent's lookalike 'resembles Aloy to a tee, red hair and all.'"</em></p>



<p>Sony even quoted one journalist who said, "<em>If someone told me this is a spin-off of [Horizon], I would easily believe them</em>."</p>



<p>Now, Sony wants the court to dismiss Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and go straight into the discovery phase, so Sony can begin digging through Tencent's files regarding Light of Motiram and its development, in the hopes of discovering evidence it can use to further argue that Tencent is committing copyright infringement with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>However this suit ends, it'll definitely set an interesting precedent for future copyright cases in games. We'll continue to follow it and provide updates as they come.

            <p>The lawyers in Sony and Tencent's ongoing legal fracas over alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> homework-copier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> continue to dish out the words. Letters, phrases, and sentences are being flung to and fro with reckless abandon. Sony are the latest corp to take a swing, not only calling Tencent's defense "nonsense", but accusing the Chinese conglomerate of playing shell company hide-and-seek.</p>
<p>If you need to catch up on the tale of this copyright clash, it began in July, when Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">brought about legal action</a> accusing Tencent-published post-apocalyptic open worlder Light of Motiram of being a "slavish clone" of their Horizon series. Tencent battled back, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-accuse-sony-of-trying-to-fence-off-a-well-trodden-corner-of-popular-culture-with-their-horizon-copyright-lawsuit">filing a motion to dismiss the case</a> last month. "Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property," Tencent claimed at the time. "It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fast forward to now and Sony taking a chance to respond to that defense in a court filing spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a>. "Tencent remarkably contends SIE’s claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram’s release until 2027 after SIE sued,” Sony's complaint reads. "This is nonsense. The damage is done - and it continues."</p>
<p>The delay referenced, which has seen Tencent push the Polaris Quest-developed game to the end of 2027, came alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">revamp of Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> which happened to ditch some elements accused of Horizon similarities.</p>
<p>Sony also accuse Tencent of deliberately trying to muddy the waters when it comes to who's responsible for Light of Motiram, and therefore should be the main target of the lawsuit. The suit's been aimed at Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S, and Tencent Holdings, but Tencent have previously claimed that this is a case of barking up the wrong trees in a forest of subsidiaries. In response, Sony have now accused Tencent of using their labyrinthine and multi-armed nature in an attempt to avoid taking responsibility for a game Sony claim got the thumbs up all the way up the chain.</p><p>"Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</p>
<p>"Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that ‘own[s] Aurora Studios’ — the Light of Motiram development studio," they added. "Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram — without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p>
<p>I assume that reading through this echoes how it'd feel to watch two Ancient Greek titans battle. Each entity calling upon their unspeakable mass and power which mortals can scarcely comprehend, as they grapple like sumo wrestlers amid shaking mountains and boiling seas. Guttural roars and exhalings of breath that blow away villages rain down, as the possession of the thing is decided. Both wronged in their own minds, ruthlessly fighting the side to which fate has assigned them.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's something to think about while lamenting the fact that this titanic tussle is basically two sets of very boring lawyers passing about bits of paper and counseling frowny execs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We just zoomed right on by Amazon’s final Prime member sales even of the year. We’re now in a bit of a no man’s zone before we get to Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. And yet, even though we’re in this deals desert, it’s not impossible to find an oasis of savings if you look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/">Like right now, Amazon has this Kamrui mini PC going for 19% off. It’s normally priced at $209, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for just $169</a>. That works out to a savings of $40.</p>
<p>Taking a peak under the tiny hood of this 2025 Kamrui mini PC, you’ll find a Twin Lake-N N150 four-core, four-thread processor with an integrated graphics card. Among that, you’ll also see 16GB of RAM and a full 512GB SSD for file storage. If that’s not enough for your needs, the M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD slot is expandable to up to 2TB. With these specs, you can expect a quick system startup time and fast loading of your documents and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As far as connectivity goes, the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC is equipped with a multi-functional interface that include two USB-A 3.2 ports, two USB-A 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, plus audio intake and outtake. The HDMI and DisplayPort together means you can connect to two different displays at once. It’s capable of displaying in up to 4K.</p>
<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>So the obvious appeal of a mini PC its its footprint. The Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC measures in at only 3.96 inches long and wide and 1.57 inches tall. That shakes out to only about one tenth the size of a standard desktop PC. The ultra-compact form factor means you can dedicate more of your desk to other things like your books or perhaps a second monitor.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a multimedia hub for a home theater. Sure, most TVs nowadays come with smart features, and even if yours doesn’t, streaming sticks are cheap to come by. That said, a mini PC can provide you with more versatility as its running Window. Thus, you’ll have a wider range of formats supported when playing videos locally or from a PLEX server. Heck, the mini PC itself can serve as your PLEX server if you wish.</p>
<p>Save yourself a solid $40 for a limited time when you pick up the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Staring at another low-battery warning just when you’re about to leave home is the kind of modern frustration no one needs: A reliable wall charger (with several ports) has quietly become one of those gadgets we can’t go a day without. That’s where the <em>Baseus</em> 100W USB‑C wall charger comes in, and right now it’s sitting at an all‑time low price on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">three‑port power block has dropped to just $34, down from $49.99</a>, as Amazon clears out the last of its post–Prime Day stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, and a Compact Build</h2>
<p>The <em>Baseus</em> version produces <strong>up to 100W of charging juice in the form of a single USB-C outlet</strong>, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to nearly full charge in roughly an hour and a half. It’s <strong>PD 3.0 protocol compatible</strong> meaning it speaks the same charging “language” that most current laptops, tablets, and phones speak so you get the maximum speed you can get without heating up your devices.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>its prongs are collapsible so it easily fits in a pocket or laptop sleeve</strong> and takes up very little real estate in a carry-on. It’s meant for the frequent flier or commuter who wouldn’t be interested in having some battery brick taking up valuable space on the wall or acting as luggage dead weight. And in the form of a charger for its rated capacity, it packs well – only slightly larger than your average single‑port telephone adapter.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling with having to tote up multiple chargers or are tired of lugging a laptop brick with you, the <em>Baseus</em> 100W wall charger is more than worth snapping up at this all-time low right now. Offers like this almost never stay around after the last batch goes through them, and this one hits almost all the right buttons.</p>

<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-doesn-t-end-with-the-release">Dying Light: The Beast Doesn’t End with the Release</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has stacks of content coming in a series of updates, as revealed today by Techland.</p>



<p>It begins with New Game+, Legend Levels (like the games that came before), and Nightmare Difficulty, for those who want a more tantalizing challenge in the open-world environment of Castor Woods.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there’s a PUBG Mobile collaboration (didn’t see that coming), a ray tracing update for PC, new weapon executions and animations, and visual and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of the Beast community challenge pipeline was also unveiled, with <strong>eleven weeks </strong>of challenges scheduled to run from today, October 16, to January 7. Each week, players will be able to complete a series of challenges, with special, ‘legendary’ rewards being added on weeks four, eight, and after the final week ends.</p>



<p>Techland said in a new release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the campaign, players around the world will take on weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the power of the Dying Light community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear directly in participants’ in-game stash once objectives are met. From new weapons to unique car skins, every week brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success of the community.To get the weekly rewards, players will need to contribute to the goal that week.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they began taking part in Call of the Beast!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This breathes more life into the game that some wrote off for being ‘too short’. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">In my review</a>, I put that to rest and stressed just how much meat is on the bones of this game.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to complete all the coming challenges in Dying Light: The Beast.</p>

                <p>In an open letter, EA employees have publicly criticized the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">proposed $55 billion sale to an investor consortium</a>, warning that the deal could have dire consequences for the people who make EA's games. The letter comes as EA prepares to go private under the new ownership of Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, pending regulatory approval.</p><p>"EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed," the employees posted on the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout" rel="nofollow ">United Videogame Workers union website</a>, referencing fears that EA will undergo mass layoffs as part of its plans to finance its new debt. "We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p><p>The letter also called on regulators and elected officials to heavily scrutinize the deal to ensure that jobs will be protected if it's approved. At the same time, the CWA is also preparing to organize its members if and when ownership of the company changes hands, in an effort to protect EA's employees. "As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry," the letter concluded.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">have also taken note of the buyout</a>, and they recently co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, listing their fears that Saudi Arabia's ownership might pose a "national security" risk. Over the last couple of years, the PIF has made numerous investments--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">or outright purchases</a>--in several video game companies as part of plans to diversify its economy, including stakes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabias-400-billion-wealth-fund-invests-in-ea-activision-blizzard-and-take-two/1100-6487651/">Activision Blizzard, Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/">Embracer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-5-of-nintendo/1100-6503575/">Nintendo</a>.</p><p>The country also struck a 12-year pact with the International Olympic Committee to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a>, and WWE Wrestlemania 43 will also be hosted in the country in 2027. Critics have labeled these investments as "sportswashing" designed to cover up Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">record of human rights violations</a> on the international stage.</p>

The initial release period garnered 200,000 concurrent players. Yet, the company, which both developed and published the title, has been unable to maintain that initial user base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Tokyo Game Show, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Descendant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Min Seok Joo and producer Beom-Jun Lee shared insights about the challenges of balancing a live service game, and dealing with feedback from completely opposite corners of the player base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Continuing with the example of an overpowered Descendant, in cases like this, Lee said there's usually feedback from two main groups of users. Some would argue the team needs to reduce the power, while the other would argue otherwise and ask to maintain the current status. The trick is figuring out how to deal with these two contending groups.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-capcom-designed-resident-evil-requiem-with-different-camera-angles-in-mind" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Capcom designed Resident Evil Requiem with different camera angles in mind</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“In reality, we can't downpower the Descendant, [as] that will do a very big damage to the game, because the users who do not like this will leave, so we can't do that,” he said. “So in order to meet the needs of both groups, we have to improve the power of the other Descendants. In order to improve the power of all the other Descendants, that takes more time and energy than planned.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lee added that players generally want to progress faster, and the team is constantly listening to their “needs and wants” to try and incorporate their feedback. But once they receive said feedback, they have to digest it before incorporating it, which takes additional time. All the while, the team also needs to consider the greater scheme of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Joo called this a “wave” that can push the team to unplanned directions. “All this feedback, it all comes together, and then it kind of gives us the pressure to move towards a certain direction that we hadn't intended in the beginning,” he said. “So that changes our plan, and in order to make that kind of change, we have to adjust our schedule and we have to change our priority. So I think that is the difficult part about live service games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation">Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite all of this, Joo said the team doesn't have a hard and fast rule about deciding on changes based on feedback. Sometimes it can be an idea or concern from one person, but one that could be quite meaningful. Other times, a large number of players could be demanding the same thing—even if the team didn't initially plan to make that change, these cases can make them reconsider it.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cycling-through-the-open-world-design-of-wheel-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cycling through the open-world design of Wheel World</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside looking at and digesting data, the team also leans on its intuition to decide where to put more emphasis.

            <p>You may have noticed your Conquest matches in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> have been getting shorter recently. Well, you're not imagining things! As part of an intentional tweak by Battlefield Studios, the starting ticket counter has been significantly reduced across the board for the popular game mode.</p>
<p>For those unaware or in need of a reminder, Conquest is one of Battlefield's most popular modes that's been included in every game in the series. It tasks an attacking team with capturing objectives before time or their allocated number of tickets (revives) runs out.
</p>
<p>As for why, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">an official statement posted on the Battlefield Comms X account</a> revealed a desire from the team to improve the pacing of the Conquest, as matches were hitting the time limit more than they'd like.</p>

<p>The post reads: "We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p>As a result of these changes, the standardised starting count of 1,000 tickets per team has been sliced down to a smaller figure, with each map getting its own tailored starting ticket count. For example, Siege of Cairo has been knocked down to 900 tickets, while Mirak Valley has been cut down to a stunning 700 tickets! This way, Conquest matches on these maps shouldn't drag as much as they did.</p>
<p>The response to this has been mixed however. While a portion of the community agrees this is a genuine problem, <a href="https://x.com/wiz_political/status/1978478913643802831">welcoming the change</a>, others have wondered <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1978476272327201258">why the time limit on Conquest matches wasn't increased or outright removed instead</a>. There's certainly a portion of the Battlefield playerbase keen for long big team battles, and lowering the ticket count could take away from their preferred game mode.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of quick fixes that have come to Battlefield 6 in the days following its full release. Adjustments to the movement system <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">killed a certain interaction between jumping momentum and your equipped weapon</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-issues-free-premium-battlefield-6-season-passes-to-ea-app-pre-orderers-frozen-out-of-the-game">free premium battle passes were handed out to EA App users due to launch issues</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming fixes are on the way too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">including a tweak to weapon bloom to improve aim during sustained fire</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the approaching death of "Ladder Launching"</a>. All in all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">it looks as though a lot of alterations are coming to one of the biggest Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having had a great time with the dungeon-crawling digital board gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">Demeo</a> a few years ago, a sequel was naturally high on my wishlist. That it comes with a full D&amp;D license, as opposed to featuring home brand versions of fantasy staples, just makes Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked all the more exciting.</p>
<p>OK, so the title’s a bit too much, but I can live with that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWXrLKOSmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the heart of Battlemarked is the same style of digital board game adventuring as Demeo. This is a simplified riff on the genres that has you playing attack and ability cards with deterministic outputs, so long as the die rolls in your favour. Additionally, since this is now D&amp;D flavoured, the dice might be 20-sided, but it’s labelled with simple attack markers on all sides, except for a single critical success (doubling damage) and critical failure (whiffing and potentially damaging allies instead).</p>
<p>The cards you have available to you depend on your character, and here we have a hearty bunch of classic D&amp;D classes and races amongst the defined characters. Bolthrax Brightscale is your forthright Dragonborn Paladin, leading the way with his ability to regenerate armour points and soak up damage, allowing Ash the Tiefling Rogue to sneak and stab, while Jessix the Human Ranger marks her quarry and fires arrows from afar, and Tibby the Halfling Sorcerer can send spells of ice and fire to deal elemental damage. There’s two more characters for the full game, and all of them have specific core abilities that will be available all or most turns, and a menagerie of randomised class abilities that can become available to you down the line –&nbsp;Tibby could get a AOE Fireball, for example, Ash a teleporting stab attack that then shrouds her in stealth, and so on.</p>


<p>There’s a good mixture here, and they work well to compliment one another in battle. It’s an easy game to play, gradually revealing the board as you move through the dungeon, kick open doors, and find surprising hordes of enemy goblins, fungal mycopaths, rogue archers and spell-casters, and just swarms of rats. So many rats.</p>
<p>It can be particularly brutal, as each die bounces around on the 3D board scenery and hands down its judgment, with the traditional slew of good and bad luck that would be enough to see you enshrine or melt down your dice in real world D&amp;D. And the randomised levels can be stuffed to the gills with a bunch of hulking trolls to battle one attempt, and more humble opponents on the next.</p>
<p>So far, so Demeo, but Battlemarked embraces the D&amp;D through what’s wrapped around the core dungeon crawling. There’s more storytelling here, and the first of the demo’s two scenarios has one of those traditional D&amp;D campaign openers, as your band of adventurers happens upon a Neverwinter nobleman in dire straits, as he’s attacked by a band of goblins. This wooded scene with a bridge crossing a stream makes for a nice battleground for a bitesized encounter, leading into an opener for the wider campaign narrative, as you’re then invited to escort the nobleman and a late-coming friend back to a tavern in Neverwinter.</p>

<p>You’re also presented with narrative moments, where you can roll actual D20 for skill checks to, perhaps, deceive or intimidate a Myconid guard, give a dexterity check mid-dungeon to avoid a surprise trap, and more.</p>
<p>There’s plenty that’s locked away for the full game, such as character development options and actually getting to visit taverns to pick up side-quests, so the demo gives just a brief but enticing taster of what’s to come. This is also purely flatscreen, with the full game promising PC VR and PSVR 2 support at launch –&nbsp;which I really rather enjoyed for my VR review of this game.</p>

<p>There’s a few knocks to the feature set of the demo that I really hope aren’t issues for the full game, and they mainly come within the settings menu… or the almost total lack of one. Demeo had tons of options for inverting camera controls, button remapping and more, but none of that is present in Battlemarked’s demo. Additionally, there’s no character outlines for characters that are obscured by the scenery, and that’s more problematic with a gamepad, when the zoom and angle is more rigidly fixed. I also wish it was made more abundantly clear that you’ve retrieved the key needed to use the level exit, and which of your characters has it – the icon is just a bit too small.</p>
<p>All in all, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked might have a trickier title to utter than a typical D&amp;D conjuration, but blending Demeo’s moreish dungeon crawling with the trappings of D&amp;D are simply delightful.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Employees at Electronic Arts (EA) and members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) have released a statement regarding the pending acquisition and privatization of the company. In the joint statement, union members working at EA state that they weren’t properly represented during sale negotiations and that there is a worry of company layoffs when it happens. </p>



<p>The group says this $55 billion deal will <strong>“further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of a few gatekeepers while doing nothing to address the concerns of players and workers.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“EA is not a struggling company,”</strong> the statement says. <strong>“With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The group says that if any layoffs take place or if studios close, it’s because of a choice to do so and not something done out of necessity. They say that it would be a move done solely to <strong>“pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statement, the <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union has launched a petition</a> for the United States Federal Trade Commission to look more into this deal. They are “calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom.”</p>



<p>The announcement of a deal to sell EA to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in late September</a>. To fund the sale, EA will be taking on $20 billion in debt, which many worry will lead to the aforementioned layoffs.</p>



<p><strong>“Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services.”</strong></p>



<p>The statement closes by saying that the <strong>“value of video games is in their workers” </strong>and that they are <strong>“standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry.”</strong></p>

But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.</p><p>We also know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove—which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique.</p><p>Of course, development of <em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all our fans around the world for playing our games year after year, for their kind words whenever we meet, for their patience and encouragement.</p><p>This is the beginning of a new chapter for Quantic Dream. Thank you for being with us on this journey, we can’t wait to share what comes next.</p><p>—David Cage</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/quantic-dream-developing-multiplayer-title-star-wars-eclipse-development-ongoing]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Quantic Dream is still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, it's assured in a new blog post, alongside development of a new competitive multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The Star Wars game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>, but in the years since we've seen little of its development. In October 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Now the studio has shared a <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">new blog post</a> from studio founder David Cage entitled "Writing A New Chapter", in which he provides an update on forthcoming projects.</p>

<p>Since 2018 the company has doubled in size and opened a new studio in Montreal.</p>
<p>"After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step," said Cage. "Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><p>"This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA."</p>
<p>He admitted since the studio has "no legacy in this genre" it has "everything to prove".</p>
<p>Cage then added: "Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, but it does suggest more concrete news is on the way.</p>
<p>After a couple of releases, Quantic Dream found success with PS3 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>, which it later replicated with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-and-quantic-dream-shocked-by-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture">multiple French outlets reported on alleged unhealthy studio culture at Quantic Dream</a>, which was refuted by Fondaumière.</p>
<p>Later, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-defends-response-to-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture-at-quantic-dream-in-new-interview">Cage responded to the allegations</a>. "I don't think we had an aggressive attitude," he said. "When you're accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you've done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture."</p>
<p>Lead writer on Star Wars: Eclipse <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">Adam Williams left the studio</a> in 2024 and has since formed a new studio, Republic Games.</p>
