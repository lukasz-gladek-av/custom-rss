            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Monolith's classic survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>has been delisted from digital storefronts, and no reason has been given by the publisher as to why this has happened.</p>

<p>As spotted by Wario64 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3m4iwmggyjz2s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>was taken down from Steam and the Xbox storefront on Halloween. In case you're wondering, it's not available via GOG either, having not been added to that platform's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">excellent Preservation Program</a> yet.</p>

<p>Sega hasn't given any kind of official statement regarding the reason for the game's delisting, and since Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">shuttered by parent company Warner Bros</a> back in February this year, the developer isn't available to comment on the situation either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=6ysfC0Qa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=rRyYlHcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is no longer available on Steam or Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Released back in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is a first-person survival horror game in which you play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who's looking into a spate of serial killings, as well as the homeless population of his city suddenly becoming aggressive and violent.</p>

<p>The game features a mix of tense action-horror combat and exploration, detective mechanics, and mild survival elements. It's a real classic, although I suppose we now have to describe it as a "lost" classic, since it's not available for purchase anymore.</p>

<p>It's possible, of course, that Sega is gearing up to announce a remaster of the game, perhaps alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">remaster</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-shares-update-on-system-shock-remake-release" rel="nofollow">remake</a> connoisseurs Nightdive. That could just be wishful thinking on my part, though; it's equally possible that the game has disappeared for some arcane rights-related reason.</p>

<p><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>was followed up by a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Condemned 2: Bloodshot</em>, which, unlike its predecessor, was ported to the PlayStation 3 as well as releasing for the Xbox 360. This one, however, never appeared on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=dLiKytsC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=m7wJQi3y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Butcher's Creek&nbsp;</em>are carrying the&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>torch.</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, developers like&nbsp;<em>Dusk</em>'s David Szymanski are here to carry the torch, with titles like January's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Butcher's Creek</a>&nbsp;</em>attempting to pay homage to&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>through similar tense first-person survival horror gameplay.</p>

<p>For the time being, sadly, it looks like you'll have to fall back on your physical copy of&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360 if you want to play it. Hopefully, a remaster or remake is announced soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon-2000640785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon.1342126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-14-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday-2000640775</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>

            <p>The Simpsons has a long running couch gag bit, which plays out during the show's title sequence. Sometimes this sees America's yellow cartoon family taking part in a group dance or being abducted by aliens.  There are also times when the fivesome are surprised by some unexpected visitors already plopped down in front of the TV, leaving Homer and co with nowhere to park their own rears. </p>
<p>And, that is exactly what has happened in the latest episode of The Simpsons, this time with familiar faces from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> taking a seat at 742 Evergreen Terrace.</p>

<p>During the opening sequence of The Simpsons' season 37 episode 5 - known as Bad Boys... For Life? - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie all arrive at home to find the likes of Fishstick there. Not a family to take this intrusion lightly, the Simpsons proceed to draw some weapons on the Fortnite lot and, errrr… let Peely know who is boss.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time The Simpsons has given a nod to video games. Last year, during season 35 (I still can't quite believe how long this show has been going for), we got a Mario Kart parody, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-simpsons-mario-kart-parody-is-the-closest-weve-got-to-a-hit-run-sequel">complete with a moustachiod Lisa and a Bowser-esque Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>As for the here and now, this opening is a timely addition to the show's lineup, with Fortnite itself hosting a The Simpsons season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is it fair to call this the Big One? Of all the very many nerd conventions around the world, New York Comic Con certainly has claim to be one of the most defining events in the calendar. So of course&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;ensured Minerablu’s excellent team of photographers were at the event, capturing the best cosplay that appeared on the show floor.</p> <p>As you might imagine, New York Comic Con attracts a host of big-name actors and creators, with 2025 seeing the likes of Hollywood stars like James McAvoy, Elliot Page, Martin Sheen and Ming-Na Wen, alongside writers George R.R. Martin and Joe Hill, voice actors Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson, and all-time heroes like Ernie Hudson, Seth Green and Peter Weller. But we’re not here for autographs; we’re after the most impressive cosplay to walk through the exhibition hall doors. And as ever, we have a mighty-fine selection.</p>

 <p>More unusual costumes include a spot-on Bad Bunny, a Supergirl/Sabrina Carpenter crossover, and—er—quite the Jeff Goldblum. There’s also the finest Predator I’ve ever seen, and what I hope will become a permanent fixture of these galleries:&nbsp;<em>Demon Hunters</em>‘ Derpy.</p> <p>We’ll have a video of the event soon, but meanwhile click on to enjoy the pics.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock-2000640767</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock.1342096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s <em>IdeaPad</em> line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/">has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price</a>, bundling in a full <strong>year of Microsoft 365</strong> alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Computing Power for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/word">download Word for free here</a>) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The <strong>Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks</strong> like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: <strong>fast local storage and massive cloud storage</strong>. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.</p>



<p>The<strong> 14-inch HD anti-glare display</strong> hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The <strong>screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratio</strong>&nbsp;which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. <strong>Two Dolby Audio speakers</strong> flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge</strong> which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, <strong>including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage</strong> we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.</p>
<p>At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-airpods-beats-solo-4-are-now-going-for-cheaper-than-no-name-mid-range-headphones.1342093/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Beats, a brand by Apple, makes some of the best audio gear out there. It offers bold sound, and the headphones play nicely with a range of devices. If you’re after a solid pair of over-ear headphones that do not blow your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">35% discount on the Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones, which brings the price down to $129 from $199</a>. The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick one that matches your aesthetic the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Updated Drivers for Rich, Deep Sound</h2>
<p>The build is sleek yet sturdy, and the headphones are quite comfortable to wear. These feature an UltraPlush cushion that provides a snug fit without putting too much pressure on your ears, so it’s going to be easy to have them on for longer periods. The headband itself is foldable, meaning you can easily tuck the pair into a bag or backpack when not in use.</p>
<p>For powerful sound, there’s custom acoustic architecture with updated drivers. All the highs and lows are delivered well, across all genres. Listening to the Chester Bennington scream in Given Up or just winding down after a long day with a podcast, these headphones hold up well. Best of all, there’s Personalized Spatial Audio support with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive sound that follows you.</p>



<p>A built-in microphone makes calls clearer, and Class 1 Bluetooth makes sure you enjoy an extended range with fewer dropouts. If you want to enjoy audio just the way the creator intended, you can plug in using either the USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable. Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 50 hours of listening time on a full charge, so you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about recharging them. And if you’re running low, Fast Fuel lets you top up with 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>These headphones work well with both Android and Apple devices</strong>, so compatibility won’t really be an issue. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, so you’ll be jamming to your favorite beats in no time.</p>
<p>All things considered, Beats Solo 4 headphones are a great option to consider if you’re after solid audio, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit. These would normally run you around $200, but this deal lets you snag them for just $129. It might be wrapping up soon, though, so it’s better to get your orders in fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keanu Reeves would love to play Johnny Silverhand again, but how can he given the events of Cyberpunk 2077? It turns out Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has worked out a way to make it make sense, and has told the much-loved actor: “contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, speaking with IGN while promoting his movie Good Fortune, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Keanu Reeves said that he wanted to be part of the sequel to CD Projekt's 2020 game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again," Reeves said when asked if he’d be interested in revisiting his legendary rockstar terrorist character in Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves's love-affair with the Cyberpunk community began with his viral "you're breathtaking" moment at E3 2019. Reeves, on-stage to announce the release date of Cyberpunk 2077, was interrupted by a fan who shouted out "you're breathtaking!" Reeves' response was to double-down with his own "you're breathtaking... you're all breathtaking!" Cue wholesome memes across the internet forever more. You can see the iconic gamer moment in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, could Reeves actually play Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2 even if he wanted to? In other words, could Johnny Silverhand return in the sequel, given the events of Cyberpunk 2077?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many players believe Cyberpunk 2077 provided a suitable ending for Johnny and V's story, depending on which ending of the game CD Projekt makes canon for Cyberpunk 2, the door may be left open for Reeves' return. Could Johnny return in cameo form perhaps, having downloaded himself into someone or something else? Canon ending dependent, could V end up becoming Johnny Silverhand in mind and body for Cyberpunk 2? Perhaps we could see Johnny as part of a flashback to events before Cyberpunk 2077, as Cyberpunk 2077 had?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">A History of Keanu Reeves in Video Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like Mike Pondsmith has been thinking about this ever since Reeves’ interview with IGN. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CD Projekt livestream to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, Mike Pondsmith said, matter of factly: “Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith, understandably, did not reveal what those “ways” were, but as we’ve mentioned, there are plenty of theories fans have come up with to make it make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves isn’t the only big Hollywood name to appear in Cyberpunk 2077. Idris Elba starred in the successful expansion, Phantom Liberty, which Pondsmith was delighted by. Indeed, he revealed he worried that CD Projekt might get sued because his character, looked so much like Elba, before it was revealed it actually was Elba playing the role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"'So let me get this straight,'" Pondsmith recalled of his reaction to the news. "'You got Keanu Reeves, and then you turn around and get Idris Elba. What's next? Scarlett Johansson?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Scarlett, you know, I have roles for you. You can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlett Johansson in Cyberpunk 2? That remains to be seen. But Pondsmith has been chatty about the hotly anticipated sequel in the past. In May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with Cyberpunk 2 (then known as Project Orion) at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/gettyimages-1154859517-1762173368424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could Keanu Reeves reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand for Cyberpunk 2? Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the feel of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out. CD Projekt is of course focusing on The Witcher 4, and CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has suggested Cyberpunk 2 won’t be out until at least 2030.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a trend that’s set to continue with next year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, which is set in the fictional U.S. state of Leonida (a reimagining of Florida). And based on the two GTA 6 trailers we've seen so far, that parody of American culture is once again front and center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting time, then, to wonder if GTA might hop on a plane and venture abroad at some point in the future. But it feels unlikely, not just based on Houser’s comments, but based on the GTA brand — built up over decades at this point — and what the public expects from it. Indeed, such is GTA’s relationship with America over the course of its many video games, that a University of Tennessee history professor will teach a GTA college history class early in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-gta-college-history-class-before-gta-6">Professor Tore Olsson recently told IGN</a>: “Video games are great at conjuring fictional worlds, but they also impact players’ thinking about real-world times and places. And just as Red Dead Redemption 2 has shaped folks’ perception of the nineteenth-century American West or Ghost of Tsushima has informed their vision of feudal Japan, millions of people around the globe imagine contemporary America through the lens of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Just think of how many GTA veterans have recognized landmarks in Los Angeles and New York thanks to their hours in Los Santos and Liberty City!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser’s position on GTA is similar to that of the creators of post-apocalyptic role-playing game series Fallout, which has also remained in the United States. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard ruled out leaving the U.S. behind for a future Fallout video game</a>, saying he’s a big fan of the “Americana naivete” that informs so much of Fallout’s tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the wait for GTA 6 goes on, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>May 26, 2026</u></a> the current release date.

			<p>Oh, sequels, what a tribulation you are for both gamers and developers alike. Sometimes a follow-up captures everything you loved about the original game and then manages to expand, develop and refine it. Other times a sequel seems to, with unerring accuracy, cherry pick everything that irked you about its predecessor and, for some obscure reason, seeks to do more of that. Biped 2, I’m saddened to say, is the latter kind of sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Biped 2 Release Date Trailer | November 5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9NDROVfsLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A cute isometric puzzle platformer, Biped 2 tasks you and now up to three co-op partners with navigating your endearingly charming robots around an array of levels. Controls remain as fiddly as ever, though they are oddly satisfying when it finally clicks. Each thumbstick operates a leg of your bipedal bot, so movement requires a whole lot of alternate waggling to get you where you want to go. Precision control is available by standing on one leg and then spinning like a top to plant your other leg on your desired target, until you’re ready to lift your original leg and go again. To travel greater distances you can push both thumbsticks in the desired direction to activate your hover skis and propel yourself forward with rocket-fuelled abandon, though this erratic movement option will be of little help in solving the numerous physics-based puzzles ahead of you.</p>


<p>Biped 2 makes one critical mistake; it assumes you played the original game within the last month or two. Now, maybe you have, in which case you’ll be better prepared for the difficulty spikes you’ll encounter here, but when it’s been five years since you last played Biped, this sequel just feels plain nasty. An unrelentingly gruelling challenge that seems to forget that the players might actually want to have fun together.</p>


<p>It’s important to point out that my co-op partner and I have a rock-solid track record when it comes to these types of collaborative game. We’ve seen off numerous Trines, Double Fine’s finest, and a whole heap of metroidvanias, brawlers, and platformers together. So, when I say that Biped 2 broke us, it really means something. For a game that looks just as cute and adorable as the original, this has ended up as one mean SOB.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the challenges here demand a level of precise control and collaboration that was simply beyond us. With no means of altering the difficulty, you’re stuck trying each obstacle again and again until you reach the point that you relationship might shatter if you play anymore. Take an early challenge as an example, in which your bipeds need to cross a chasm; sections of chunky platforms can be briefly extended by your partner stepping on – using the obscenely fiddly control scheme, remember – three different symbols. As they do this, you need to drunkenly saunter – using the obscenely fiddly control scheme, remember – from each extending and retracting platform to the other. If your partner stands on the wrong symbol, you fall off. If you get the timing even slightly wrong, you fall off. Then if that wasn’t enough, entirely random puffs of wind from the nearby cliff-face blow you from your perch.</p>
<p>After numerous attempts, once you’ve reached the other side – mostly through dumb luck, may I add – you’d think there’d be a shortcut to bring your partner over quickly. Perhaps a catapult or cannon that you could activate? Oh no, my friend, now you must do it all again, only with <em>you</em> pressing the symbols on your side of the chasm instead. This is level three. Suffice to say it turned me into a broken mess.</p>

<p>Thing is, if the control scheme or the physics were more nuanced, this level of challenge would be appropriate, but they’re not. Controls are so clunky and silly they belong in a lightweight party game, not a precision platformer. Meanwhile, the physics regularly misbehave. So, you and your partner might make it across the giant rolling log, alternating your steps so the platform beneath your feet doesn’t disappear, only for the physics to throw you off because, well, reasons.</p>
<p>In short, Biped 2 is in conflict with itself, it wants to be a co-op party game, but it also wants to offer an intense challenge. These two things, like chalk and cheese, don’t belong together, the end result being something entirely insufferable.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Do you enjoy playing co-op games with your partner, child, friend or assorted loved one? Then please, in the name of Zeus himself, don’t play Biped 2. The intense challenge of this sequel can ruin your relationships with those closest to you as you shout and yell at each other in a desperate, but futile, attempt to make it through the most masochistic level design I’ve ever encountered.	</p></div>

<p>Horii is the first video game designer to receive such an award, yet he seemingly remains as humble as ever with his accompanying comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been making games for a long time, about 40 years now, but it’s not just my own efforts, it’s all thanks to the staff who helped me make it, and the users who have always supported me. I’ve levelled up in many ways, done many things, and all my hard work has paid off.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest entry to the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, just recently launched on the Switch and Switch 2 and is likely to be a monumental success over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Horii is also busy at work on the next mainline entry, <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>, which has still yet to receive a firm update or release date since its initial announcement.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-london-1969-likely-remain-only-foray-outside-us-says-dan-houser/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>So far, GTA London 1969 remains the only installment in the franchise to take place outside of the United States. Fans have long wondered if Rockstar would ever return to London or perhaps even bring the series elsewhere in the world. </p>



<p>However, based on the statement relayed by Dan Houser (who wrote all the games in the series save for the upcoming sixth), that seems unlikely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, he explained that the franchise is intrinsically linked to American culture. </p>



<p><em>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Houser <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Rockstar Games in early 2020</a>, so it isn't really up to him anymore. That said, having worked there for twenty-two years, he certainly has a sound inkling as to the way the studio thinks about its prized IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsewhere in the interview</a>, Dan Houser mentioned that his favorite character in the series was GTA IV's Niko Bellic, as the most earnest and nicest of all, although he also mentioned CJ from San Andreas and Michael De Santa from GTA V as standout, partly due to the respective voice actors doing a great job at bringing them to life.</p>



<p>Houser then said he isn't worried about generative-trained large language models taking the jobs of writers because he reckons that LLMs can only create cheap, decent stuff, but are unable to come out with new, interesting ideas, which is where 'magic' comes from in writing.</p>

            <p>Cancelled Rockstar espionage flick Agent ended up being filed away without releasing because the studio found a spy narrative impossible to reconcile with their open-world approach to games, according to long-time GTA writer Dan Houser. Despite that, Rockstar subsequently ended up getting halfway up the road of a secret agent-centric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> DLC before opting to don cowboy hats instead.</p>
<p>If the name Agent isn't ringing any bells for you, Rockstar announced what would've been their take on a Bond-style spy game at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nxFUmSaOU">E3 2009</a>, attaching a PS3 exclusive tag to it. One would assume it'd likely have hit PC at some point, had it not ended up gradually fizzling out into cancellation instead.</p>

<p>In a lengthy interview with Lex Fridman, Rockstar co-founder Houser revealed that Agent went through "about five different iterations" ranging from a game set during the Cold War tensions of the 1970s to something more "current". After rotating through all of those ideas, the writer arrived at the idea that the strengths of Hollywood-style spy stories simply aren't compatible with Rockstar's open sandboxes.</p><p>"I don’t think it works," Houser said. "I keep thinking about it sometimes, I sometimes lie in bed thinking about it, and I’ve concluded that what makes [spy stories] really good as film stories makes them not work as video games. We need to think through how to do it in a different way as a video game."</p>
<p>"I don’t know what it would’ve been because we never got it enough to even do a proper story on it," he then added. We were doing the early work where you get the world up and running, and it never really found its feet in either of them. And I sort of think I know why." Houser's theory is that the "very frenetic" and "beat-to-beat" style of storytelling which sees the likes of James Bond rush all over the world doing missions "against the clock" doesn't fit with the lulls an open world game will have when it lets a player wander off to do their own thing. Houser reckons being a criminal's much more ideal for that, since "you fundamentally don’t have anyone telling you what to do".</p>
<p>The writer touches on this need to marry the 'on the job' and 'off the job' sides of an open world game earlier in the interview, citing GTA 5's Trevor and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> more loosely as occasions when he reckons the studio did well to reconcile the two sides by providing morally grey characters who, to put it bluntly, didn't feel as jarring to go on a murder spree with. On the other hand, Houser said GTA 4's Niko ended up possibly having too much going for him on the story side of things, leading players to feel more empathy for him than would be ideal in terms of him being an "effective avatar in the open world".</p>
<p>To me, the need to serve as a believable hand through which mayhem can be wrought upon the world's always a secondary thing, though that's an easier view to hold now GTA Online's protagonist exists as a go-to silent chaos-causer if I ever feel bothered about going beyond the pail for main story characters. I'd be interested to know whether Rockstar might have looked into trying to balance the spy and agent of chaos sides of any not-quite-Bond in a similar fashion to how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> handles Wei Shen's duelling undercover cop/triad criminal roles. That system's far from perfect roleplaying-wise, but it'd possibly have helped make things fit a bit better. That's assuming just biting the bullet and making a more linear spy game that differs from the standard open-world fare is off the table.</p><p>Strangely, despite Houser saying Agent didn't work because open-world spying didn't mesh, the interview also sees him confirm that that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta5-nearly-had-story-dlc-that-made-trevor-a-007-style-spy-until-it-was-cancelled-and-turned-into-a-gta-online-heist">secret agent-themed single-player DLC for GTA 5</a> was "half-done" by the time it was canned, with the studio moving to work on Red Dead Redemption 2 instead. This add-on was set to see Trevor take on the secret agenting, with Houser saying it was "cute", but "never quite came together". While obviously on a smaller scale than a full game and with a character established as an effective psychopath who can get up to just about anything without it seeming too strange, I'm left wondering how it'd not have seen Rockstar have to find a way to reconcile open worlding and spy storying as they struggled to with agent.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of datminers, the spy-ish save the world narrative in GTA Online's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-online-doomsday-heist">Doomsday Heist</a> seems to have taken on some elements of the canned Trevor DLC. In that case, from what I remember the framing of an agency bringing in a criminal contractor to handle some of their dirty work tends to do the heavy lifting, but the degree of separation being that simple to make does lead you to wonder how a similar wrinkle couldn't have been worked into Agent.</p>

              <p>Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price</a>. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Controller That Goes the Distance</h2>
<p>New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The <strong>battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries</strong> which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now <strong>includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box</strong> for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.</p>
<p>These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has <strong>refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry</strong> for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this <strong>hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort</strong> in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The <strong>Share button integration is really handy</strong>, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.</p>



<p>In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it<strong> wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets</strong>. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.</p>
<p>At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.</p>

              <p>Bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to PCs. If you’re after reliable everyday performance for your office work or even just casual use, a mini PC can do the job well without taking up a lot of desk space. Best of all? You can grab one without paying the full price right now.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/">GMKtec Nucbox G3S Mini PC (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel N95 chip, Windows 11 Pro) is available for $179 on Amazon</a>, down from its regular $249 price. The only catch? This <strong>deal is exclusive to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That said, this might be a good time to consider signing up for Prime if you’ve been on the fence. <strong>Amazon offers a 7-day free trial</strong>&nbsp;so you can take advantage of this discount right away and also enjoy free shipping on your orders. It’s also worth noting that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are right around the corner, and a lot of the best deals will go to Prime members first. A Prime membership costs $139 per year or $15 per month, but if you shop on Amazon even semi-regularly, you’re likely to make that money back in discounts and shipping perks.</p>



<h2>Powerful Processor for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The G3S runs on Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake N95 processor with 4 cores, 4 threads, and speeds up to 3.4GHz. When compared to entry-level chips like N100 or N5095, this one offers up to 36% better overall performance, which makes it ideal for day-to-day usage. The 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes it easy to multitask your way through busy days, while the 512GB M.2 SSD storage provides sufficient space for all your essentials. It’s not massive, but should be enough to store important work files, media content, and even a few games without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’ve got dual HDMI 2.0 ports that support 4K@60Hz output on two displays, which is great for anyone looking for a bigger setup. It also has three USB 3.2 ports, WiFi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and Gigabit Ethernet for reliable wireless and wired connections. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you can get started right away without worrying about any complicated installation procedures or subscription costs.</p>
<p>This deal brings the price of the mini PC down to $179, but don’t wait too long to grab it: The offer might end any moment now.</p>

                <p>Plans are underway to resurrect Saints Row, as the design director for the first game, Chris Stockman, has revealed that he's working on a pitch for a new entry in the open-world franchise that will see it return to its roots.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saints Row Reddit</a>, Stockman said that he had been approached to work on a proposal, which if successful, could be a prequel. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel. I can't say anything more than that, but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams," Stockman said, while adding that it won't be a VR game that's being pitched.</p><p>In a follow-up with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Stockman added that he's "attempting to get the band back together" to work on the game. "I want to bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots. As you know, I directed Saints Row, and I feel the series has strayed way too far away from that. I completely understand why they went that way, but in the end, they kind of painted themselves into a corner they couldn't get out of," Stockman said.</p><p>This doesn't mean that Saints Row is definitely coming back, as preparing a pitch and getting it successfully approved are two different things. Former Callisto Protocol director Glen Schofield recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/">how challenging the process for getting a new game greenlit and funded</a> can be, but that hasn't stopped him from "making calls" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-is-making-calls-about-dead-space-4/1100-6535502/">to get Dead Space 4 approved</a> now that its parent company, EA, is planning to go private <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1759585329081000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2szcV0REzdK1C9jkN7v2Qz">as part of a pending $55 billion deal</a>.</p><p>Released in 2022, Saints Row would be the final game produced by Volition before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/">the studio was closed down in 2023</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-launch-didnt-go-to-plan-embracer-ceo-still-confident-it-will-turn-profit/1100-6507733/">Embracer Group labeled it </a><span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-launch-didnt-go-to-plan-embracer-ceo-still-confident-it-will-turn-profit/1100-6507733/">a commercial flop</a>, and, critically, the game received</span> mixed reviews.

                <p>Microsoft has embraced the ex-boxer meme for its latest Xbox advert, as the company continues with its "this is an Xbox" marketing campaign. Featuring a self-proclaimed ex-boxer, the bizarre advert also spotlighted the new dedicated hardware that recently joined the Xbox family, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVxFfe09-6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qVxFfe09-6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This year has seen Microsoft focus more on the idea of an Xbox ecosystem--rather than on the idea of dedicated Xbox hardware--as it continues work on its next-gen plans for the brand. Recently, Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">how Microsoft is looking to evolve the Xbox ecosystem</a> across multiple devices in the future, hinting at multiple devices and options.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said in August.</p><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has also suggested that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-hints-next-xbox-could-be-like-a-pc/1100-6535797/">next Xbox could be more like a PC</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">and the company is once again partnering with AMD</a> to help build its gaming hardware. While Microsoft has rolled out some flashy marketing for its gaming division, the year has also been rocky for it due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">game cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">studio closures</a>.</p><p>A recent report says that Microsoft has also set astronomically high profit goals for its studios, and recent months have seen it once again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">raise the price of its Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games' former VP of creative, Dan Houser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/" data-ref-id="1100-6473383">left the company in 2020</a>, but he's still a wellspring of knowledge about Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, both of which he was a lead writer on. Houser recently shared his insights into both game series as well as a few of Rockstar's unrealized projects.</p><p>During a nearly three-hour interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lex Fridman on YouTube</a>, Houser touched on GTA 5's uncompleted DLC that would have featured Trevor as a secret agent.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o3gbXDjNWyI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It never quite came together, and it was never finished," recalled Houser. "It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, [we] probably wouldn't have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there's always compromises ... I like making the stories. For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would've personally liked to have done more of that in that company."</p><p>Houser related that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-rockstars-gta-follow-up-agent-was-canceled-according-to-former-dev/1100-6519489/" data-ref-id="1100-6519489">James Bond-style game called Agent was also in development</a>, but the team couldn't get the idea to work in an open-world environment without sacrificing the rising tension of a spy thriller. He added that the team hadn't even set a time period or a story before the project was shut down. Similarly, a Rockstar game about Knights in medieval times didn't make it out of development.</p><p>"[We were] sort of trying to do a version of a mythological game that could have been fun," said Houser. "And you know, [I] still love that idea, but never went very far with it. Knights would be going really far back in history ... It never got to writing any of it. Just did some backstory and played around with a few ideas. But it was always something I thought I would never do, and then kind of fell in love with it a little bit."</p><p>Fridman also asked about two of the enduring mysteries from the Red Dead Redemption games: The man looking for his friend Gavin, and the shadowy individual who knew John's actions. Houser explained that the Gavin story wasn't supposed to have a resolution before sharing this theory on the shadow man.</p><p>"He was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your shadow, your karma, the devil, somewhere," said Houser. "And then we built out his backstory over time ... And so in Red Dead 2, you could interact with him again and. .. or not really interact with him. But he was there and he was meant to be something I suppose any creative is scared of, an artist who's kind of sold his soul to the devil. And that slowly revealed itself. He knows what you're up to. What's never really made clear is, does he know this about everybody? Like, is he following you, or is he able, because of the pact he's made with evil forces, able to do this for everybody? I don't think we necessarily ever clarify that. He's certainly able to do it for you."</p><p>Although Houser wasn't involved in the creation of GTA 6, he has no doubt it will break records upon its debut.</p><p>"I would assume it will because it's so anticipated, and anticipation is the best driver of early sales, as we saw with GTA 4 versus Red Dead Redemption 1," added Houser. "You know, GTA 4 far more anticipated, sold much better early on. So I would assume [GTA 6] will sell really well. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted to make money. "</p><p>Houser recently released a novel, A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath, which is now available <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-a-better-paradise-video-game-novel-grand-theft-auto-writer/1100-6532850/" data-ref-id="1100-6532850">on Amazon</a>.</p>

                <p>Back in 2005, rumors swirled of a Halo MMO in development with Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios. The project came to an abrupt end in 2008 when Microsoft shuttered the studio, however one of the developers on the MMO has spilled the beans on the lost game--and why it was cancelled.</p><p>Sandy Peterson, known for his work on the Call of Cthulu TTRPG and Doom before he moved to Ensemble, has posted a <a href="https://x.com/SandyofCthulhu/status/1982965186781954468" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread on X</a> with his recollections about the doomed Halo MMO, which was codenamed Titan. He says that he was in charge of the universe-building for the project, which was going to be set in the far past before the Halos destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.</p>

<p>"The lowest estimate we &amp; Microsoft had for the game's total income was $1.1 billion," Peterson claims. Earlier reports about the cancelled MMO backed up Microsoft's early commitment to the ambitious project, saying that Titan had been allocated a massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmorpg-had-90-million-budget-pre-cancellation/1100-6257799/" data-ref-id="1100-6257799">$90 million budget</a>.</p><p>According to Petersen, the problem arose when Don Mattrick, who was promoted to head of Xbox in 2007, "realized that his stock bonus was based on the income MS had from games in 3 years." This timing was problematic for Titan, which Petersen said was estimated at the time to need 3.5 years to finish properly.</p><p>"And that’s beyond Mattrick's drop dead date," Petersen concludes. "So by firing ALL of Ensemble, he didn't have to pay for our expensive studio for 3 years and he didn't care about Titan." Petersen doesn't say whether he saw proof that this was the case, or if this is just his read on the situation, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmorpg-had-90-million-budget-pre-cancellation/1100-6257799/" data-ref-id="1100-6257799">earlier reports</a> on Ensemble's closure also noted office politics as one of the main factors in the studio's demise.</p><p>Mattrick's reign at Xbox was largely an unpopular one with fans, with the exec presiding over the Kinect, the much-maligned dashboard redesign, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-changing-xbox-one-policies/1100-6410472/" data-ref-id="1100-6410472">disastrous launch</a> of the Xbox One. "All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made," Petersen added on the Ensemble closure. "I don't believe he did justice to Microsoft stockholders but hey - Don started as an EA hatchet man so what would you expect?"</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The mode still comes with some restrictions, meaning players won't be able to earn Dogtags or Accolades through Casual Breakthrough, and the mode also won't be reflected in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-check-your-stats-in-battlefield-6/1100-6533934/" data-ref-id="1100-6533934">career stats</a>. XP gain will be weighted, with player actions granting full XP, and bot actions only granting reduced XP.</p><p>For now the mode will include two maps, Siege of Cairo and Empire State. Casual Breakthrough is live now, and can be found under the Multiplayer tab in the main menu. Battlefield Studios has invited players to weigh in on the new mode, adding that it will be "monitoring your feedback to determine if further adjustments are needed in the future."</p><p>While players can also play against bots in Battlefield Portal, the studio ended up disabling progression on bot-enabled servers after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">internal data showed</a> that a large number of Portal servers were set up primarily as XP farms. Casual Breakthrough looks like Battlefield Studio's attempt to fill that gap for players who aren't ready for the full PvP experience, but still want to earn progression.</p><p>Battlefield recently received a major new game mode in the form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-red-sec-is-free-to-play-battle-royale-launches-october-28/1100-6535731/" data-ref-id="1100-6535731">Battlefield Redsec</a>, a battle royale mode that is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-with-or-without-battlefield-6/1100-6535767/" data-ref-id="1100-6535767">available as a standalone experience</a> for players who don't own Battlefield 6.</p>

<p>"It looks so good, it runs so well"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Digital Extremes has been teasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a>'s Switch 2 version for a few weeks now, and in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KJqHXg1RkUg?t=1235s">devstream</a>, the studio revealed that we shouldn't have long to wait before we can get our hands on it.</p>
<p>Accompanied by yet more footage of the game in action, Digital Extremes announced that the Switch 2 native build of Warframe will arrive at some point in <strong>2026</strong>. There are no specifics outside of that initial window, we should add, though the team stated that they'll be releasing it "as early as we possibly can in the new year".</p>
<p>The fresh footage showed the game running in handheld on Switch 2 with DLSS enabled, and we have to say, it looks pretty solid. This is still a dev build, but it gives a good indication of load times and how things will fare in close-combat.</p>
<p>This is the second slice of Warframe Switch 2 gameplay that we've seen from Digital Extremes in recent weeks, but this one is made all the sweeter by the thought that we'll soon be able to play it ourselves (<em>hopefully</em>).</p>

Who doesn't want to parade around on a horse that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_animal">looks like it's made of ancient Egyptian embalming tools</a>? Who doesn't want to be trapped in "a perpetual cycle of non-consensual reincarnation" by a god of torture, forced to train up hellbeasts for exhibition to earn your freedom? Who doesn't want to make the Nuckelavee do a croupade?
</p>
<p>"Explore your surroundings, form allegiances, learn occult knowledge, take care of deadly beasts and ride them into the manege in a series of murderous dressage tests," explains the just-launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3532330/SHA_BEAST_DRESSAGE/">Steam page</a> (a manege is a riding arena). "Will you become the planet's next dressage champion and be granted a single wish from its omnipotent god or will you succumb and remain a slave for eternity?" So there's a bit of detective work and faction management to accompany the dressage? I can dig it. Here are some screenshots.
</p>



<p>I also dig the wider doings of US-based developer Lori Vornoy. She's the creator of the well-received, comparably garish roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488590/Dungeons_of_Blood_and_Dream/">Dungeons of Blood and Dream</a>, in which you can equip magic rings whose powers change depending on choice of finger. She's also versed in historical fencing, and describes herself in general as a "medieval weapons person" on <a href="https://linktr.ee/heliofractal">her Linktree portfolio</a>. Many strings to this bow.
</p><p>This isn't the only major horse-based videogame in the offing. There's also the perfectly awful/brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> from Santa Ragione, and the noticeably more cheerful open world hoof-me-do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windstorm-the-legend-of-khiimori">Windstorm: The Legend of Khiimori</a>, which Matt Jarvis once puckishly called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">"Death Stranding on a horse"</a>.</p>

              <p>Who doesn’t love a good holiday countdown? Advent calendars build anticipation, make every single day more exciting, and are fun for both kids and adults. Of course, the whole process gets a bit more creative when it’s a LEGO set.</p>
<p>This year, LEGO is offering its Friends Advent calendar 2025, and it’s already on 40% off at Amazon, bringing the price down to just $21. It’s marked as an <em>Amazon’s Choice</em> product, but there’s no telling how long the discount will last. If you’ve been thinking about grabbing one, now’s a good time to pick it up for less. Keep in mind that all other LEGO Advent calendars are now out of stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4905/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Set Doubles as a Play Area</h2>
<p>The set includes a <strong>total of 237 pieces with 24 buildable surprises, for 24 days of fun</strong>. The theme is about a holiday sleepover with Lego friends; Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo. Each character gets their own cozy mattress to get some beauty sleep, and the crew is also accompanied by five adorable pets, including a guinea pig, a gecko, two dogs, and a cat. To spoil these furry friends, there’s a whole bunch of accessories, like a bone, scratching post, pet bed, food station, and water dispenser.</p>



<p>The whole setup comes together with some magical holiday touches like a cozy fireplace, a sled, a sofa to lounge on, a bright lamp, and a bunch of colorful gift boxes. There’s even a little Lego brick reindeer plushie to round it all out. And since the calendar opens up to double as a small play area, kids can use it to set up the full sleepover scene and get creative with their own stories. Maybe it’s a hot chocolate night while the pets throw their own little party in the corner. Or a Christmas tree decorating session with a surprise visit from Leo on the hobbyhorse! The possibilities are endless, and the fun goes on even after Christmas.</p>
<p>Everything is compatible with other LEGO Friends sets, so it’s easy to keep building. You can even plan a fun streaming night with Lego Friends: The Next Chapter, where kids can get to know the Heartlake City crew and maybe add a few more sets over time to expand the whole setup.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been planning to treat your kids to an exciting advent calendar that fuels their creativity, this set is a great option to consider. It’s now down to just $21 for a short time, which makes it even more approachable.</p>
