<p>The horn section</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Underwater Fire and publisher First Break Labs have just launched a new story trailer for their upcoming puzzle adventure game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/particle_hearts">Particle Hearts</a>, and, simply put, it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>This one will see you playing as The Drifter, a mysterious horned figure made entirely of particles, who sets out on a journey through a savage land... also made entirely of particles. There are a lot of particles, but it's an interesting visual style which, should it run well on Switch, promises to be pretty nice on the eyes.</p>
<p>We don't know who The Drifter is, or what it is capable of, but you'll be relying on its particle-manipulation abilities to solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and befriend creatures, all while trying to work out what the heck's going on — who are you? Why do you have horns? Why's everything so... particle-y?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Particle Hearts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074740/Particle_Hearts/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gain multiple abilities that allow you to manipulate the particles around you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use your abilities to solve puzzles, evade enemies, and gain access to hidden areas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Freely explore open environments any way you’d like.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Experience a story where the line between friend and foe is often blurred. Meet various creatures that help you unravel your purpose in this land.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It all looks really rather interesting, and we're certainly intrigued to see where some of these mysteries go. Fortunately, we don't have too long to wait, as Particle Hearts will be making its way to Switch on <strong>25th August</strong>.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of Particle Hearts? Will you be picking it up later this month? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-coming-in-next-update.1267140/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that a new anti-cheat system will be making its way to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the popular battle royale game's next major update.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>&nbsp;on the official&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, Krafton says the new system is designed to "directly detect abnormal behavior at the deepest layer of the operating system". The game already had kernel-level anti-cheat measures in place, but the new tool will offer "even more precise and effective protection", the studio says.</p>

<p>Essentially, it works as you'd expect kernel-level anti-cheat to work; once you boot up the game, the tool scans for abnormal code, and if it detects any illegal software being used, it'll boot the player using it from the game and ban them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=aVN89Dnb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-shooting.jpg?itok=g8TWlfkl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New anti-cheat tools are coming to&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>in the game's next update.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, the new anti-cheat tools will allow the studio to identify cheaters that were previously difficult to detect, and it'll also "proactively counter advanced cheats, reducing the damage caused by illegal software".</p>

<p>The studio also confirms that the new anti-cheat technology will only run while you're playing&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, and will immediately shut itself down once you exit the game. That feels like it should be fairly standard behavior for anti-cheat tools, but it's a nice reassurance all the same.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that you probably shouldn't use other anti-cheat solutions at the same time as this tool is running. Krafton says that doing so could cause "system conflicts or unexpected behavior", including "unexpected issues during launch or gameplay".</p>

<p>In future, Krafton says it intends to "advance [its] illegal software countermeasures by combining technological innovation with operational efficiency", so there's likely more anti-cheat stuff on the way, especially if this system proves to have flaws in day-to-day running.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=dCIb2-YD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system-motorbike.jpg?itok=2NlK6hxJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>isn't slowing its anti-cheat implementation any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in March, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">shared its 2025 roadmap</a> for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, promising big updates to the game's world, more destructible terrain, and plenty of other improvements. The studio also reported <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024" rel="nofollow">record-breaking sales and profits</a> for its 2024-25 fiscal year back in February.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s future, the game isn't just getting the aforementioned roadmap features; it'll also play host to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">some kind of&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover</a> courtesy of developer Starbreeze, and it'll also serve as a proving ground for Krafton's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">plans when it comes to generative AI</a>.</p>

              <p>Are video game discs popping free of their spindles more often than ever before? That seems to be what some users believe. And what does Samoa Joe think about the recent<em> Battlefied 6</em> open beta? Did he like it? Oh, and everyone loves that new horror movie <em>Weapons</em>, so it’s interesting to hear that the director’s next project might be a really weird and totally fresh take on<em> Resident Evil</em>. All this news and more is featured in today’s hot and ready Morning Checkpoint!</p> <h2>What’s Up With Loose Discs In Video Game Cases?</h2> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvvy4i6q5226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigpnazgvm6tzssz5gsjj4yfkqgu7i2qk77wmr56nvaj5oms5lr5yi"> <p lang="en">I would love for someone to do an Investigative Journalism into why most disc-based games are just rattling around loose in their case when purchased brand new vs affixed to the spindle. This never happened until toward the end of the PS4 era, and now it's basically every game I feel?</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532?ref_src=embed">Brandon Sheffield (@brandon.insertcredit.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3lvvy4i6q5226?ref_src=embed">2025-08-08T19:24:13.437Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Have you bought a new physical video game in the last few years and noticed that the disc was rattlin’ around inside the plastic case? If so, you aren’t alone. Other people have been commenting on this phenomenon, which was brought to my attention via a BlueSky post by Necrosoft Games Director Brandon Sheffield. According to Sheffield, this has been a growing problem since around the final years of the PS4. Others chimed in, sharing that they too had bought a game and found it loose in the case. Many theories have been provided, including changes in plastic, cheaper plastics being used, and less human involvement in packing physical media. Personally, I’d say all of those play a part in games being loose in the case.</p> <p>Oddly, I’ve mostly avoided this problem when buying new movies and games, but I will admit that when pulling out a new game in 2025, those suckers just pop right out with no force. Meanwhile, I needed to use the jaws of life to pry out PS2 games back when I was younger. So something has seemingly changed, that’s for sure.</p>

 <h2>Look At These New <em>Sonic</em>-Themed Shoes</h2>  <p>These upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed Puma sneakers were announced <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">earlier this month</a>, but somehow I didn’t see them until now via social media posts about the cool shoes. These are honestly some rad-looking sneakers, with one big exception: The face bits on each shoe representing the character the shoe is based on. I get it, Sega wants some more branding on the sneakers, but it turns these shoes into cheap-looking things you’d buy on Amazon for $10 a day before your nephew’s 12th birthday party. Anyway, these new sneakers are arriving on October 30.</p> <h2>Samoa Joe Shares His Thoughts On The<em> Battlefield 6</em> Beta</h2> <p>All of my friends played the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta over the weekend. And a lot of people I know online played, too. It seemed like everyone was playing it, including Samoa Joe. Yes, the famous wrestler and actor apparently played a lot of EA’s upcoming FPS over its open beta weekend and <a href="https://x.com/SamoaJoe/status/1954544594483318926">shared his thoughts on social media</a>, saying: “Is the new <em>Battlefield</em> kinda hitting for anyone else, or was the bar so low I’m just grateful? I’m really rooting for the former over the latter.” You are correct, Mr. Joe, the new <em>BF6</em> indeed hits.</p> <h2>Indie <em>Persona</em>-Like RPG Finally Has A Release Date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-launches-september-3">Necrosoft Games recently announced</a> that its upcoming game, <em>Demonschool</em>, finally has a release date. The “school life strategy RPG” arrives September 3. <em>Demonschool</em>, which looks a lot like a never-before-released Game Boy Advance port of a <em>Persona</em> game (in a good way), will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

 <h2><em>Weapons</em> Director Says His <em>Resident Evil</em> Movie Will Be Weird</h2> <p>The biggest movie in America right now is <em>Weapons</em>, a strange horror film from writer and director Zach Cregger. And it just so happens that Cregger’s next project is likely a <em>Resident Evil</em> movie. Cregger, who also created the hit horror flick <em>Barbarian</em>, recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about his video game adaptation</a> and had this to say: “[<em>Resident Evil</em> is] an original screenplay. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other <em>Resident Evil</em> movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.” As someone who finds all the past <em>Resident Evil</em> movies to be dumb, mostly bad action flicks, I’m totally fine with someone coming in to make an actual horror movie based on the franchise. Let’s hope Cregger nails it.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">People used cheats and wallhacks in the <em>BF6</em> beta (Don’t tell Samoa Joe)&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo IV</em> boss Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633">Don’t worry, we ranked every song from Netflix’s massive hit movie <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em></a></li> </ul>  <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>The new <em>Spider-Man</em> movie has been filming for only a few days, but Sony and Marvel already have a trailer.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Day One on Set" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ymmwq55sHY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>Sirland said it would be simply "not fun" and "too random" for players to take damage or die immediately when a room crumbles around them. Instead, the game was intentionally designed to give players a window to escape a busted-out room. "Stay under rubble falling and you'll see. Most for bigger parts," he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6845">And as with Battlefield 6's other elements</a>, the destruction-damage will be "tuned" ahead of launch, Sirland said.</p><p>As for aim-assist, community manager <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1954437485217333734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kevin Johnson reacted to a video</a> showing the differences between aim-assist in Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 6. A single video doesn't tell the whole story and may not be representative of every person's experience, but many have said Call of Duty's aim-assist is more active than Battlefield's. Johnson, for his part, said Battlefield 6 isn't doing anything significantly differently than any past title has. "It is there to assist, and it should guide you during heated moments so that you're able to be in fair standing towards other peripheral users, but not above. YOU are the skill," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta recently wrapped up its first weekend of testing, and it was a huge success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">eclipsing Call of Duty player numbers. </a>Weekend 2 begins August 14, and it includes more maps and modes.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches in full on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

		<p>Bandai Namco and Now Production have released a graphics comparison video for Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, ahead of its launch across PS5 and PS4, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on 26th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="PAC-MAN WORLD 2 Re-PAC - Official Graphics Comparison Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3cvveUuVYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac is a faithful remake of the early 2000s 3D platformer. The Ghosts have snuck into Pac-Village and stolen the Golden Fruit, freeing their ghost king, Spooky, and forcing Pac-Man to travel the lands to reclaim the fruit and foil his plans.</p>
<p>Originally released for PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC, the game is getting a serious glow up with this remake, with Now Production giving a solid modernised take on the source levels and themes, adding a ton more detail and more nuanced lighting.</p>
<p>But it goes beyond that, as they promise new actions for Pac-Man, updated boss battles,&nbsp;characters, collectables, customisations, and a 2-player mode.</p>

<p>Kickstart to your weekend?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>There's something about side-scrolling BMX/motorbike games, don't you agree? They promise big silly accidents, skill-based gameplay that's easy to parse, violent falls from mid-air, fun stunts, incredibly painful crashes and... well, yeah, just loads of falling and people getting rag-dolled.</p>
<p>Now, we've got some good BMX stuff on Switch already, and especially in the form of the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_rising">Trials Rising</a>, but we could certainly do with more, and so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mad_skills_bmx_2">Mad BMX Skills 2</a> may be of interest to any budding [insert BMX rider] out there!</p>
<p>Launching on Switch on <strong>15th August 2025</strong> for just <strong>$9.99 / £9.99</strong>, the game — created by Swedish dev Turborilla — has been around on IOS for a few years now. It's great to see it supports 2-player local fun, as that's always a huge bonus in these sorts of things, and it also has a bunch of cosmetics and unlockables alongside gameplay that, from the trailer at least, looks very decent indeed. Also, boss battles? We'll have some of that.</p>
<p>Can it best Trials Rising by performing at 60fps on Switch 1, well, that remains to be seen, but it would certainly be a feather in its cap if it did.</p>
<p>We'll leave you with some further info and a few screens from the official PR release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mad Skills MBX 2 features dozens of hand-crafted tracks and 7 different BMX bikes. Players can also customize their rider and bike to suit their style.</p>
<p>In Career Mode, players compete against both standard opponents and challenging bosses. A local multiplayer mode is available as well, allowing two players to race head-to-head on the same console.</p>
<p><strong>Mad Skills BMX 2 – main features:</strong></p>
<p>arcade-style BMX racing;<br>
7 unique BMX bikes;<br>
dozens of varied tracks;<br>
boss battles in career mode;<br>
local 2-player multiplayer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writer spent a lot of his youth watching stuff like BMX Beat and Kickstart on TV in the 1980s, so he knows BMX games have always been about the fine balance between the falling and the skills. The ragdolling and the quality of challenge laid before you can see this sort of game either take off, like Elliott and his magical pals in <strong>ET</strong>, or wind up a bit more like Evil Knievel.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab Mad BMX Skills 2 on the eShop later this week.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a>'s engine was updated with features lifted from later versions of the engine to enable PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features like PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution support.</p>



<p>In a new video shared today on YouTube, Ninja Theory's Technical Director Gavin Costello goes over the work that went into porting the second entry in the series to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro, saying that the process was more about porting the technology than the game specifically. Taking advantage of the very good platform integration Epic has in place, the team had no trouble getting the game running and fully playable from beginning to end on Sony's consoles and getting an overview of where the game's performance was. From this point, the developer implemented every feature of the game into the new versions of the game, and also updated the older version of Unreal Engine 5 the game shipped on with new features taken from newer version of the engine to enable some PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive features, like PSSR and variable rate shading. Considering the launch of the PlayStation 5 version of the game will coincide with the release of a new update for the Xbox Series version which introduces a 60 FPS performance mode on Xbox Series X, it is likely these new features have allowed the implementation of 60 FPS gameplay into this version of the game.</p>

<p>Introducing a Performance Mode on Xbox Series X is only <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/">one of the new features</a> that will hit Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II with tomorrow's update. On PC, this new version of the game will introduce a Very High preset that pushes visual fidelity further, as well as Steam Deck verification featuring optimizations aimed at delivering a smooth experience on the system. The update will also introduce a new play mode and other improvements.</p>



<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The PlayStation 5 port, as well as the Enhanced update, will launch tomorrow, August 12.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/recommending-books-is-the-best-part-of-tiny-bookshop.1267095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tiny Bookshop</em> got a surprise launch for Steam and Switch during last Thursday’s Nintendo indie presentation. As the name implies, you run a tiny bookshop in a seaside town, meeting the locals and recommending books to them.</p><p>Your bookshop is run out of a cart attached to a car, meaning that every day you have to decide where you’ll set up shop. People at different locations want different kinds of books: beachgoers want fantasy and kids books, while folks at the coffee shop want classics and drama. The sailors at the waterfront want travel books, while the students at the university want non-fiction. After you visit a place for the first time, their preferences are kept in your journal, and there’s a pleasant pre-departure ritual of stocking your shelves with the kinds of books your potential customers like best.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tiny Bookshop – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i_HlDVtQRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can also boost the sales of specific books with decorative items around the shop. A skull will increase the sales chance of crime, for instance, while a vintage bell will boost the sale of classics. Some items will boost one sales chance while diminishing another, and all of these items will add a small cost to your daily expenses. New items, as well as more books, can be purchased at the weekly flea market or from a day’s edition of the town paper, where you’ll also find the weather forecast and upcoming town events.</p><p>There’s a light narrative atop all this in the form of various recurring characters, who give you small quests to complete as you get to know them. I didn’t personally find any of these characters terribly compelling–they wear their motivations pretty nakedly, and they glom onto you as a newcomer to town with an intimacy I found a bit too fast, but this all makes sense for the limited interactions you can have with them and for the story the game wants to tell about how relationships are formed in a small town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite part of <em>Tiny Bookshop</em> has been the book recommendation system. While characters will mostly handle their own browsing and buying, every so often a character will ask you to recommend a specific book to them. These can be a straightforward request for a short romance or recent kids book, or it can be a more complex preference that could span genres. You scan your shelves for whatever’s turned up or still left, most of which are real books, and then offer them a book you think will meet their needs. If it does, in addition to getting to feel clever about it, the sale will give you a short boost that encourages other patrons to buy more books.</p><figure><figcaption>Neoludic Games</figcaption></figure><p>Besides breaking up gameplay that is largely just watching NPCs buy things, I loved flipping through the titles on my shelves and trying to think of what a character might like or not like. Sometimes the requests are hilarious– one character, with a kid in tow according to their dialogue, disturbingly asked me if I had “anything like <em>American Psycho</em>.” There’s also a lot of humor potential in what you can suggest; I skimmed to Elliot Page’s tragically-titled memoir <em>Pageboy</em> when I was looking for a book for a character who told me “I’m looking for a new hobby,” leading me to ponder whether transitioning is a hobby. I became determined to sell someone <em>Titus Andronicus</em> regardless of age level, or <em>Annihilation</em> when someone asked for a romance with a happy ending. (It didn't work.) Their responses will also sometimes be unintentionally funny: One character, looking for a long book, scolded me when I suggested <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Moby Dick</em></a> because it wasn’t long enough, and another, looking for a romance, reacted with delight like I’d found them the most obscure book in the world when I suggested one of Shakespeare’s romantic comedies. It helps if you know the books, though they also have pretty solid summaries to help you make your decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a literature person, a pretty solid assumption if you’re playing a game about books, making book recommendations is really fun and thought-provoking, and it’s super satisfying when you get one right. You won’t always have something appropriate on hand, especially if it’s been a busy day and your shelves are looking bare, but nothing in <em>Tiny Bookshop </em>is too punishing if you mess it up.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is broken into seasons; I’ve just completed summer, which ends with a surprisingly introspective bonfire. The gameplay has felt a little shallow and repetitive to me at times, but the book recommendations break this up, and, like many “cozy” simulation games, it feels like it’s more about chilling with the vibes than exploring the reality of running a business. (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank god</a>.) I’ve been playing it on PC, but it definitely feels like a game best suited to chilling on your couch, fiddling with your shop decor and flipping through your wares to unwind. There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo on Steam</a> if you want to check it out first.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-best-video-game-boats"><h3>Let’s Remember Some Good Video Game Boats</h3></a><p>"Assassin’s Creed is reinventing interest in sea shanties.

              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is something I’ve never fully grasped, but I can certainly appreciate the concept of a collector’s mindset. For decades, Pokémon players have hunted prestigious cards, either to bolster their collection or to sell on the open market, but some might not be aware of what they have in their deck.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the Pokémon World Championship in California, a little research was put together to outline the super rare Pokémon cards that players might be unwittingly sitting on.</p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-expensive-original-pokemon-card">What’s The Most Expensive Original Pokémon Card?</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Pinnacle</a>, a combination of resale data, keyword trends, and geographical aggregates was used to identify the most expensive original Pokémon cards by market value and popularity.</p>



<p>At the top of the table sat the Gyrados Star card from the Holon Phantoms category, worth an estimated $2,000. This Gold Star card is one of the most searched-for items amongst Pokémon collectors, particularly those in California and Texas.</p>



<p>The second most expensive original Pokémon card is Mewtwo, from the Base Set Shadowless category. This card commands a price of around $900, and it’s one of the super rare Pokémon cards you might have lingering in a binder somewhere.</p>



<p>Here’s Pinnacle’s data from the top ten most expensive original Pokémon cards:</p>



<ol>
<li>Gyrados Star (Holon Phantoms) – $1,999</li>



<li>Mewtwo (Base Set Shadowless) – $900</li>



<li>Venusaur (Base Set Shadowless) – $793</li>



<li>Rocket’s Snorlax Ex (Team Rocket Returns) – $595</li>



<li>Sabrina’s Gengar (Gym Heroes) – $579</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set) – $455</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set Shadowless) – $420</li>



<li>Dark Charizard (Team Rocket) – $386</li>



<li>Rocket’s Mewtwo (Gym Challenge) – £336</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set 2) – $311</li>
</ol>



<p>To get this list, Pinnacle used a seed list of the most valuable Pokémon cards, then combined that with the current market price (fluctuations can happen) and keyword data from Google to produce the ranking. </p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards in your collection? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

EA and developer Battlefield Studios are well aware of this problem, with one of the measures taken being the implementation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-how-to-turn-on-secure-boot-on-pc/1100-6533761/">Secure Boot technology</a> for the PC version of the game.

"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Could Be The Successor To Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 The Series Needs | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>While SecureBoot isn't foolproof, EA claims it has used it alongside other measures to crack down on cheating significantly. According to EA, 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls were prevented with Javelin anti-cheat alone--as of August 8--thousands of cheaters were reported each day, and its Battlefield teams are coordinating efforts to improve the integrity of the game.</p><p>Echoing the statements made by Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-the-day-we-die-battlefield-6-devs-talk-anti-cheat/1100-6533635/">about being locked in an anti-cheat arms race</a>, EA says it'll continue to work on staying a step ahead of cheaters. While there are several reasons why gamers will use cheats to gain an advantage, one thing is for certain--<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-multimillion-dollar-grey-market-for-video-game-cheats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the market for cheats can be <em>very </em>lucrative.</a></p><p>The second Battlefield 6 open beta starts on August 14, and in the wake of the first weekend, there has been a lot of discussion about the game. Former AEW champion--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-star-anthony-mackie-is-a-big-fan-of-these-classic-games/1100-6533429/">and noted gamer</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/samoa-joe-shares-his-battlefield-6-impressions-and-they-are-highly-relatable/1100-6533826/">Samoa Joe also hopped into the beta on the weekend</a>, and he's wondering if Battlefield 6's positive reception is being shaped by Battlefield 2042's poor reception.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will launch on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|sS.</p>

<figure><a title="mc Donalds Japan Pokemon meal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60ef64327cfdc/mc-donalds-japan-pokemon-meal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>McDonald's restaurants in Japan seem to have got a little more than they bargained for over this past weekend, as a promotion between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and the company's Happy Meals <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">had to shut down early</a>. The reason? "Higher-than-expected sales". However, it appears there's more going on here — and, as you can guess, scalpers seem to be involved.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/1c1915d3214b722cc3eebc6d467ba25b5e23dc65">Yahoo Japan</a> and as seen on social media (cheers, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/10/japan-mcdonalds-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-due-to-higher-than-expected-sales/">MyNintendoNews</a>) customers have been showing off counters in stores that are lined with wasted food, purchased only for the Pokémon cards inside. The promotion was originally due to run between 9th and 11th August, but was pulled after just 24 hours.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnyjurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The huge food wastage, and rather obvious surge in popularity combined, was enough to force the fast-food chain to wind the promo down ahead of time. McDonald's Japan said: "We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of this distribution."</p>
<p>It concluded that customers should "refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/mcdonalds-japans-pokemon-promo-backfires-ends-in-scalping-and-food-waste-contr/504139">Campaign Asia</a> reports that, in some McDonald's stores, customers were calling the police due to rising tensions between some and those they suspected were buying to scalp the cards online.</p>
<p>There are also a whole bunch of rather shameful posts all over social media from the weekend, most showing off food that was dumped by scalpers. At least there were also <a href="https://x.com/iijNWqUQ7i41630/status/1954325909106041136">a few pigeons</a> getting involved for some free grub too. Silver linings and all that.</p>
<p>The plan, in order to deter troublesome scalping in the first place, had apparently been to limit customers to five of the Pokémon Happy Meals per person but, of course, scammers have very quickly managed to circumvent this by using online accounts</p>
<p>Though one customer did attempt to buy <em>40</em> Happy Meals in-store.</p>

<p>McDonald's in the UK has had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">Pokémon back in-store of late</a>, too, although it seems they have managed to swerve scalper problems this time out, having perhaps learned their lesson <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">following an incident in 2021</a> that saw much the same sort of chaos in the US following the launch of Pokémon Happy Meals there.</p>
<p>Still, scalping is a huge problem for the TCG, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">some ignoring tornado warnings</a> just to buy packs to resell.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Making a Far Cry TV Series with FX]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-making-a-far-cry-tv-series-with-fx.1267050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the recently confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed live-action TV series at Netflix</a>, Ubisoft has confirmed that it has another adaptation of one of its franchises in the works. This time, it's in collaboration with FX, and it's a TV series adaptation of the Far Cry franchise.</p>



<p>But this announcement isn't like the Assassin's Creed one, because it wasn't supposed to be live. Ubisoft let the news slip on its website before quickly redacting and redirecting the page, though not quickly enough that it wasn't shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a> and caught by the rest of the internet.</p>



<p>The details of the series which remain on Reddit reveal that the series is set to be an anthology, where "<em>each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding the talent behind the series, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star and co-creator Rob Mac <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rob-mcelhenney-legally-change-name-rob-mac-1236443403/">(formerly known as Rob McElhenney)</a> and Noah Hawley, the creator and writer behind FX's Fargo series and more recently its soon-to-debut at the time of this writing Alien: Earth series are leading the charge on FX's take on the world of Far Cry.</p>



<p>Mac is set to star in the Far Cry series, at least for the first season, presumably, while Hawley will take showrunning duties. Mac will also be an executive producer alongside Hawley, Jackie Cohn of More Better Productions, Michael Garcia of 26Keys Productions, and Nick Frenkel of 3Arts Entertainment. For Ubisoft's part, Gerad Guillemot, Margret Boykin, and Austin Dill are alongside as executive producers from Ubisoft's film and television division. </p>



<p>Boykin, head of Ubisoft's film and television division, is quoted as saying "<em>This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling</em>."</p>



<p>Since it'll be an anthology series, there's no expectation that it'll try to follow in the footsteps of previous Far Cry games. It's more likely that the show will focus on telling its own stories, so maybe don't expect Vaas to show up or anything like that. That said, there's always the chance Mac and Hawley could do their own thing with the show while leaving a few Easter-eggs for fans of the games to pick up on. Hopefully, we'll know more about it soon, whenever Ubisoft decides to put the news back on its website.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview between YouTuber MrMattyPlays and ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), in which Darrah says that BioWare suggested remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, to be released as&nbsp;<em>The Champions Trilogy</em>.</p>

<p>According to Darrah, though, EA is "against remasters", and while he doesn't exactly know why, he wryly says it's because the publisher "basically seem[s] to be against free money". Given EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/buying-fifa-loot-boxes-is-fair-according-to-ea" rel="nofollow">championing of loot boxes</a> in the likes of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, I'm not sure about that, but I see his point.</p>

That's another reason no trilogy remasters were made, Darrah says.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that while all three&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>games were made in Unreal Engine 3, all three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games constituting the series' original trilogy were made with different engines, so remastering them would have been a more difficult task. Still, I'm sure there was a way to get that work done, so it's a shame EA decided not to.</p>

<p>While the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game remains in active development (<a href="https://fextralife.com/bioware-clarifies-the-status-of-mass-effect-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as far as we know</a>),&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s future as a franchise looks to be a little more in doubt.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>underperformed for EA, and CEO Andrew Wilson seemingly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">insinuated back in February</a> that the game's failure could be put down to its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>Whether that means we'll get another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game with a more live-service bent, as&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was meant to be, remains to be seen. Perhaps BioWare will be able to convince EA to make another game in the series, or maybe it will be shelved for the time being. Only time will tell.</p>




<p>For now, you can content yourself with the fact that the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy is still on sale on PC via Steam, and&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is also available now, although you may well find it an acquired taste if you're a huge fan of the originals (particularly&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>).</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Some upsetting news from the past weekend: Bithell Games, the Mike Bithell-founded indie studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a> and the just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, are laying off 11 developers. That’s "The majority of our full-time staff," according to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">post</a> on Bithell’s personal Bluesky account.</p>
<p>The redundancies follow a sad pattern of widespread job losses – albeit usually in much larger numbers – across the games industry in recent years. In Bithell Games’ case, they’re allegedly the result of the studio "being unable to secure a new larger-scale project" to follow Tron: Catalyst.</p>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell’s statement reads. "We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible."</p>
<p>It also claims that ongoing support for currently-available games will be unaffected. Bithell Games as an entity will also continue to exist, though following these layoffs, it’s hard to see how their next game (if any) will follow much of their previous post-Thomas work in using a well-known licensed property as a basis. Which is sort of a shame in itself, as the company’s creative takes on what could have easily been rote tie-in games – for series that would appear to dwarf the scope of a team that only ever numbered in the low double figures – have always been admirably eye-catching. John Wick Hex was not a brainless shooter but a stylish and precise strategy adventure; Catalyst, a thoughtfully executed top-down RPG. That kind of boldness is easy to respect, and will be likely missed.</p>
<p>Alas, so cutthroat is modern game development that almost no known measure of success will effectively block the knife. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">financially lucrative games</a>? Layoffs. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">critically acclaimed games</a>? Layoffs. Be owned by one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">richest and most profitable companies on Earth</a>? Believe it or not, straight to layoffs.</p>
<p>At least in response, developers have been pushing harder than ever before towards unionisation and stronger protections for game industry workers. The The UVW-CWA (United Videogame Workers/Communication Workers of America) launched the US and Canada’s first industry-wide, direct-join union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">at GDC this year</a>, while just this month, QA staff at Call of Duty co-dev studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-qa-staff-secure-union-contract-with-microsoft-to-stop-them-being-treated-like-cannon-fodder">signed their first union contract</a> with Microsoft and Activision-Bizzard.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><span>got a remastered trilogy collection in 2021</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans have been hoping and praying BioWare’s fantasy RPGs might get the same treatment. If there were ever a time to put one out, it would have been before </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>launched in 2024 and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>seemingly wrapped up</span></a><span> most of the universe’s ongoing story threads. According to ex-BioWare boss Mark Darrah, the studio was more than up for remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span> in one collection and told Electronic Arts as much, but the publisher turned down the pitch.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><span>YouTuber MrMattyPlays sat down with Darrah</span></a><span>, who worked as executive producer on the </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> series and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>troubled loot shooter </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>. During the conversation, Darrah reveals that BioWare “soft-pitched” a remaster of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> games but EA turned it down, partially due to its noted dislike of remasters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“EA’s historically been—and I don’t really know why, but they’ve even said this publicly—they’re kind of against remasters,” he said. “I don’t really know why. It’s strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that’s part of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, one of the bigger issues in remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> compared to </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> was that the resources to zhuzh up those games is that they’re on different engines The first two </span><i><span>DA </span></i><span>games were made on BioWare’s internal Eclipse Engine before the team transitioned to Frostbite for </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span>, whereas the first three sci-fi games are all on Unreal Engine. This meant that the technical lift would have been significantly higher for a </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>remaster than it was for </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</span></i><span>. Darrah says the project would have either required hiring a new team to work full-time learning how to use the games’ old tech, or that existing staff at BioWare would have to handle the entire thing on their own. He also says that an internal remaster within BioWare would have been the ideal scenario, but that didn’t pan out.</span></p> <p><span>The soft-pitch Darrah talks about included a sort of “rebrand” of the original games as a trilogy called </span><i><span>The Champions Trilogy</span></i><span>, referencing the three protagonists of each game. If that had come to pass, I would have written you a novel on my feelings about it, considering I think continuity is one of </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>‘s weakest aspects, and branding those games as a trilogy when it decidedly doesn’t follow through on a lot of its connective tissue would be an odd Hail Mary. But since that isn’t happening, I will bite my tongue.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, Darrah doesn’t know what the future holds for </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. He </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859"><span>left the company in 2020</span></a><span>, but returned as a consultant to help get </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>past the finish line. Since leaving the company, Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>has been pretty candid</span></a><span> about what he and his colleagues felt was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-development-mark-darrah-live-service-2000615972"><span>unfair treatment of the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> by management.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Beta Impressions – Battlefield is Back]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-%E2%80%93-battlefield-is-back.1267032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Okay, I’ll admit it. This impressions article was meant to go live during the Battlefield 6 Beta, but the game was so enjoyable for me that I couldn’t stop playing. It’s not an excuse, it’s a fact. This is probably the most time I’ve put in a game, never mind a Beta, in a very long time.</p>



<p>At the end of weekend one, I accumulated 36 hours of playtime, averaging 9 hours per day. To some people, that might be on the mediocre side, but for me, it was the first time in years that I’ve lived and breathed a video game. I felt like a teenager again with zero responsibilities and a never-ending desire to keep playing, and that, my friends, is a magical feeling. </p>



<p>But before my impressions and feedback, I want to give some massive credit where it’s due. I’ll be the first to admit that when I first heard about EA’s all-in approach to Battlefield 6, I wasn’t just worried, I was petrified. The last two installments (Battlefield 5 and Battlefield 2042) were disappointing for me and the wider community for various reasons. EA’s decision to double down on the franchise, especially following the disastrous release of Battlefield 2042, could have ended catastrophically.</p>



<p>But thankfully, Battlefield Studios, which consists of DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion, has done a fantastic job. Yes, there are a few issues here and there, but again, this was just a Beta. The important thing is that the foundations of a great Battlefield game have been laid, and all four studios deserve a massive congratulations, especially with the challenges they faced during development. </p>



<h2 id="h-movement-and-gunplay">Movement and Gunplay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6’s gameplay has been a hot point of discussion this past week, with the game being compared closely to Call of Duty. While I don’t disagree with that sentiment, I also don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing. To me, movement feels like a pretty good balance of that classic Battlefield feel with a few aspects of Call of Duty sprinkled in. Mainly, the new improved movement system (whatever they’ve called it) feels great and presumably will come into its own with Ripple Effect’s Battle Royale mode.</p>



<p>Guns also feel great, and while I spent most of my time with the LMGs, I do think there needs to be some variation between all the weapons. With the right attachments, every gun felt like a laser beam and had a rapid time to kill, regardless of the range. SMGs could do just as well as an assault rifle or LMG in the right hands, and I did become slightly frustrated with how quickly I was dying against the wrong type of weapon.</p>



<p>The developers have weighed in on this on social media and believe that the time to kill (or time to death) is a netcode issue, so hopefully that is something that’s addressed by launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="h-maps">Maps</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there were only three maps available in weekend one of the Beta, I feel like we got a good balance of what the game has to offer. Yes, the maps are small in scale on Siege of Cairo and Iberian Offensive, but I believe the most critical aspect of map design is that they must play well, regardless of size. Thankfully, I feel like both of these maps play well, and I had no issues – apart from people climbing on the roofs on Siege of Cairo.  </p>



<p>Liberation Peak is the largest of the three maps, offering aerial combat. I don’t tend to play in air vehicles, but this map from an infantry perspective played terribly in Conquest and got progressively worse as the Beta went on. I’m not sure if it was intentional or not, but by the time weekend one of the Beta ended, the mountains were covered in glints from sniper rifles and people raining down bullets from quite frankly, stupid places where they probably shouldn’t be able to climb. </p>



<p>It completely ruined the flow of the map, and while I think it’s easily addressed by limiting the climb height of the mountains, I do think the map needs to be reworked slightly. Perhaps a large tunnel through the middle of the mountain, or some large bunker complex, would work well and offer some close-quarters combat apart from the area near the D flag. </p>







<p>One of my biggest gripes with the game thus far is the menus. To me, they are pretty overwhelming even for an experienced Battlefield player, and with Battlefield Studios wanting an easier barrier to entry across the board for the game, the menus need some serious simplification.</p>



<p>From the overall settings to even just modifying my weapon during a match, everything needs to be streamlined to make navigation easier. Having to click four to five times to just change a scope on my gun during a game seems a bit excessive and could be a turn off for many new players.</p>



<h2 id="h-player-visibility">Player Visibility</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another gripe was player visibility in Battlefield 6. While I did manage to “get used to it”, it was still tremendously difficult to spot players if I wasn’t aiming down sights with a 3-4x magnification scope. Often, I would find myself outgunned simply because I wasn’t moving and aiming down sights.</p>



<p>This issue is slightly more exaggerated when you’re either looking into a building or looking out of one. While I understand it from a logical lighting perspective, you should be able to see players shooting from a window or in a broken building, and likewise, the brightness aiming outside a building is way too bright.</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure on a solution here, but I do think there needs to be one. Let’s not introduce wacky skins to make that happen, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, I think Battlefield 6 will shape up to be a brilliant game. A majority of the bugs and issues I encountered are easily fixable within the two months remaining until launch, and I’m confident that Battlefield Studios will be able to address them.</p>



<p>There are undeniable signs that they want to convert the Call of Duty audience this time around, and with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (releasing November 2025), will rely on nothing but nostalgia this time around, EA and Battlefield Studios are in a strong position to do just that. </p>



<p>I think a key mode to success here will also be Ripple Effect’s Battle Royale mode, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to be a free-to-play experience according to our sources</a>. With Call of Duty: Warzone experiencing a sharp decline over the past couple of years and seemingly no way to bring back players, it could prove to be an excellent opportunity for Battlefield. Simply put, I think there’s a strong desire for a new free-to-play Battle Royale in the market.</p>



<p>If released in Q1 2026, it will give Battlefield a second (or third if you consider the holidays) injection of players and likely on a mass scale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Dragon Age franchise boss Mark Darrah has discussed BioWare's difficulty getting a remaster of the series' first game off the ground, and why it would be a much tougher project than Mass Effect's trilogy re-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, speaking about the future of the Dragon Age series after the mixed response to last year's Veilguard, Darrah told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0&amp;ab_channel=MrMattyPlays" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MrMattyPlays</a> that he was "not sure" how a new entry in the series would get started. Darrah has spoken in the past of how BioWare is now a single-project studio, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">the company now slimmed-down in size</a> and solely focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, that leaves Dragon Age on pause for the forseeable future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Darrah said, he believed BioWare should next focus on remakes of the series' first three games, starting with Dragon Age: Origins — something that had previously been discussed, but has not happened for various reasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I honestly think they should do — I don't think they will, but they should do — a remaster of the first three [Dragon Age games]," Darrah said. "One of the things we pitched at one point — pretty softly, so pitched is a massive overstatement — was to retroactively rebrand the first games as if they were a trilogy, call it the Champions Trilogy, so you have these larger-than-life heroes... maybe you do that as a first step.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You shine them up, you re-release them — probably remaster, probably not a remake — see what happens and maybe go from there," Darrah continued. "I'm very curious to see... in a weird, twisted way, the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise are in similar states. They have a trilogy of games that are pretty well received, and then a fourth game that's less well received. I'll be curious to see what Mass Effect does with Mass [Effect] 5 — how does Andromeda fit in there?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early trailers for Mass Effect 5 acknowledge the Andromeda galaxy, and there is an expectation among fans that the events of the sci-fi series' fourth entry will be a part of the game's narrative — even if the main thrust of the game's story will be back in the series' original Milky Way setting, following more familiar characters, alien races and themes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So why hasn't a Dragon Age remaster happened? Well, according to Darrah, a lack of enthusiasm within publisher EA is at least partly to blame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"EA's historically been — and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly — they're kind of against remasters," he continued. "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly-traded company to seemingly be against free money but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The other problem is, Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do. To some degree unknowably harder, maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder?" Darrah pondered. "One of the very earliest things for Joplin [BioWare's initial version of Dragon Age 4, before its multiplayer reboot, and before the subsequent single-player version that became Veilguard] was, 'let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented, and just uplift them, and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other words, Darrah is saying that during the early days of development on Dragon Age 4, a remake of the franchise's first chapter was discussed — even if it never moved forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were lots of pitches around, is there a way to bring Dragon Age: Origins forward? And depending what you do, a remaster you kind of get Dragon Age 2 for free, a remake you don't."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the difficulties in working with Dragon Age: Origins already-archaic engine made it a harder task than remastering Mass Effect (whose entire trilogy was made in the more commonly-used Unreal Engine), and hiring people to either work on a remaster within BioWare or work with an external team was a tough sell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can't really remaster Dragon Age externally, you probably have to do it internally," Darrah said. "The studios run their own financials within themselves, and to some degree EA's stance was probably 'sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have'," Darrah said. "And it was like, we can't do it with the money we already have because we're doing all these other things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for BioWare's future, Mass Effect 5 is now in early production, but still seems to be years from release. A few months ago, we did at least get <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-wait-for-mass-effect-5-director-seemingly-confirms-returning-feature">confirmation of one particular returning feature</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The story so far: In December 2024, Tencent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/tencents-light-of-motiram-looks-very-very-familiar/">revealed Light of Motiram</a> and everyone, and we mean everyone, said the same thing – they had ripped off Sony’s Horizon series, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>The game featured a red-haired girl fighting very familiar mechanical beasts with a bow and staff, creeping through waving red grass to avoid detection, gliding with a glider, and interacting with characters wearing equally familiar costumes. They also nicked the Ghost from Destiny as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In July this year,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/sony-sue-tencent-clone-horizon-light-of-motiram/"> Sony sued Tencent</a> and the lawsuit stated that Light of Motirm is a “slavish clone” of its games, that copies multiple elements that would confuse consumers. They also reference many video games websites that noted the similarities. They asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Tencent had pitched a new Horizon game to Sony but they declined the offer. It seems that Tencent went and made it anyway, and when Sony were made aware of the clone they contacted Tencent to try to solve things without lawyers. At this point someone a Tencent decided the best thing to do was to pitch their Horizon idea to Sony again. Flabs were probably very gasted over at Sony at that point.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today, where Tencent have wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine. One of the original screenshots does remain but the protagonist is in shadow under a glider and could be anyone really.</p>
<p>The new description is very generic.</p>
<p>“Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.”</p>

<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157943/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It is testament to Konami’s back-catalogue, from an era when it was the undisputed king of the 16-Bit and 2D arcade craft, that it can muster so many extraordinary compilations. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a> joins both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary</a> releases, and Digital Eclipse's wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_the_cowabunga_collection">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, as yet another essential for purveyors of fine gaming antiquities. M2, long-time Konami collaborator and the professional darlings of the porting industry, return here, adding Gradius Origins as another key entry in their expansive <strong><a href="https://m2stg.com/en/">ShotTriggers</a></strong> library.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the Switch is usually the bottom of the pile when it comes to cross-platform input lag tests. This is less an issue in 3D games, but for 2D - and especially those in the shooting game genre - it’s critical. While input lag can never be perfect, Gradius Origins feels wonderfully tactile, with M2 eking out responsiveness in ways not thought possible. Playing as uniformly close to the arcade originals as one could hope, this is a celebration of seven wonderful titles - six new, and one brand new title. And, while 1988’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_life_force">Salamander</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/life_force">Life Force</a> are technically the same game, they feature very differentiating regional and mechanical nuances. For many, the latter is considered a something of an upgrade overall.</p>
<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For clarity, <strong>Gradius</strong> is a series built around a one-life clear, or as near enough as possible. Typically, dying in mid-to-late stages and being stripped of all power-ups is extremely difficult to come back from. Salamander, on the other hand, is a more immediately accessible spin-off series, replacing the cycling power-up menu with standard icon grabs that instantly enhance your craft.</p>
<p>Salamander does away with checkpoints, allows you to grab Option pods and weaponry back after death, and showboated back in 1985 with a wealth of awesome digitised speech. Here, M2 have provided optional in-game subtitles for this, too, present at the foot of the screen. Perhaps Salamander’s salient gimmick, and now a series staple, is that it switches dynamically between horizontal and vertical stages, prompting you to “go up” after the stage one boss. It also heralds the introduction of the Lord British ship, accompanying Vic Viper in the player two position.</p>

<p>Gradius (1985), Salamander (1988), Life Force (1988), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gradius_ii">Gradius II</a> (1988), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/gradius_iii">Gradius III</a> (1989), and <strong>Salamander 2</strong> (1996) are now joined by <strong>Salamander III</strong>, an all-new entry in the series, crafted by M2. The last original entry prior was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/gradius_rebirth">Gradius ReBirth</a> - also by M2 - released seventeen years ago on the Wii Virtual Console. To that end, Salamander III isn’t just an arbitrary bonus; for many it represents the sole reason for purchasing the collection. And, M2, clearly aware of both the responsibility and reputation, have delivered an exceptionally accurate return to Konami’s beloved franchise.</p>
<p>Salamander III kind of does it all. While it plays like Salamander, it takes boss, stage and enemy elements from Gradius. Here, Vic Viper, toting a stronger laser, and the Lord British craft a stronger Ripple weapon, are fighting back the Salamander army yet again. Both now feature a powerful Burst shot that can be used freely on a reheat timer, clearing paths through organic matter and debris. The series’ quirky 80s adventure vibe slaps a smile on your face early on, with the announcer warning you to watch out for Moai heads embedded in muscle tissue, and while the recognisable bacteria theme is present, Salamander III veers through asteroid fields, Gradius III-like sand ruins, and the mammoth techno-corridors of a superfortress.</p>

<p>Graphically, it sits authentically in the pocket of mid-90s arcade games, and is a blast to play from the outset, full of urgency, adrenaline, and blazing lasers. The first loop is satisfying to work through, and surprisingly (and for some, encouragingly) easy, dishing out extra lives like there's no tomorrow. Loop two introduces more to dodge and some jazzed up enemies, and is ten minutes longer, tougher, and the only way to face the true-last-boss. You can go beyond this, but by loop four it's plain insanity in fast forward.</p>
<p>Is it the best of the Salamander series, though? No. While solid, there’s a lot in here that feels a little like a remix as opposed to a wholly original outing, perhaps drawing too heavily from past elements right down to its hitboxes and graphical stylings. Salamander 2’s stunningly beautiful, colourful, wonderful arcade chunkiness, snazzy set-pieces and boundless invention still make it the salient entry, with a deeper, more exciting risk-reward Option system. It's incredible to think that on release it was a game much maligned by an ignorant gaming press. Today, depending on shooting preferences, it's arguably Salamander's gold standard.</p>

<p>Salamander III, while the draw, overshadows another delicious bonus: <strong>Gradius III AM Version</strong>, which was only shown at trade shows in Japan prior to the alpha release, and hasn’t been seen since. Well, it’s here now, and poses a very interesting curio for series fans. This being an infamously, soul-crushingly difficult game, however, one might consider dropping the difficulty or employing the rewind function to see more of it.</p>
<p>The rest of the collection, which documents the series over the years, is beautifully presented. There are accompanying storylines at the selection screen, and even a well-considered warning that Gradius III is so hard it’s likely to grind you to dust before you finish it. M2's now standard "Gadgets" are in full effect, allowing you to configure information about every on-screen detail, display hitboxes, adjust auto-fire rates, and make use of replays and online leaderboards. You can adjust screen dimensions, tweak filters, buttons, HUD displays, and, bar Salamander III - which is purposely excluded from cheat-your-way-through tinkering - utilise a rewind function at the press of a button. This now-expected attention to detail makes all the difference, breaking down each entry into not just regional variations, but also their respective PCB updates.</p>

<p>You’re encouraged to explore each variant, and footnotes on the select screen will give you a useful overview of what the key differences are. Each title features a bespoke Easy option created specifically for the collection. These exist separately to the configurable difficulty settings that were part of the arcade hardware, making Konami’s wonderfully goofy but fairly challenging space war universe all the more accessible. If that weren't enough, there are galleries full of original concept and promotional art, and music players to groove to.</p>
<p>While there’s so much glorious stuff here, one may still feel disappointed that <strong>Gradius IV</strong>, Treasure’s incredible <strong>Gradius V</strong>, <strong>Gradius Gaiden</strong>, and even M2’s own Gradius Rebirth, aren’t included. It’s difficult to complain there’s not enough here, because there’s plenty, but fans will know that many of the absentees are considered high points. Salamander III, however, does a lot to smooth over frustration in this regard.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>M2, famous for its articulate, somewhat surgical approach to porting historical code just right, has done another fine job with Gradius Origins. There’s so much polish here it positively gleams, and the overall care, bonus gadgetry and quality of life extras are all impeccably set. Salamander III is the big one, and it delivers, even if it doesn’t really push the envelope in terms of originality or visual bombast. It’s a shame there are still Gradius absentees in the list, and one day perhaps a truly comprehensive compilation will rear its head. For now, though, it’s time to saddle up and destroy the core like never before.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forza-motorsport-and-forza-horizon-5-will-continue-being-supported-even-after-the-recent-cuts.1267005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, Turn 10 was allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned into a Forza franchise support studio</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another round of cuts</a> at the Microsoft-owned developer. Following the dire news, fans have been wondering whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Motorsport</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> would continue being supported with new updates and fixes.</p>



<p>The official answer came a few days ago via the official Forza Motorsport account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community. We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.</em></p>



<p>Truth be told, there were few worries about the latter game. While nearly two years older, Forza Horizon 5 was much more critically and commercially successful. The open world racing game recently launched on Sony's PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to top charts there</a>, too, showing the game's strength even four years after its original debut on PC and Xbox Series. There's little doubt that there will be a Forza Horizon 6, and according to some rumors, it may not even be that far off. </p>



<p>However, a new Forza Motorsport may be a lot harder to imagine if Turn 10 has really been turned into a support studio. In the meantime, the 2023 game just saw the reactivation of the Track Toys Tour, which has now permanently returned to Forza Motorsport alongside its associated reward car: the 2019 Porsche #70 Porsche Motorsport 935.</p>



<p>Track Toys Tour is the second Featured Tour to be re-activated in Career mode, and all four of its series, in addition to its Reward Showcase, can be played at any time. At the start of each month, Turn 10 will bring an additional Tour to the game. Up next is the Ringer Tour on September 4. This cadence will continue until all of the Tours have returned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tron Catalyst developer Bithell Games has been unable to secure funding for a new project and has laid off the “majority of full time staff”. Mike Bithell took to<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b"> Bluesky</a> to explain the situation and while it’s awful that people have to lose their jobs, at least this boss cares.</p>
<p>“Sad news today, Bithell Games, having been unable to secure a new larger scale project, is reducing in size. This means that eleven jobs are being made redundant. This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff.&nbsp; This constitutes the majority of our full time staff,” reads the post.</p>


<p>“It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages.”</p>
<p>“Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less.”</p>
<p>The layoffs will not affect any existing self-published games and these will continue to receive support.</p>

<p>We have always been fans of Bithell; I recall chatting with him just as his breakout hit, Thomas Was Alone, was released on PS Vita. Since then he has gone from strength to strength, moving from indie titles like Volume to games based on massive franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/john-wick-hex-review/">John Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/tron-catalyst-review/">Tron.</a> He has also has talked to us <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/interview-mike-bithell-on-distilling-the-action-of-john-wick-hex/">numerous tim</a>es, and also came to chat on the much missed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/29/podcast-the-year-according-to-mike-bithell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSA Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>We wish the laid-off staff and those remaining at Bithell Games all the best.</p>
