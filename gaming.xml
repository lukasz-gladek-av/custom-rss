<p>The old "platform expansion", eh?</p>

<figure data-uuid="955cbbc138351"><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/955cbbc138351/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen several ports come our way in the last eight months that would have been nothing more than a pipedream on Switch 1, and it looks like another title that got everyone talking on PS5 back in 2024 might make the jump to the new Nintendo hybrid, too.</p>
<p>We're talking about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, of course, the action-adventure title from Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up. In the developer's latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">financial report</a>, the team discussed what it hopes to see the game achieve in 2026, noting, "We are reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach. This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series".</p>
<p>Now, okay, there's no specific mention of Switch 2 in there, and the platform expansion is merely being <em>reviewed</em> at the moment, but if it's audience reach that Shift Up is after, we struggle to think of a better destination than Nintendo's latest.</p>
<p>"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," the note concludes.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade enjoyed PS5 exclusivity for the best part of a year before the PC version was released in June 2025. With its sequel now in development, it makes sense that the team would want to broaden its reach to attract as big an audience as possible, it just remains to be seen whether Switch 2 or a straight-up Xbox Series port is the way to do it.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more info this year, and will keep you updated with any juicy Switch 2 nuggets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, after a long period of silence following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">final piece of DLC</a> for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, during Sony's first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> of 2026, we finally got a small update as to what <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> has been working on. Along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">a remake of the original trilogy</a>, we learned that the studio had teamed up with <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong> to deliver a 2.5D game featuring Kratos titled <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong>.</p>



<p>There have been a lot of rumours circulating for years about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-is-reportedly-considered-for-a-multiplatform-release-day-one-on-pc-or-something-more/">upcoming 2.5D God of War game</a>, so its arrival was both surprising and not; surprising because after hearing nothing but rumours for a while, it was fair to wonder if it was even going to come out at all, and also not because we'd heard so much about it for so long.</p>



<p>Now that it was confirmed and shadow-dropped at the same time, we're starting to see plenty of reactions to the new 2.5D action game, one of which comes from <strong>David Jaffe</strong>, best known as one of the original creators behind the God of War franchise. To say that he's not fond of this new game would be an understatement.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God of War Creator REVIEWS Sons Of Sparta!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liEszJCMW-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em><strong>This is not God of War</strong></em>," an exasperated Jaffe says in his first of three videos he's now made on the game, the first of which you can see above. "<em>What were they [Sony Santa Monica] thinking, like what the f*** are they thinking?</em>" he continues, as he explains that he doesn't believe the game to be bad overall, calling it "<em>fine</em>," but adds that what he finds offensive in it is how generic the game is, and how he believes this is not the game that God of War fans would have wanted if you were to pitch them the idea of playing a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game in Sony's long-running franchise.</p>



<p>Jaffe adds that he doesn't believe anyone wants to play as "<em>kids</em>" in a God of War video game. "<em>Nobody wants to kids! We don't want to play as Atreus; we don't want a spin-off as Atreus. Why do you guys keep making games about 15-year-old boys? Leave me alone! Go to Epstein's Island or something, whatever the f*** it is, I don't know what they're doing, but leave me the f*** alone! I want to be Kratos motherf*****!"</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God Of War Sons Of Sparta NOT READY for release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClC7rCietLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though his first video can be described as an emotional rant fueled by only playing one hour of the game, in subsequent videos after playing a little more of Sons of Sparta, he digs further into his problems with it, citing issues of "<em>visual noise</em>" and an overall lack of polish, because while some people might call the probelms he's pointing out to be "<em>minor</em>," for him, not including even these 'minor' issues in the first place is "<em>what it means to make a first-party game</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Jaffe believes players wanted something closer to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-summer-2025-release/">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>,</strong> and <strong>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</strong>. A smooth, ultra-violent, 2.5D action game where players don't play as a younger, prequel-era Kratos, but as the Ghost of Sparta he was before he became the Kratos we know from the Norse-era games. He adds that if you were to "<em>pull God of War</em>," as in remove the well-known IP from the game and present it as a 2.5D action game about a young Spartan, people would not be interested in playing it.</p>



<p>He's also butting up against the studio's shift in priorities to be more driven by storytelling, instead of the action gameplay that drove the original trilogy. </p>



<p>"<em>It [Sons of Sparta] reminds me of a conversation I had with someone that is no longer at Sony Santa Monica, when</em> <em>we were talking about the sequence in God of War Ragnarok that a lot of people complain about, which is where Atreus is going on that long sled, walk, whatever, with that girl he likes and it just goes on and on and on. And I said to this person, 'Why didn't they recognize, didn't focus tests tell them that this was boring and they should maybe cut that or truncate it?'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>And they said to me - and this is one person's opinion, but they would know, they were certainly in the know. They said, 'Sony Santa Monica these days is driven mostly, or primarily, by story</em>.' <em>And I'm like, 'Oh my god.'</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IS Jaffe SALTY About God Of War?!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzruHkjMCfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jaffe also claims that anyone who says he is "<em>salty</em>" is wrong and that his only motive for talking about his displeasure with Sons of Sparta begins and ends with him just not liking the game. A statement that is difficult to take on its face, since Jaffe is primarily a content creator now, and all of these videos about his displeasure with the game are fueling what appears to be his main source of income.</p>

The developers say they've identified "a few areas that need further refinement", so taking extra time to work on them is "the right decision".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In case you need a reminder, while <em>Icarus </em>was developed by Rocketwerkz on PC, console development and publishing will be handled by Grip Studios, whose name you might know from its support work on games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09ba0fb1-40df-4991-9f55-2f16878ad8e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>.</p><p>News of the delay of <em>Icarus</em>' console release comes a month or so after Dean Hall and Rocketwerkz announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the game's sales skyrocketed</a> during the most recent Steam winter sale, so we can expect that number to increase further once the console versions arrive.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's an open-world survival game in which you and your friends (or just you, if you're the solitary type) must descend onto a planet on which the terraforming process has gone wrong.</p><p>Once there, you can choose either to play in a sandbox-style open world or to complete individual missions, but either way, you'll be exploring your surroundings, building structures to help you stay alive, and hunting local wildlife for resources.</p>
<p><em>Icarus </em>now launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 26th.

              <p>I know what you were thinking: You were tentatively looking forward to April 3’s <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, but you just weren’t convinced it was going to feature your all-time favorite character, R.O.B. the Robot. Well break out the ticket purchases, because as Nintendo attempts to throw every last scrap of shit at the wall, ol’ Robby’s going to be in there too. A fact that has been leaked by his teensy appearance in a forthcoming tie-in toy set.</p> <p>A whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> merch has been announced just recently, due to go on sale in the first week of April. There’s a six-inch <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-toy-exclusive-reveal/">Yoshi egg complete with chatty Yoshi inside</a>, already <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/fashion-and-dolls/interactive-pets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg/p/254238">up for pre-order in the UK</a> at an eye-watering £60 ($81), alongside <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-deluxe-bowser-castle-playset/p/252460">a Bowser Castle Playset</a> and <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-with-star-launcher-set/p/254896001">star-shaped launchers</a> that kwa-ping characters into your eye.</p>

  <p>But hidden among all these reveals (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-old-spice-and-pillsbury-cookie-leaks-a-deep-cut-super-mario-galaxy-movie-cameo-has-been-revealed-by-toy-packaging/"><em>Total Film</em></a>) appears one certain robot. We found an even clearer image in a YouTube review of the Super Mario Galaxy Movie Jakks Gateway Galaxy Playset:</p>  <p>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) originally appeared as a peripheral toy for the NES in 1985. The character then sporadically popped up as a deep dive in various games, first showing his metal face in&nbsp;<em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em> in 1996, popping up in various&nbsp;<em>WarioWare</em> games, and most notably being a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart DS </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>titles. However, somewhat pertinently, he didn’t make an appearance in <em>Super Mario Galaxy.</em></p>

 <p>R.O.B.’s inclusion does rather lean in to the notion that this&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie is going to be less an epic tale told in the specific video games’ universe, and more another attempt to just cram in as many&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> references as possible for the nostalgic nerds and hope the bright colors keep the kiddies happy. The trailers so far have failed to suggest any form of cogent plot, but rather just bombarding us with nods to familiar aspects of the franchise, with a lot of focus on <em>Super Mario Odyssey.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Switch Emulation Dev Is Fighting Back Against Nintendo’s New Takedowns: ‘We Want To Keep Continuing The Work In The Preservation Of Video Games’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-emulator-eden-nintendo-legal-takedown-2000669430</link>
            <guid>1437331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo’s fired off a new volley of legal notices against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">Switch emulation scene</a>. Close to a dozen GitHub pages were hit with DMCA takedown requests over the weekend. However, while several of the Nintendo Switch GitHub pages have given in to Nintendo’s demands, the development team behind the Eden emulator has boldly refused. Instead, they proceed with publishing a new v0.2.0 build of the Eden Switch emulator on GitHub just days later.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You may remember that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440"><span>back in 2024</span></a><span>, Yuzu and Ryujinx, the two most well-known Switch emulators, were subject to legal takedown notices from Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441">following a massive million dollar settlement</a>. Nintendo’s crackdown on the Switch emulation scene scattered homebrew efforts to various, less easily accessed corners of the internet. But the cat and mouse game has continued over the years, and Nintendo is once again trying to prune back grassroots efforts to reverse-engineer <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">its most popular console ever</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>You could argue that, technically, the majority of these emulators aren’t exactly new, as almost all of them are forks (an offshoot of the existing codebase) of either Yuzu or Ryujinx. In the case of Eden, this is true, as the Nintendo Switch emulator is a fork of Yuzu. In spite of this, Eden’s development team seems relatively un-phased by Nintendo’s latest wave of DMCA notices. The project’s founder isn’t being shy about the team plan to fight back against the company’s latest legal offensive.</span></p>   <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/"><i><span>Wccftech</span></i></a><span>, Eden founder Camille LaVey revealed that they believe the emulator’s GitHub page isn’t breaking any of the website’s hosting policies: “Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we’re never sure of what the future can bring, so we’re always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As of writing, Eden’s GitHub page is still up, even though GitHub clearly states that pages issued with DMCA notices have roughly “1 business day to make requested changes” before being removed. Tied with LaVey’s statement to </span><i><span>Wccftech</span></i><span>, this likely means that the Eden team has issued a counter notice against Nintendo.</span></p>

 <p>Even if Eden’s stand is short-lived, emulation enthusiasts are adamant that Nintendo’s crusade will never be able to completely eradicate Switch emulation from the internet. “If they kill one, 10 more will pop up,” wrote one commenter on the Android emulation subreddit. “Kill 10, 100 more will pop up. They can never kill emulation.”</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has slowly but steadily become one of 2026's open world games to watch out for, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visually-impressive-open-world-fantasy-adventure-crimson-desert-goes-gold-locks-march-launch">with a March release date now locked</a>, lots of people are seriously starting to consider making a trip to Pywel soon. At the same time, veterans might have reservations about jumping in at launch based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a>'s MTX-heavy model.</p>
<p>Of course, large numbers of microtransactions and optional cosmetics are to be expected any time a game's model is free-to-play, and Pearl Abyss' PR and marketing director Will Powers reminded everyone of that during his appearance in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">episode 457 of the Dropped Frames</a> podcast (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/that-is-the-transaction-crimson-desert-wont-have-microtransactions-says-pearl-abyss-because-the-promising-open-world-game-is-a-premium-experience/">GamesRadar</a>): "It's a monetization model: if you do free-to-play, then you need to make up the revenue in a different way." Easy to understand if you've been playing video games in the last 20 years or so, but we all know we often need to make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>You can't blame veterans for thinking even a strictly single-player game like Crimson Desert (which did start off as an online project) could be filled with microtransactions à la Assassin's Creed though. After all, it'd be easy for Pearl Abyss to pull the trigger on those if the game is a massive success, as we know for a fact players typically like putting more money into the experiences they greatly enjoy.</p>
<p>Powers shot such thoughts and comments down quickly: "This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions." Here's where we underline such decisions are above his pay grade and anything could happen post-launch, but it seems that's where Pearl Abyss officially stands right now. If you're picking up Crimson Desert, you're getting a traditional, fully featured open-world adventure with no cosmetics or mounts earned via MTX. "This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Like, full stop."</p><p>That said, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert has three different editions</a> (both digital and physical) up for pre-order at the time of writing, each of which with extra items and cosmetics, so you're definitely missing out on some stuff if you simply pick up the cheaper version. <a href="https://x.com/WillJPowers/status/2023218876105072790?s=20">Powers has acknowledged those</a> on X/Twitter though: "The overall point is that we're not holding back content to sell separately."</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt anyone was fearing Crimson Desert could be short on content, as every piece of footage from the game we've seen suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4euv-AX4E">it's trying to do <em>almost </em>everything</a> the devs came up with during the concept and planning stage. Will it pay off? It won't be long before we find out, as the game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and even Mac on 19th March.</p>

			<p>I play a lot of horror demos during each and every Steam Next Fest, and more often than not, games that I am unaware of make their way into my Wishlist. Crisol: Theater of Idols was a strange case that went the other way as Blumhouse’s latest game looked superb, but the demo emphasised an unkillable stalker enemy that felt at odds with the gunplay and atmosphere of the game. I kind of took my eyes off Crisol after that, but I am very happy to declare that I was wrong to do so. Having now spent the past few days absolutely immersed in the world of Crisol, I consider it to be one of my favourite action horror games in years, and one that feels an absolute steal at its bargain retail price.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crisol: Theater of Idols - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JiJ5g5wc9hM?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story and world-building of Crisol is absolutely superb, and genuinely feels up there with the best of Resident Evil and FromSoft. You begin as Gabriel, a stranded captain on a mysterious shore, entrusted with a mission by the God of the Sun to seal the evil power of the God of the Sea. Gabriel is a devout soldier but one who seems tormented by the conflicting voices of doubt and conviction – conveyed through some fabulous audio design that rewards wearing headphones. Soon after beginning his adventure, Gabriel is confronted by automaton mannequins that seem invulnerable to his pistol and he is swiftly dealt with.</p>


<p>What should be the end, however, proves to just be the beginning as the God of Sun offers his power to Gabriel in the form of a grotesque link between his blood and his weapons. Normal firearms become magical guns when they are absorbed by his magical blood and can hurt the uncanny foes that stalk the streets and buildings of Hispania. It is not just the nature of the weapons that is transformed, though, as the ammunition they fire is manifested from your blood as well. What follows is a unique twist on the conventional risk and reward of survival horror as you must manage your health and ammo from one pool.</p>


<p>Hispania is a darkly beautiful setting, with ruined streets and interiors that defy periodisation as the game could be taking place any time from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century to the current day (the only clear nod to a more modern date being a radio that you use to communicate with friends and sometimes antagonists). The architecture evokes the timeless splendour of Spanish cities, whilst reminding me a lot of the world of Resident Evil 4 – a game that is a clear influence here. Voice acting is mostly very strong – although I will be playing again in Spanish to really set the mood. There have been some complaints about your companion Mediodia being too upbeat for the tone but I quite liked the contrast this enables. Music is excellent and songs can be unlocked by collecting hidden vinyl records in the game.</p>
<p>Your starting pistol is relatively underpowered even when bloodily enhanced but you can level it up as you progress. In the middle of the game it was my primary weapon with a great balance between power and blood cost for ammunition. A shotgun and a rifle are found later in the game and are hugely effective but come at a much higher blood cost. You also have a knife which can be used to parry attacks but has a limited durability to manage. I struggled to time the parry in my playthrough but will practice in future ones – hopefully the window is patched to be a bit more forgiving.</p>

<p>Combat is brutal and visceral as the mannequin enemies are unrelenting in their attacks. Their rigid, inhuman movements are terrifying in the gloom of many areas, and their horrifying appearance is exacerbated by the fact that they keep on coming even when decapitated or dismembered. Managing your ammo and targets when multiple foes are lurching, crawling or even firing ranged weapons at you is truly thrilling in a way that few games manage aside from Leon Kennedy’s best adventures. There is some welcome variety in enemy as the game progresses, with a later crystal/glass foe being particularly difficult to counter.</p>
<p>The aforementioned invincible stalker is far more cohesive in the full game than I found in the early demo. Delores is a twisted mix of robot and statue with a tendency to taunt you as she stomps unerringly towards you. The stealth sections featuring her are not my favourite parts of the game but they were not frequent enough to disrupt my enjoyment and actually offered a great change of pace from the more action-orientated moments.</p>

<p>The final aspect of the game is a focus on puzzles that goes even beyond the influence of Capcom’s legendary series. Aside from finding key items and environmental puzzles involving gears and timed gates, there are regular logic puzzles that range from enjoyable to truly infuriating without ever being too frustrating. Some of these are takes on the familiar but all benefit from fitting the unique aesthetic to perfection. I will admit that one particular late game example involving making up an image from two concentric circles made me pause the game and take a break for a while.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Crisol: Theater of Idols is a unique take on survival horror that has swiftly became one of my favourite games in a long while. It takes classics like Resident Evil 4 and Bioshock and fuses them into a brand new nightmare. The twisting narrative, the mix of gameplay mechanics, and the sheer visceral thrill of the game once it gets its claws into you all combine to make this perhaps my happiest gaming surprise in years. If this glowing review wasn’t enough to convince you, it’s even priced incredibly competitively and puts many far more expensive titles to shame. Crisol truly deserves to become more than just a cult classic and will be in the conversation for horror game of the year, even with some obvious competition on the horizon.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[The ROG Xbox Ally X Price Shoots Up Nearly $200 In Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424</link>
            <guid>1437289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is one of the premier PC gaming handhelds currently on the market. Despite some half-baked UI tweaks and finnicky Windows holdovers, it’s an <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">excellent way to play PC games on the go</a>, for existing Xbox and Game Pass users. The only problem when it launched last fall was the $1,000 price tag. And in Japan at least, that’s just gone up even higher.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/rog-xbox-ally-x-20260216-421609/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Asus has raised the price of the ROG Xbox Ally X in Japan from 139,800 yen tax included ($911)&nbsp; to 169,800 yen tax included ($1,107). That’s a jump of 30,000 yen or almost $200 at the current exchange rate. Notably, the price hasn’t been chanced on Microsoft’s website in Japan, though its listing for the ROG Xbox Ally X then sends users to the Asus page with the new price.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, the base ROG Xbox Ally price has remained the same. That price is still listed at 89,800 yen, or roughly $585. One obvious reason for the discrepancy is that the regular Xbox Ally has 16GB of LPDDR5-6400 memory compared to 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 in the Xbox Ally X. As RAM prices spike amid the ongoing shortage, the Ally X is going to be much more susceptible to the pricing volatility.</p> <p>Asus <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">was one of the first PC gaming manufacturers</a> to tell its partners at the start of 2026 that some prices would be going up as AI “hyperscaler” companies race to acquire available memory supply to build out data centers. At the time, nothing was mentioned specifically about the Xbox Ally X handhelds. While it’s unclear just how many Asus has sold, it promised consumers late last year that it <a href="https://www.asus.com/event/Investor/Content/attachment_en/2025Q3%20IR.pdf">was ramping up production</a> to meet higher demand than originally expected.</p>

 <p>A similar issue is facing every other hardware manufacturer in the gaming space. Valve already delayed announcing the price of the Steam Machine as it evaluates the rapidly changing economic conditions, and its existing Steam Deck, a much cheaper competitor to the Xbox Ally X, has quickly become impossible to buy. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">launch of the PS6</a>, Nintendo is looking at having to hike the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a>, and god help you if your PC is at the end of its life and you need to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">buy or build a new one</a>.</p>

<p>Announced through the official <a href="https://x.com/ArtplayEN/status/2023213425707647237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) account of ArtPlay, their creative director, Shutaro Ida, passed away on February 10, 2026, after a one-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. Shutaro has been a significant figure in the gaming industry, not only in ArtPlay games but also in popular franchises such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. </p>







<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-be-completed-to-shutaro-s-legacy-and-vision">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement be Completed to Shutaro’s Legacy and Vision</h2>



<p>The last project on which ArtPlay’s creative director was working was Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Shutaro was leading this project, and it has now entered its final stages. The development studio has promised to “carry forward his legacy and strive with all our strength to complete this work worthy of his vision and name.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is a 2.5D metroidvania title, set in 16th-century England. It features a gothic atmosphere with strategic battles, crafting, and exploration. The game features a new buddy system for the series, allowing players to play as both Leo and Alex to battle Demon Lord Elias’s reign of terror. </p>



<p>The title also features the series’s largest map yet, with a day-and-night cycle that includes dawn, day, dusk, and night. Players can learn new and powerful abilities as they progress, plus there is also a lot of crafting and cooking, along with customisation that can change the players’ attributes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shutaro Ida has passed away aged 52 after a one-and-a-half year battle against pancreatic cancer. The news was announced by his family via a statement on Ida’s <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account</u></a> on February 15. Longtime colleague Koji Igarashi has vowed to finish the designer and director’s upcoming metroidvania Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement, the sequel to 2019’s Castlevania-infused Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shutaro Ida (sometimes romanized as Shutaro Iida) worked at Konami from 1996 to 2015, mainly as a programmer. His biggest contribution was to the Castlevania series. Starting with the GBA title Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and PS2 game Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, Ida played a key role in bringing the gothic action games into the sixth and seventh console generations, even directing Castlevania: Harmony of Despair on Xbox 360 and PS3. He was also a lead programmer on Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon the invitation of former Castlevania series producer Koji “Iga” Igarashi, Ida joined ArtPlay, the indie dev company Igarashi co-founded. There, Ida designed and directed the crowdfunded game Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, with Igarashi as producer. The game was well-received, and widely seen as a spiritual successor to the Castlevania series. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/25/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review"><u>review</u></a>, we gave it 8.8, noting it “plays and feels almost exactly like the legendary Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting upon two decades of making games with Ida, Igarashi noted in his <a href="https://x.com/KojiIGA/status/2023210325970129391?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tribute:</u></a> “I’ve been working with him ever since Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. It’s not an exaggeration to say that many games hailed as masterpieces would not have succeeded without his contributions. His talent was exceptional.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night’s success was also in a large part down to his incredible support," Igarashi continued. "Looking back, he’s been supporting me for over 20 years. He was the kind of person who always thought about games, tackling game development like he was burning his life away. I hope he can rest peacefully now as he was always running at full throttle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ida’s final game, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is still in development and is due out later this year. Igarashi described it as an invaluable work that Ida poured himself into. “We will take on his aspirations for the game and see that it is properly completed, so as not to disappoint him.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ida last <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2017126464664281512?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> back on January 30, saying that he felt the end was near as he was getting weaker each day. He finished with a simple request: “Please love Bloodstained 2 and all the games I made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> from Ida’s family echoed this sentiment: “Shutaro’s adventures in this world have come to an end, but his creations remain. We would be happy if people could continue to enjoy the games he made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/3X_54wp1xiU?si=XHJYvYoBLUVQIPsl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement YouTube channel</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Posting a screenshot of one such recent request to X / Twitter, Clark wrote: "I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on Cameo. Thank you for liking my shoutouts.

"I think if someone deleted my 100% save file with everything unlocked and every piece of clothing bought, camp completed, map and journal drawings all there, dreamcatchers murals bones exotics and cards, a shout out from Roger Clark might heal the pain," said one fan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">IGN's big interview with Roger Clark on Arthur Morgan and Red Dead Redemption 2</a> to find out just how life-changing the iconic role was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Red Dead Redemption 2 fans recently made progress towards solving the game's newly-discovered spiderweb mystery, and now believe they've reached its final clue following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers"><u>major new discovery within Rockstar's epic cowboy sequel, dubbed the biggest uncovering of hidden content in years</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An intricately-placed breadcrumb trail of spiderwebs was found and plotted, leading to a further set of marked telegraph poles.

A Metroidvania-inspired action platformer from indie retro developer Mega Cat Studios, Sons of Sparta is designed as a prequel to the original God of War trilogy, featuring a young version of Kratos and his brother as they train together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an initial YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> posted after playing an hour of the game, Jaffe made his frustrations with the project's concept clear: essentially, that it was too different in tone from the original trilogy, despite his initial excitment to see a side-scrolling take on the series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the kind of game I've always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War, super into it — but this, to me, is not what I was talking about. I bought this game, it's a $30 game, I don't like it, I don't recommend it," Jaffe began, before turning his attention to the executives at Sony who decided to greenlight the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wanted to make a video more about what are they thinking, like what the f*** were they thinking? It's not a bad game by any means, it's fine, it controls decently... but to me the more fascinating part of this is, why is this in existence? I don't understand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After an hour's worth of play, Jaffe said he couldn't continue with the game as its characters kept "stopping over and over [to] talk and talk." He added: "This is not God of War."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's just make him some generic f***ing kid, like we're watching a Kids WB TV show or something," Jaffe continued on. "It's probably some bulls*** writer going, 'Oh people want to know why, how did people become this way?' No one cares. It's a dumb idea... [Fans] wanted something like Blasphemous, in terms of it's violent, it's bloody, it's serious, it has the tone of the early God of the War games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you pulled God of War out of it, and you just said, 'hey, we're making a game about this kid,' most people would say 'that doesn't sound like a very compelling idea for a video game character,' because it's not."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/god-of-war-creator-reviews-sons-of-sparta-00-00-00-1771243564920.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">David Jaffe.

The only thing offensive about it is its genericism. The only thing offensive about it is its inability to reflect the license, the brand. It's like you get the John Wick license and you make a movie where he's just sitting in a coffee shop talking. Now that might work when you have Keanu Reeves as he's so compelling, and the character's interesting."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jaffe said he had been keen to see a 2.5D God of War game more similar to titles such as Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, Neon Inferno, or Shinobi. "Why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption," he concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every time you make a new game, you don't have to go, 'You know what? Let's not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let's see him as a little kid, some generic boring little f***ing kid.' It's just insulting to the fans. It's insulting to people who worked on the games that they would think this character right here is what people want. It's crap. It's dumb. It's stupid. I would say avoid this f***ing thing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Jaffe had said he wouldn't return to Sons of Sparta, he then went back and played a further three hours, at which point he posted an even more in-depth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClC7rCietLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that critiques the game on a more granular level for more than 30 minutes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Jaffe addressed points around "confusing visual noise during combat," "gameplay breaking visual inconsistencies," a "buggy and confusing user interface," the suggestion that "level design and character motion feels off," and "kiddie level dialogue and poor voice actor performances."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you were watching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">last week's Sony State of Play</a>, you'll have surely seen the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>. Hectic chases through exotic planets, tense moments between the drivers, and… Wait. Hang on. That crash, it looked a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/burnout-paradise-remastered-studio-teases-series-revival">a Burnout crash</a>? Was that real, or some cinematic sleight of hand aimed at getting 2000's arcade racing fans overly eager?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it was the real thing. That trailer, entirely captured in-engine, did in fact show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-creators-of-burnout-are-making-a-crash-mode-spiritual-successor-called-danger-zone">a Burnout-style crash</a> as a small exciting moment in Galactic Racer's campaign mode. This, while obviously being a sweet touch for a ramshackle racing game, is one element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-will-have-podracers">what appears to be narrative-rich rally royale fitting snuggly within Star Wars canon</a>.</p>
<p>"Yes, you might have seen a bit of that!" Kieran Crimmins told Eurogamer, laughing from what appeared to be his home office. Crimmins, as the creative director of Star Wars Galactic Racer, is one of many who formed Fuse Games; a backup car filled with former Criterion developers. These creatives, with a lengthy history working on all manner of racing games including the Burnout series, are bringing their talents to a galaxy far far away.</p>
<p>"Fuse was made with a combination of people who have worked together for a fairly long time, there's things we've loved in Arcade racing - visceral high-octane action and want to bring that to this game," Crimmins explained. "Those sensibilities and some of that DNA from previous games we've worked on, obviously that's in this game because we want to bring that stuff. It's the core of pick-up-and-play arcade racing with great depth, but also great thrill. There's also certain game mechanics that are part of our DNA in there as well."</p><p>Crimmins was joined by one Craig Derrick, a producer at Lucasfilms working alongside Fuse Games on Galactic Racer, eager to speak on the game's authenticity. "I'd jump in to say it's high thrill, but also high risk! The spectacular crashes in Galactic Racer, there's elements of that you see in the Burnout series and other racing games, but also the Pod Racing sequence in Star Wars Episode One!</p>
<p>"The fragility of these vehicles in this game, the scrappiness we're implying in this era… They're really just put together for racing, sort of inherently dangerous to race and in a place where crashes are gonna happen. We want to be able to show that! Cinematically in a fun way, but also lean into the arcade elements while emphasizing this is a dangerous sport you're engaging in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Speedbikes are one of the many vehicles you'll be able to mess around with. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Fuse Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"All the vehicles we have tie into that threat level, as well as the opportunistic choices you can make to win the race. This includes the vehicle you choose, the type of environment you're in, the type of line you're racing in. But yeah, spectacular crashes are going to happen."</p><p>These Burnout-style crashes, while certainly appealing to the Star Wars layperson, also play an integral part of the fantasy according to Derrick and Crimmins. With the Galactic Empire in tatters, people across the Star Wars fiction are having to pull the pieces together and build something meaningful, with some using these pieces to build junkyard vehicles to race vicious across the stars.</p>
<p>"There's a few different things from a play point-of-view," Crimmins said. "Putting our expertise and studio sensibilities into the Star Wars space, it has a rich landscape of vehicle fantasies. Some core pillar racing fantasy, but also as Craig said this used-universe of cobbled together vehicles. All those flavourings are key to that Star Wars vehicle fantasy.</p>
<p>"So while we have our own studio sensibilities, we looked to our partners at Lucas to make sure we translate those into an authentic Star Wars experience. That means having high-octane visceral action with risk / reward mechanics, but also a breadth of experiences you can have in the game. Telling a story, you've got characters and a running storyline that feels like a Star Wars journey you're going on. It's why we've worked so closely with Lucas, so you get that Star Wars magic."</p>
<p>Derrick linked the game very much to this particular era of Star Wars, as well as real world racing history: "For us at Lucas it's all about story, it starts with story. Obviously the film part of Lucas Film is the storytelling part of that, the games part is how you make that interactive. How do you tell an amazing story where you have agency? I think we do that really well, and we're doing that well here. This is ultimately an underdog story and it leans into elements you see in other racing stories, it speaks to the origins of this new league popping up around the end of the Galactic Empire. It's also evocative of this time around the end of World War 2, when all these people had all this machinery. When it was about Hot Rods, testing out jet engines and slamming them in the Salt Flats and trying to race. We have a scrappy group of characters in this that I feel is very exciting.</p><p>"And it's not galactic-wide stakes, it's a local story. There are stakes to each of these characters, they have agendas and reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. But it's less life or death and more win or lose. So it's strongly linked to the competitiveness of the story. The last thing I'll say about authenticity is it's all about aesthetics. It has to look like Star Wars. It has to read familiar as racing in that universe, and it's also the sounds. The music, the engines and these vehicles crunching and hitting each other that's grounded in some authenticity."</p>
<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer is out in 2026 on the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. No specific release date has been announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="347d15142edfd"><a title="Switch and Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/347d15142edfd/switch-and-switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It was back in 2024 that Nintendo really kicked its emulator takedown requests into overdrive following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/switch-emulator-yuzu-to-pay-usd2-4-million-to-nintendo-and-cease-development">removal of Yuzu and 3DS emulator Citra</a>, and a fresh wave came late last week.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/switch_emulators_got_hit_with_dmca_notice/">Reddit</a> user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Devile/">Devile</a>, Nintendo issued a new DMCA notice on Friday calling for the removal of 13 Switch emulators' GitHub pages. Alongside any that still rely on Yuzu, the takedown targeted Citron, Eden, Kenji-NX, MeloNX, Pine, Pomelo, Ryubing, Ryujinx, Skyline, Sudachi, Sumi, and Suyu (the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/creators-of-new-switch-emulator-suyu-hope-to-avoid-nintendos-wrath">formed in Yuzu's wake</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8ghkzxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As with previous takedowns, Nintendo cites the circumvention of its technological protection measures (TPMs) as grounds for removal.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch emulators are primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, these Nintendo Switch emulators illegally circumvent Nintendo’s TPMs and run illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games," the notice reads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are primarily designed to and unlawfully "circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under"the DMCA, and distribution of these emulators constitutes unlawful trafficking in technology that is "primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access" to copyrighted works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, not every emulator outlined is ready to pack up just yet. As noted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/">wccftech</a>, one of the project managers behind Switch emulator Eden took to its dedicated Discord channel on Friday to note, "Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page".</p>
<p>According to the post, Eden seems confident that its emulator source code will remain available, despite the GitHub takedown. "Our development will continue as always," the message concludes.</p>
<p>In a message to wccftech, Eden founder Camille LaVey said, "We want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware". While LaVey didn't specify whether the goal was to keep running the emulator even if the GitHub page was removed, he hoped that "Eden can still be alive for the years to come" if the community stays on board.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Adds Solid Snake to its Operator Roster, New 1v1 LTM, and More Coming in Year 11 Roadmap]]></title>

            <guid>1437244</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the weekend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">Ubisoft</a></strong> hosted the <strong>Rainbow Six Siege Six Invitationals</strong> tournament in Paris, where it also took the opportunity to reveal what players can expect in <strong>Year 11</strong> of Rainbow Six Siege, starting with <strong>Season 1: Operation Silent Hunt</strong>, which arrives on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> and adds an iconic stealth-action hero to its Operators roster: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/">Metal Gear Solid's</a></strong> own <strong>Solid Snake.</strong></p>



<p>The collaboration between <strong>Konami</strong> and Ubisoft means we can finally have two of the video game industry's most well-known stealth icons work together, between Solid Snake and <strong>Splinter Cell's</strong> protagonist, <strong>Sam Fisher</strong>. Which is exactly what Ubisoft showcases in its Solid Snake reveal trailer, with <strong>David Hayter</strong> returning to voice his iconic character, which you can check out below.</p>



<p>As part of his introduction to the roster, Snake and Fisher will team up in a new infiltration mode 4v4 event where they lead a team of operatives to recover stolen data. Snake's iconic Tactical .45 semi-automatic pistol with its integrated suppressor is also joining the weapons arsenal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We're excited to bring the world of Metal Gear Solid series into Rainbow Six Siege with Season 1's new Redacted event, a limited-time 4v4 infiltration mode where Snake and Zero lead a team of elite operators to recover stolen data</em>," said <strong>Joshua Mills</strong>, the recently crowned creative director of Rainbow Six Siege who took over from <strong>Alex Karpazis</strong>, after Karpazis announced he would be moving elsewhere within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>"<em>Players will also discover exclusive skins such as Jackal as Grat Fox and Ash as Meryl, and we're thrilled to have David Hayter lend his iconic voice to Snake's in-game cues. The team also went a step further with 'Last Assignment,' a new mission for Dual Front designed as a special nod to long-time Metal Gear Solid series fans</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of Dual Front, Year 11's Season 1 will be the last season to include Dual Front, with the mode getting removed at the start of Season 2. Season 1 also introduces a new cadence of updates, with the Rainbow Six team now aligning to deliver four balancing updates and two Ranked map rotations per season. </p>



<p>Season 1 also adds a new limited-time mode (LTM) that lets players go one-on-one in a new arcade mode. "<em>This fast-paced duel mode strips Siege down to its fundamentals and offers players the opportunity to challenge friends and random online players alike, or to test their pure mechanical duel skills</em>," Ubisoft writes in a press release.</p>



<p>Looking beyond Season 1, Season 2 will add some Rainbow Six nostalgia for players who remember the series' Vegas era with the arrival of the <strong>Calypso Casino</strong> map, while Season 3 will add a brand-new Defender operator to the roster, and Season 4 is set to introduce a new Social Hub to the game, giving players a space to hang out in-game without trying to shoot at each other.</p>

              <p>When McDonald’s PR tipped me off that there would be an announcement today regarding the fast food chain and a trading card game, I assumed we were being prepared for the announcement of 2026’s annual <em>Pokémon</em> tie-in, when the entire planet <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">loses its collective mind</a> buying Happy Meals just to get the packs of cards. But no, these are literally McDonald’s trading cards, with a set of 24 to collect including the “beloved” Ronald McDonald.</p> <p>It’s set to launch in the UK on March 17, and we’ve chased up to find out when the equivalent is happening in the U.S. <strong>Update: We’ve just found out it won’t be coming to the U.S.!</strong> The cards feature all your favorite McDonald’s characters, like Grimace, and wait what, a sentient stool called “Cheeseburger Chair,” and, oh god, Fry Girl, who appears to be a <em>ball</em> of fries with legs and eyes. This is truly cursed stuff. She’s wearing shoes. Why is she wearing shoes? Apparently this is something to do with a 1972 campaign called Fry Kids, who were originally collectively known as “French Fry Gobblins” and seem to have popped up here and there throughout the decades.</p>

 <p>Other cards glimpsed in photos from this weekend’s London Card Show show the non-sentient Multimixer, which appears to be a milkshake dispenser, and an iconic Milkshape Dip, showing a french fry being dunked into a milkshake. And respect for that. Thankfully neither has eyes or any sense of self-awareness ahead of their being consumed, but good lord, find me the person who’s going to be excited about pulling a card showing a drink distribution system.</p> <p>An enigmatic “trailer” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUtKkY_AYfm/">on Instagram</a> shows a teasing hint of what looks to be a foil reverse of a card featuring the M logo and absolutely nothing else. It declares this to be “A new game from The M Universe,” which is not a reality I’d previously been aware of. We’re also promised that one card will feature Pennywise’s more sinister cousin, Ronald McDonald, which we’re told will “stand out.” This is described as “the return of Ronald McDonald,” and I’ll confess I didn’t know he’d been away. Although perhaps this is some sort of day-release scheme? I imagine the card would cut off before it showed any tags on his ankles.</p>

 <p>I know the wait is going to be unbearable, but the information concludes that “the brand is keeping a few cards close to its chest, with plenty more to come. So, keep your eyes peeled…” I’m not sure why, but that really reads like a threat.</p>

 <p>The reality is, if McDonald’s has any sense and has this be a complete one-off, these cards are going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">be worth a billion-kerjillion bucks</a> in 20 years. Quite how the game aspect of them works is yet to be outlined, but I did read the words “Take it or Flip it game,” and that’s their capitalization. The UK gets to find out next month, and we’ll let you know when Americans can get in on the McD’s TCG action.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 02/16/2026, 10:22 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post to add the information that this is to be a UK-only promotion.</p>

<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It feels like just yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> slashed its way onto the Switch to deliver another one of the series’ action-packed adventures for the ages — and, really, that’s not too far off the mark. The 10th mainline entry in NIS’ seminal RPG franchise made its way westward back in late 2024, which is still plenty recent enough for it to remain fresh in the minds of players and established fans. However, that hasn’t stopped NIS from forging right ahead with the global launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> on Switch 2 just a year and change later.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, this is an expanded re-release of the original Ys X: Nordics with a bevvy of additional quality-of-life features, enhancements, and gameplay scenarios. I’ll cut to the chase: nearly every addition in this enhanced version is a win, all but eliminating common grievances from the base game and tossing in a bunch of new features that make it far and away the definitive way to experience Ys X.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162025/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I’m not sure if anyone who recently dropped a bag of gold on the original will be swayed by what this release has in store.</p>
<p>Just like the base game, Proud Nordics focuses on two leads: recurring series protagonist and fanatical adventurer Adol Christin and Norman warrior princess Karja Balta. Mysterious forces (quite literally) bind this unlikely duo together before an unexpected catastrophe sends the pair scrambling across the Norse-inspired Obelia Gulf to defeat the undead forces of the Griegr.</p>
<p>Gameplay sees you controlling both Adol and Karja to explore the realm, engaging in real-time combat with an array of monsters, and even piloting your very own pirate ship across the sea.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162028/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additions aside, Proud Nordics is as much of a blast to play as the original. The combat is great fun, maintaining a straightforward slash-block-and-dodge system while also letting you simultaneously control both protagonists on the fly to pull off devastating attacks via Duo Mode. The game’s RPG systems are all polished to a fine sheen, with a ton of different ways to customise your stats and movesets for both your protagonists and your ship.</p>
<p>Traversing Obelia Gulf brings me right back to the good old days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, with oodles of treasures, side quests, and hidden lore drops littered across the map. The story bridging everything together is no slouch either — not groundbreaking by any means, but compelling in its own right with plenty of emotional beats further elevated by an excellent English voice dub.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">Mitch reviewed Ys X: Nordics on Switch 1</a>, some of his key issues centred around the tedious nature of sailing, as well as the game’s performance and visual fidelity. I’m happy to report that this updated version takes pretty major strides in addressing both of these areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162027/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Obelia Gulf now features a vast swath of wind currents, which the Sandras can ride to quickly sail between locations. It’s not a perfect fix for those who were frustrated by bouts of sluggish sailing in the original game — many currents must first be unlocked via brief naval skirmishes and there are still plenty of points on the map where you can only rely on your ship’s innate abilities — but this change goes a long way in reducing downtime for map traversal.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more critical to the moment-to-moment gameplay experience, however, is the massive bump in performance and graphical quality that Proud Nordics offers over the original. Back on Switch, Ys X often struggled to hit its 30fps target and the resolution could get pretty fuzzy. The strain on the ageing hardware was obvious, but Proud Nordics on Switch 2 feels like the game has traded in tight working boots for a nice, roomy pair of slippers.</p>
<p>In addition to retouched graphics, it now features options for Quality and Performance modes. Quality Mode bumps up the resolution tremendously while keeping things running at a stable 60fps. However, Performance Mode is the real star of the show here, with a solid resolution of its own and a deliciously smooth 120fps target.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Action RPGs live and die by their game feel, and this refreshed version of Ys X brings a level of responsiveness that makes the simple act of picking up the controller and hitting a few buttons an amazing experience. The only remaining issues I noticed are strictly in the visuals department, as some textures in the game still look rather flat and enemies have an odd penchant for moving at a lower frame rate in handheld mode. All told, these are only minor problems that didn’t impact my overall enjoyment.</p>
<p>Enhancements and quality-of-life features are just half of what Proud Nordics brings to the table. The most substantial addition to the game itself is the newly explorable Öland Island, which brings with it an extra side story, a host of extra dungeons to explore, and a new Mana Action to add to your mystical arsenal.</p>
<p>This large landmass houses previously unrevealed truths about the history of the Norman people while also introducing two new characters, Canute and Astrid, a pair of Shield Brethren with a surprising connection to Karja’s past. The narrative, which sees the game’s heroes in a race with Canute to discover the island’s secrets, may not be a game-changer, but it does a great job of further fleshing out Karja in particular.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162026/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>More parts of Öland Island become accessible as you progress through the main story, encouraging you to come back every so often. Progression also requires use of Mana Hold, a new Mana Action that allows you to pick up select objects and fling them forward for use as platforms or projectiles.</p>
<p>Considering how tactile and fun to use many of the base game’s Mana Actions are, I was disappointed by how finicky Mana Hold is by comparison. Aiming is far more complicated than it should be due to awkward camera angles, and the blocks you launch tend to spin arbitrarily or phase through the environment where you can no longer reach them. Couple these issues with the fact that Mana Hold is essentially locked to exclusive use on Öland Island, and it feels pretty underwhelming.</p>
<p>Beyond the new story scenario on Öland Island, there are a fair few other things to do. Astrid hosts the Coliseum, where you can rematch powerful foes for time-based rewards. Meanwhile, the new postgame dungeon Muspelheim challenges you to battle against ultra-strong enemies and avoid traps to reach the end within a strict time limit. Repeated runs net you rewards that allow you to lessen the dungeon’s difficulty in a variety of ways, injecting the core gameplay loop with a decidedly roguelite flavour.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the breezier side of things, you can also now participate in a couple of new Gullinboard races for performance-based prizes — a major win for those who, like me, could not get enough of the breakneck land surfing action in the main game.</p>
<p>While all of Proud Nordics’ new experiences are certainly welcome additions to the overall Ys X experience and do a particularly effective job at expanding the postgame, I can’t help but feel that a lot of what’s exclusively on offer here feels just a tad superfluous. The new stuff is perfectly good, but Ys X was already crammed so full of things to do both on and off the beaten path that most of what’s added here feels like just another layer of icing on a delicious cake — it’s nice to have, but that bite is going to taste almost the exact same as before.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162029/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyone who already had their fill with the original Nordics may be too full to go back for seconds, and it leaves me wondering whether Proud Nordics would have been better suited as a Switch 2 enhancement patch and further DLC packs for the original game rather than a standalone release.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It may have all the same bones as the original version, but Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 is undoubtedly the way that this landmark action-adventure title deserves to be experienced on Nintendo hardware. Not only are the visuals improved, but the major performance bump makes everything from striking down enemies to simply navigating menus an absolute joy.</p>
<p>The new gameplay additions, ranging from new story scenarios to tough-as-nails dungeon crawling, are nice to have as well, even if they ultimately feel like a small speck awash in the sea of gameplay variety that Ys X already contained. This enhanced version's siren song may be too faint to lure back anyone who forged through the original release, but newcomers and prospective fans owe it to themselves to answer the call and embark on the definitive version of this grand adventure.</p></section>

There's continuous movement through this city, and I've heard about several new shifty characters coming through, and the other guard units have got some new recruits, which means we'll have to work harder to keep up, so chop chop. There's work to do, and rewards to be earned. Traitor's Toll doesn't sleep.</em></p><p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> was our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/2025-techraptor-awards-tabletop-game-of-year" rel="nofollow">Tabletop Game of the Year 2025</a> because of its brilliant semi-cooperative campaign system that really captures the feel of a bustling fantasy city. On release, <em>Guards</em> had a starter set and its first expansion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">Busy Streets,</a> which added extra options and gameplay. Expanding even further on its success, Grey For Now Games has released 2 more expansions, Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes, another miniatures pack, and a hardback rulebook. In this article, we check out all 4 of these new releases to see what they add to your games.</p><p>If you want to know more about <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, the Busy Streets expansion,<em> </em>and how they play, you can check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

  </picture><h2>You Have To Pay The Toll</h2><p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is a fantasy semi-cooperative campaign game set in the city of Traitor's Toll, an independent city blocking a mountain pass that connects 2 Kingdoms. The city built up over time on the riches of the tolls paid by those wishing to use the pass to the point where now, an entire ecosystem supports the collection of those taxes. The Baron oversees all of it, supported by his Lord and Lady sons and daughters, who each control a different element of the city, and the guards they have to enforce it.</p><p>That's where you come in. You are a Guard Captain looking after a shift of guard constables in support of one of Baron's children. Keep the peace, ensure the taxes are collected, and maybe make a bit of extra coin for yourself while you're there.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Hardback Rulebook</h2><p>The new Guards of Traitor's Toll hardback rulebook is an upgraded version of the one from the starter set (or digital download). This one is in a larger format, nearly A4-sized, and in a robust hardback. It contains updated rules, new photos, along with errata and clarifications incorporated into the rules. It also features 32 extra pages, including original design work and 5 short stories set in Traitor's Toll that bring the city to life.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll New Recruits</h2><p>Releasing with the hardback rulebook is the New Recruits expansion, which, unlike the other 2 we cover in this article, contains only miniatures. New Recruits contains a Halfling Guard, a Dwarf Guard, and a Guard with Attack Dog. All 3 miniatures are single-piece resin miniatures that only require sticking to the base, rather than the multipart miniatures found in the Starter Set.</p><p>The stat cards for these miniatures can be either a standard guard recruitment and an appropriate trait card for the halfling and dwarf, from the Starter Set, or the Diminutive Guard card from the Guardhouse Heroes set (which we look at below). The stat card for the guard with attack dog is also in the Starter Set.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>If you want some extra depth in your games, Sinister Citizens includes 5 new major plots with ongoing multicard plots and a new permanent trader with their own plot cards.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Sinister Citizens expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e35e08d6c66583246e67aeb87cee12b19">6 resin figures (Clumsy Apprentice, Little Lost Child, Pale Handsome Stranger, Kai-an the Assassin, Spectral Soldier, and Polly the Pie Maker)</li><li data-list-item-id="e66b7bcdc7311563f35bc738793f95cc7">36 Gaming Cards (1 Rules card, 5 Major Plots, 18 Secrets, and 12 Plots)</li></ul><p>The 5 new major plot cards can be used in the Patrol Duty mission, and once played through, a separate standalone plot card goes into the regular plot that can then come up during other games, and the unique miniature is added to the roster of regular civilians. Polly the Pie Maker doesn't have a major plot, and her plot cards are shuffled straight into the others, and her miniature is added to the table for use when her plot cards come up. The expansion also includes 4 new standalone plot cards and 3 associated secret cards to add some extra variety to games.</p><p>Sinister Citizens is a great expansion, which delivers a lot of playtime across the 5 new major plots and with the addition of extra normal plot cards and a new named NPC. I love the normal plot cards that fit into the game after playing through the major plots, so the story doesn't feel over when they appear again. You also sometimes get random instances where their miniature is on the board, and you can create a tie in narrative for them again in a normally unrelated plot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Guardhouse Heroes</h2><p>The Guardhouse Heroes expansion specifically adds new recruitment options to <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, including named characters, unnamed guard varieties, and new traits and advances.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Guardhouse Heroes expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ee9a5afe525c1453964b29dd78a130cec">4 resin figures (Captain Bellough, Sergeant Krustin, Perricule - Gnome Guard, and Lug - Ogre Guard)</li><li data-list-item-id="e839e64ba08d499079ef5028d23dc97fc">36 Gaming Cards (8 Recruitment, 6 Traits, 1 Plot, 1 Secret, 20 Advances)</li></ul><p>The 4 miniatures in this expansion all come with unique recruitment cards for them. Bellough can inspire a nearby guard to copy their action, the mounted Krustin gets a bonus to seize and subdue if they move 6 inches, and Perricule the gnome and Lug the ogre come on separate stat cards, but have linked abilities with Perricule being able to use Lug's brawn to intimidate, and Lug rushing in to help Perricule if they're attacked.</p><p>The expansion also includes 2 diminutive and 2 oversized recruitment cards, which can be used for other larger/smaller guards, or the halfling and dwarf from the New Recruits set. The 6 new traits offer more unique ways to add flavor to your guards, like zealous and brutish, and the 20 new advances add extra abilities to your force as they develop. My favorite is the Forceful Leader, which lets your captain order a rival guard to make a close or ranged action, which always feels thematic when they shout a command with such conviction that a rival guard simply responds. There is also a new plot card to be shuffled into the deck that gives a unique mission to one of the players.</p><p>Guardhouse Heroes adds a lot of extra depth to your guard forces. The extra advances and traits are especially welcome and help to bring your individual guards to life. The named characters, while a little more expensive, are worth the cost, and if you can afford both Lug and Perricule, they are fun to operate together.</p><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes Final Thoughts?</h2><p>The extra depth that both Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes add to your games of <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> makes them easy purchases. The time to tabletop for the Starter Set does take some investment for learning the rules, then assembling the miniatures and scenery, but both of these expansions include miniatures with limited hobby time required, and the rules fit straight into your existing games. The new Sinister Citizens major plots are fun and rewarding, and the new variation and named guards with Guardhouse Heroes is very welcome.</p><p>The new hardback rulebook is great if you like physical rules and want the extra stories, but the digital rules serve just as well if you play that way, and I like that the New Recruits miniatures weren't forced into a pack, but can be purchased separately if you want to include those in your guard force.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of</em>&nbsp;<strong>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by Grey for Now Games.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-promise-they-wont-force-everybody-to-do-a-face-scan-following-outrage-at-new-age-verification-policy">assured us earlier</a> that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <p>"You will get anywhere between a fairly surgical battle with the more simple moves and synergies, to a downright-drunken-disaster run. [They] act with basically zero understanding of enemy mechanics, no regard for their ability order, and they couldn't give less of a damn about tile hazards." This is a section taken from the description of a mod which turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> into an auto-battler, but turning the controls over to an AI chessmaster. That AI chessmaster just happens to play almost exactly like I have in my seven hours with it thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Seriously, modder Bigbrotherjakeb appears to have found a way to clone me out of sheer desire not to have to play Mewgenics' fights themselves. Their creation, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/8">Auto-Battler Mode</a>', applies the Uncontrollable passive to all of the cats in your party. So, the computer will handle moving them about, targeting enemies, and unleashing abilities. Not that it'll do a good job of any of that. "This is effectively a challenge mode with how dumb the default player AI can be with this implementation (simplest I could quickly find)," the modder wrote.</p>
<p>Cool. Bigbrotherjakeb has hopes of teaching the stupid computer how to pick suitable movement strategies based on the specific class of cat it's controlling in future. I should probably get around to master the same thing.</p>
<p>A couple of other early Mewgenics mods which've caught my eye are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/24?tab=description">Less Cats</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/32">good poop</a>'. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the first one actually results in you having more cats by lowering the number of moggies the game's coterie of weirdos ask for in return for upgrades. As someone who's been a bit sad to part with my retired bois not long after they return from their sole adventure, that sounds good to me.</p><p>Good poop, meanwhile, leaves no room for misinterpretation. Poop now adds two pints to both your cats' health and comfort, rather than dragging it down by the same amount. A relatively small tweak, unless you find a way to play in smellivision further down the road, in which case you might get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the auto-battler mode or less cats a go, both require the Mewgenics Mod Manager dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/1">Mewtator</a>.</p>
<p>Also among the roguelike cat breeder's early mods are a couple which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/29?tab=description">swap around the audio files</a> for in-game meows. This follows criticism directed at the decision of developer Edmund McMillen to include meows voiced by internet personalities such as Ethan and Hila Klein. You can read McMillen's response as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate">our report on the topic</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410</link>
            <guid>1437199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies across tech are freaking out about the worsening memory chip shortage. It’s already delayed pre-orders for <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">Valve’s Steam machine</a> and could torch Sony’s planned rollout for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">upcoming PlayStation 6</a>. The unannounced console was rumored to be arriving in late 2027, but a new report suggests Sony is considering delaying its next hardware generation until 2028 or even 2029.</p> <p>That’s according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, whose latest report on the AI-fueled memory crisis includes two sources familiar with Sony’s “thinking” who claim the console manufacturer is already “considering” pushing its PS6 launch plans back by a year or two. The report claims the delay would have big consequences for the company’s “carefully orchestrated strategy” to transition <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">users from PS5 to the upcoming hardware</a>.</p>

 <p>Alleged specs for the PS6 began <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">leaking last summer</a> and suggested Sony was prioritizing trying to keep its hardware affordable even as it ramps up power in a solo console arms race with ever diminishing returns. Speculation was that more moderate spec improvements could keep the PS6 priced at around <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">$400-to-$600 instead of $700-to-$1,000</a>. Sony is also believed to be currently working on a handheld that would be able to play PS5 and some cross-gen PS6 games, potentially scaling down performance to keep up with higher-end blockbusters.</p> <p>Why would a single component price shock delay an entire console generation? In the past, Sony might have released a much more expensive machine to compensate. But in recent years as the total footprint of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">console gaming market has plateaued</a>, companies have faced pressure to be more aggressive on price to compete with free-to-play ecosystems that are still thriving on old hardware and weaker devices like smartphones. Sony actually ended up winning the recent holiday sales quarter against the newly released Switch 2 in part by slashing the price of PS5 with big Black Friday discounts.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the Switch 2, whether Nintendo will be forced to raise the price of its new console is another big question posed by the memory shortage. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">has previously told investors</a> it has inventory and contracts to help it weather volatility in the first half of 2026, but if conditions persist it will have to re-evaluate its pricing strategy with an eye toward balancing profitability with maximizing install base. Bloomberg’s report reiterated that Nintendo is already “contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 this year.</p>

<p>Pearl Abyss has stated that Crimson Desert’s premium price is “not something for microtransactions.” </p>



<p>Pearl Abyss’s upcoming action-adventure, Crimson Desert, is all set to release next month on March 19, 2026. Ahead of the release, we have heard a lot of information about the title, including the fact that it has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone gold</a>. Now, we have understood the developers’ views on microtransactions. </p>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-doesn-t-have-a-microtransaction-shop">Crimson Desert Doesn’t Have a Microtransaction Shop</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Okami</a>), Crimson Desert PR director Will Power addressed microtransactions. Powers stated that he can definitively say there is no “cosmetic shop.” Powers added, “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world and not something for microtransactions.” The PR director concluded, “this is a premium experience, that is the transaction, full stop.” </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>
<p>You can check out Jaffe's increasingly - erm - impassioned speech in full below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's developer CyberConnect2's 30th birthday, and to celebrate this milestone, the studio has announced <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, a brand new installment in the long-running <em>.hack </em>series over which the company has full control.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/cc2information/status/2023355425437921703" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a social media post</a> (and via an accompanying trailer), <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be "fully self-published by CyberConnect2, from planning to development to release", with usual publisher Bandai Namco granting CyberConnect2 permission to fully manage the project itself.</p><p>According to a newly-revealed <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">official teaser website</a>, <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>will be a "novel RPG experience" that will blend the franchise's "trademark duality of fantasy (game world) and reality (real world) with modern expectations", and not only that, but it'll also feature "100% pure CyberConnect2 spirit".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The new project's music will be composed by legendary Japanese violinist and composer Taro Hakase, whose "dexterous...violin" helped to "kick-start the project", according to CyberConnect2.</p><p>Outside of these details, we don't know too much about <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, but we do know it'll be the first full <em>.hack </em>RPG since 2010's <em>.hack//Link</em>, which was released for the PSP (which should tell you just how long it's been).</p><p>In the interim, a fighting game, <em>.hack//Versus</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hackgu-last-recode-hits-north-america-on-november-3rd" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c65b9d-94a0-406f-9822-3dd79877c7ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a remaster</a> of the <em>.hack//GU </em>trilogy have been released, but <em>.hack </em>fans have been waiting quite some time for the continuation of the core series.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the <em>.hack </em>series, the games revolve around a game-within-a-game known simply as <em>The World</em>. It's not dissimilar to anime and manga properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2cb237f6-edfc-48d7-83cb-b6bc1d2f5bf9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Solo Leveling</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Sword Art Online</em>, although it predates both.</p>
<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
