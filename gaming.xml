		<p>The latest addition to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> library of retro games has arrived, with 2005/6 GameCube game Chibi-Robo! available to subscribers from 21st August, but playable exclusively on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chibi-Robo! - GameCube – Nintendo Classics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjP6uQflzMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Chibi-Robo’s just this little metal chap who wants to make people happy. At just 10cm tall, Chibi-Robo arrives at the Sanderson house and looks to help them find happiness, helping out however he can. That could be clearning up or finding lost items. You’ll run around completing tasks, but Chibi-Robo has a power cord for a tail, which is thankfully compatible with the local electrical sockets and power grid to charge up!</p>
<p>The Switch Online GameCube library now includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</li>
<li>SoulCalibur 2</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo! (from 21st August)</li>
</ul>
<p>With previously teased titles including for future updates including</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Fire Emblem Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Luigi’s Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>Following Chibi-Robo’s GameCube debut, the little robot that could had a handful of sequels and spin-offs on handheld, culminating in the 3DS game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/12/chibi-robo-zip-lash-review/">Chibi-Robo Zip Lash</a> in 2015, developed with Skip in collaboration with Vanpool. Sadly, Skip went defunct in 2020, so while we might see Chibi-Robo return in another adventure in future, it won’t be with the original studio. That said, a number of former devs started Tiny Wonder Studio in 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFFlQ2QdZxA">announcing their first project, koROBO</a> in July of last year, which certainly looks like a spiritual successor to this GameCube original.</p>

			<p>Strauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two Interactive, is once again doing his best to project confidence that Grand Theft Auto VI will not be delayed from its current release date.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC5BVh0IaOg&amp;t=269s">CNBC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>), on the subject of Grand Theft Auto VI hitting its currently stated release date, Zelnick said, "<em>My level of conviction is very, very high, obviously.</em> <em>Rockstar does have a lot of other things going on, but this is of course the primary focus</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Prior to Grand Theft Auto VI getting delayed out of 2025 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar announcing its May 26, 2026 release date</a>, Zelnick did his best on multiple occasions to publicly express confidence in Rockstar hitting its <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-march-2025/">2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. To be fair, there was no specific release date at the time, just a month and a year, meaning that Rockstar could be a little more loose with when exactly GTA VI would arrive. And this game is such a major release that you'd think Rockstar and Take-Two wouldn't call their shot so specifically if they weren't confident they would make it.</p>



<p>But the number of times Zelnick seemed to have a "<em>very high"</em> level of conviction that GTA VI wouldn't miss its 2025 window does make comments like this that much more difficult to believe. </p>



<p>Sure, it's been over a decade since Grand Theft Auto V came out, and while it was being worked on in some capacity in that time, Rockstar has been focusing on <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-development-on-grand-theft-auto-vi-only-began-in-earnest-in-2020/">GTA VI's development "<em>in earnest</em>" since 2020</a>. Zelnick also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-to-2026-was-important-for-allowing-rockstar-to-seek-perfection-says-take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick/">previously called the delay to 2026 "<em>important</em>" </a>to ensure that Rockstar had the chance to "<em>seek perfection</em>" with this release.</p>



<p>But even Zelnick cushioned his comments to CNBC to say that he and Take-Two are trying not to "<em>pump expectations</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We try not to pump expectations. Rockstar's whole stock and trade is to have these extraordinary expectations and still beat them. I know that's their goal. I know it's going to be an amazing game</em>," said Zelnick.</p>



<p>We'll see how things look in six to seven months from now, when we're on the doorstep to its current May 26, 2026, release date. Hopefully by that time we'll have a clear idea if Zelnick was right to express confidence here. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the next GameCube game to join its Switch Online library, and it's none other than much-loved mid-2000s 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Skip Ltd and Nintendo's game will be added to Switch Online next week. It'll be the second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube game</a> to join the service after the Switch 2's launch, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Strikers</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, it was released in Japan in 2005, but it didn't get a Western release until the following year (as was fairly common for Japanese releases back then). You play as the titular Chibi-Robo, an adorable robot performing household tasks and aiming to become the best Chibi-Robo in the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=2hAUs9Cp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chibi-robo-nintendo-switch-online-platforming.jpg?itok=HMk9-5_- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be joining the Nintendo Switch Online library next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay consists of exploring the Sanderson house, finding collectibles, and cleaning up messes as you go. You'll also need to keep an eye on your battery levels, which are essentially your health bar; failing to charge yourself up on a regular basis will result in the loss of half of your accumulated currency.</p>

<p>Since the release of the original game,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>has spawned several sequels, with the latest being 2015's 3DS exclusive&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em>. Incidentally, that game, along with its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder</em>, is currently unavailable on any modern system.</p>

<p>It's one of several GameCube games to be available as part of a Switch Online membership on Switch 2, joining the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, among others. You'll need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it, though.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online 2 right here.</p>




<p><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2 players (but not original Switch players) on August 21st, so keep an eye out for it if you're a member.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-door-is-an-ai-storytelling-game-that-actually-makes-sense.1269051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Years before ChatGPT jump-started the generative AI wave, OpenAI technology powered a game called <em>AI Dungeon 2</em> that essentially let you improvise an open-ended, anything-goes story with an AI narrator. Hidden Door, a new platform that’s now in early access, also lets you cowrite a choose-your-own-adventure-style story with AI. But this narrator won’t let you do whatever you want — in fact, that’s a lot of the appeal.</p><p>Hidden Door is designed to let you play in worlds that include the public domain settings of the <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as well as <em>The Crow</em>, which Hidden Door has licensed. You create a character, fill in a few details about their backstory, and write in notable traits. The system gives you an opening scenario, and you respond, similar to a tabletop player with a game master. For some decisions, a behind-the-scenes dice roll will decide whether you succeed or fail; either way, the story proceeds from there.</p><p>I was given access ahead of Wednesday’s announcement, and for one story, I chose a variation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> called “Courtship and Crimson,” which means there are vampires. I told Hidden Door that I was a vampire hunter that’s driven by “an uncompromising sense of duty and a thirst for vengeance,” and the game threw me into a social event where I immediately spotted what I thought was a vampire. There were some prepopulated options, but I wrote my own — to immediately attack the potential enemy with a weapon — and the game let me do so. (It turns out the “vampire” was an illusion!)</p><p>While playing, you’ll collect cards with things like characters and locations that you can look back on as a refresher for key parts of your story. The narrator also has a deck of cards with plot points you can occasionally pick from to guide where you want the story to go.</p><p>Where Hidden Door differs from a general-purpose chatbot is that it will create in-universe limits on what you write. With ChatGPT, for example, I asked it to create its own version of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and vampires. Then, I wrote that I had a magical, unbeatable bow with silver arrows. ChatGPT let me generate it without any hesitation and let me use it to quickly defeat every vampire on Earth and eventually the galaxy. It’s not precisely “unrealistic” (since vampires aren’t real), but it short-circuited any kind of challenge or satisfying narrative. With Hidden Door, when I tried to pull a similar trick, the game stopped me and gently encouraged me to try and strike up a conversation to gather information instead.</p><p>Sometimes it felt like Hidden Door was simply limiting my options, though. In a <em>Wizard of Oz</em> instance, I tried to make the “daring,” “danger addict” reporter that I was playing get in an apparently hypnotized porter’s face, sending repeated instructions to throw a punch or grab them. The game gave me a “you failed” message. It might have been pure (and unusual) bad luck on dice rolls. But even when things go well, I feel like I can sense the strings pulling the stories in a specific direction instead of letting me spend too long with random characters.</p><p>It would be one thing if this resulted in a genuinely great narrative, but the storytelling can feel disjointed. So far in my testing, each story feels like a series of sometimes entertaining beats guided firmly by the AI narrator behind the scenes. In one scene in my vampire story, an orchestra conductor continued feeding me information to set up a mysterious plot thread — even as I had my character pay basically no attention to him and instead focus on stabbing and killing a vampire version Lady Catherine. In a live tabletop game, there’s also the added camaraderie of bullshitting with your friends; going back and forth with an AI just isn’t the same.</p><p>The game has some rough edges. The narrator’s thinking can take a long time, often many seconds, and while waiting for something to happen, I would often get distracted and click away from the tab. A few times in my vampire story, the game also seemingly copied and pasted an extensive description of my sibling into the text, including an errant misplaced period.</p><p>Still, a focus on familiar narrative worlds could make Hidden Door a compelling way for some people to interact with an AI storyteller. Unlike rolling your own story with a chatbot from a big AI company, Hidden Door doesn’t let you just break all the rules to instantly win, so you have to work within the logic of each story as you’re playing (even if that logic involves vampires or the magical world of Oz). And the platform’s usage of public domain and licensed works means (theoretically) that the stories you’re playing through aren’t violating any sort of copyright infringement. Hidden Door <a href="https://www.hiddendoor.co/help/faq">says</a>, “Most authors we work with are deeply involved in the creation process.”</p><p>The best thing that I can say about Hidden Door? Even though I have my problems with that vampire hunter story, I’m intrigued about what happens next.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/757816/hidden-door-early-access-ai-story]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To me, the best part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is getting really into the idea of pretending you're living in 1900s Sicily and drinking in the gorgeous vistas that the game's world offers up like sips of wine. You can imagine, then, how keen I was to give its new first-person driving mod a go.</p>
<p>Having already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">knife-fought my way through the main story</a>, I thought this sounded like a pleasant change of perspective to take in when motoring around the Valle Dorata, hoovering up the last of those Explore Mode collectibles. I wasn't wrong either, the mod's great. Well, when it's not accidentally showing you the back of Enzo's teeth and eye sockets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mafiatheoldcountry/mods/24?tab=description">First Person Driving Camera</a> by Norskpl is wonderful when you're just merrily trundling along in the likes of the Bolt Model 1 or Dufort Camionette. However, if you switch to the likes of the Ekhart Speciale or one of the Carozella variants, you'll start to see a bit of Enzo's face clipping into view when you brake hard or hit a bump. It's not too bad in those, if obviously something that shatters your illusion of living in old school Italy when it does happen.</p>
<p>Then, I hopped into the Delizia Type 86, and was permanently treated to two floating gristle orbs that I'm sure look like eyes from the other direction. That's in addition to the view your dentist might get if they checked your teeth by climbing inside your mouth, slipping their body down your throat, then turning around to gaze up your gullet (is it just me they do this to?). I even had extra wrinkles in the form of floating facial hair from the beard I'd equipped, and the brim of my hat dipping into view. You can get rid of those last two by switching back to being clean shaven and hatless, but the first two issues persist.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Norskpl is aware of this stuff, and sadly it seems they may well be powerless to prevent it, unless they're able to draft in help from another modding whiz with a handy solution. "That’s the reason why game devs deleted this feature," they wrote in the mod's comments section. "Game characters use animations during driving which are causing this sort of thing. I don’t know if there’s any way to fix it."</p><p>That's a shame, but as I say, if your aim is just to use this mod to go cruising around, I reckon you should still give it a try. That's especially true if you're happy with one of the slower cars, like the ones I tried first, as you'll have ample opportunity to take in the sights - and the cars' interiors. The latter are surprisingly detailed and nice to look at up close, given this angle didn't make it into the base game. Hopping in something faster (like the Carozella) comes with a higher clipping risk, but it's worth trying at least once, just to experience the wonderful sensation of raw speed you get trying to thread The Old Country's vintage racers through narrow city streets or country tracks at top speed.</p>
<p>The mod is also about as easy to install as you'll get. All you need to do is extract some files, and stick them where the description says to in your game files. As far as manual installation goes, there's precious little with as this minimal room for stuff to go wrong, unless you go out of your way to muck something up.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-secret-to-grounded-2%E2%80%98s-development-is-a-great-sign-for-xbox-fans.1269036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Grounded 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007">arrived in Early Access</a> just three years after the first game hit 1.0. The surprise sequel caught many fans off-guard. Why make a new game instead of just updating the older one? <a href="https://kotaku.com/obsidian-grounded-avowed-outer-worlds-game-pass-xbox-1851760964">And how did Obsidian Entertainment</a> develop <em>Grounded</em> 2 so quickly, launching its Early Access version the same year it will have shipped two massive RPGs in <em>Avowed</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>? The answer has a lot to do with <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> maker Eidos Montreal.</p> <p>The veteran AAA studio isn’t just a co-developer on<em> Grounded 2</em>, it turns out. “The majority of the heavy lifting is done in Eidos Montreal,” Obsidian game director Chris Parker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/grounded-2-developer-interview-obsidian-entertainment-eidos-montreal/">recently told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “We have a core group of people here [at Obsidian], primarily the folks that worked on <em>Grounded</em>, of course. And then there’s folks like me, acting as game director, who are working day in and day out with Eidos. The artists and designers and engineers, the vast majority are at Eidos Montreal.”</p> <p>That’s not to say that both teams didn’t work closely together. There was constant cross collaboration according to Eidos creative director Justin Vazquez, including big build reviews every few months and alignment on the sequel’s emphasis on narrative and Early Access scope. “<em>Grounded</em> is Obsidian’s IP,” he told <em>Polygon</em>. “It’s their baby, and we are here to work with them to help grow the franchise together. The point isn’t for us to grab it and just run wild with it, so we collaborate on everything on the highest level of ideas and the lowest level. There isn’t anything that isn’t being touched by both studios to ensure that we are delivering the best experience for our players on&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>.”</p>

 <p>As for why make <em>Grounded 2</em> in the first place, both developers pointed to technical limitations of the Xbox One and the desire to push the ambitiousness of the series following the success of <em>Grounded 1</em>. It’s also clear that, while currently much smaller than the previous game, which hit version 1.4 last year, <em>Grounded 2</em> is a lot more streamlined and approachable. The rough edges have really been sanded down without sacrificing much in the way of RPG crafting depth. It also just looks a lot more detailed and vibrant visually. <em>Grounded 2</em> has already <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194">hit 3 million players</a> across Xbox and PC (it’s available through Game Pass on both).</p> <p>All of that suggests that Microsoft’s gambit of having Obsidian essentially outsource much of the sequel to an outside studio has paid off. It helps that <em>Grounded</em> was made with Unreal Engine rather than a set of in-house proprietary tools. Does this mean that Microsoft can find partnerships to help speed up development of its other franchises as well. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">revealed last year</a> that <em>Halo</em> would also be moving to UE5, with more information on the future of that series <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">coming in October</a>. With<a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/bethesda-is-allegedly-working-on-multiple-fallout-games-including-fallout-3-remastered-teases-report/"> rumors also circulating</a> of possibly multiple new <em>Fallout</em> games in development as well, what are the odds that Obsidian or Bethesda could work with an outside studio on one of them next? After Bethesda successfully <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">partnered with Virtuos on the UE5 <em>Oblivion</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>, a similar eventual update to<em> Fallout 3</em> seems all but inevitable.</p> <p>These efforts don’t always bear fruit. Microsoft also <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">canceled <em>Perfect Dark</em> this year</a>, which was a collaboration between the smaller first-party team at the now defunct Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. But the pipeline that delivered <em>Grounded 2</em>, at least the Early Access version of it, seems like one that could potentially limit <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-releases-delays-2023-botw2-starfield-suicide-squad-1849840981">some of the ever-lengthening lead times</a> between new games in the increasing number of Microsoft exclusive-franchises that have resulted from industry consolidation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-doubles-down-on-claim-that-former-subnautica-2-executives-%E2%80%9Cabandoned%E2%80%9D-the-game.1269030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Krafton isn’t backing down from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-says-former-subnautica-2-leadership-abandoned-their-responsibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims that former executives</a> at Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds had “abandoned” the game before their dismissal from the studio.</p>



<p>In an official response to the lawsuit filed against it by the studio’s founders, Krafton said that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire <strong>“abandoned their roles as studio-wide Game Director and Technical Director to focus on their personal passion projects and quit making games for Unknown Worlds entirely.”</strong> As far as former CEO Ted Gill, Krafton says that he was <strong>“focused on leveraging his operational control to maximize the earnout payment, rather than developing a successful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Krafton’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response continues</a> to allege that in July 2023, staff at Unknown Worlds, specifically Subnautica 2’s development director, had suggested that both Cleveland and McGuire were “checked out” and that they were confused about it. With both studio heads not around, Krafton says that it led to the game’s multiplayer delays from it’s original Q1 2024 release date.</p>



<p>By Spring 2025, the publisher says, the development team received “extensive feedback” from the internal teams which believed that Subnautica 2 wasn’t ready for a release into Early Access. Even Krafton’s CEO reportedly warned the studio heads that a <strong>“premature Early Access release of a highly anticipated sequel like Subnautica could cause irreversible harm to the entire IP franchise—pointing to the sequel to Kerbal Space Program as a prime example.”</strong> </p>



<p>Despite that, they say, the executives attempted to push forward the Early Access release of the game in order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-wanted-to-delay-subnautica-2-to-avoid-250m-payout-lawsuit-claims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to hit the earnout</a>. That’s even with comments made that at the rate of current development, the game would <strong>“be in development for 30 years”</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>“Krafton, fearing how an underbaked EA Subnautica 2 would be received by both existing fans and the broader market, urged Cleveland and McGuire to return to their posts to generate a market-ready product that would not disappoint fans,” </strong>the document reads. <strong>“Cleveland and McGuire declined. In response to Krafton’s request for the Key Employees to return to lead the development of Subnautica 2, Gill stated that ‘[t]here’s no coming back to a job they didn’t have.'”</strong></p>



<p>It was also said that Cleveland and McGuire claimed they would self-publish Subnautica 2 without the support of the publisher, and began secretly downloading <strong>“massive amounts of confidential information from Unknown Worlds”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“The Key Employees’ insistence on releasing the game immediately was singularly driven by self-interest in obtaining the earnout,” </strong>Krafton says. <strong>“At every turn during development, the Key Employees were laser focused on avoiding ‘a timeline that doesn’t tank the earnout opportunity’ and scheduling the release to maximize their payments.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Conversations throughout the post-acquisition period make clear the Key Employee’s [sic] focus was on their payday, and not on the game. As early as 2022, an employee who was due to receive a portion of the earnout stated that despite the significant delays in the game, he was confident ‘Ted [Gill] will&nbsp;concoct a scheme to get us that earnout.'”</strong></p>



<p>There’s plenty more in the response, which you can read for <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">yourself via Scribd</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows Gives Players Two Unique Ways to Play.</p>
      </div>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows does have a Historical Codex that provides a wealth of content to read through, but it doesn't quite compare to how Discovery Tour allows you to explore the game's world and learn more about the history of that specific era. If you're unfamiliar with it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-is-a-smart-/1100-6456747/">Discovery Tour was an optional mode introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, with Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Assassin's Creed Valhalla also receiving the mode as post-launch content.</p><p>The mode stripped out all combat from the Assassin's Creed games, giving you free rein to wander around at your leisure or engage in a guided tour. For example, Assassin's Creed Odyssey had dozens of guided tours covering themes like ancient Greek art and philosophy, while Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Viking Age mode had players assume the roles of various characters and take on quests that were designed to educate them about life in Norway and Anglo-Saxon England.</p><p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows won't be offering any post-launch history lessons, fans can look forward to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/">new expansion when it arrives next month</a>. Ubisoft also spoke about how it is planning to dig deep into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-devs-say-that-the-assassin-templar-war-is-just-getting-started/1100-6533895/">secret war between Templars and Assassins</a>, and it looks like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exec-teases-new-versions-amid-switch-2-rumors/1100-6533378/">live-action Netflix series adaptation</a> is starting to gather momentum.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced that Chibi-Robo will be the latest GameCube game to come to the Nintendo Switch 2's classic library as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p dir="ltr">The rare and expensive title will be added to Switch Online's GameCube library on Thursday, August 21, 2025, bringing the collection to five games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjP6uQflzMU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BjP6uQflzMU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Originally released in 2006 in North America, Chibi-Robo is a platform-adventure game where you play as the titular diminutive hero tasked with helping out the Sanderson household. As you complete tasks, you gain "Happy Points" in your goal to become the top-ranked "Super Chibi-Robo" in the world. But over time, you will also be helping out the Sanderson family tackle their own personal problems.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Chibi-Robo only achieved modest sales when originally released, it's become a rare cult classic that had never previously been re-released, while the copies of the game often fetch high prices. In our original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chibi-robo-review/1900-6143731/">review</a>, we said, "Despite the monotonous and occasionally tiresome gameplay, the great cast of characters and offbeat sense of humor manage to make Chibi-Robo a compelling and ultimately enjoyable experience."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the only home console release for the series, with subsequent instalments, such as Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash, developed for the Nintendo DS and 3DS respectively. The latter was considered a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/10/chibi-robo_zip_lash_fails_to_clean_up_in_japanese_charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial failure</a>, including even in Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has previously confirmed that other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube classics</a> like Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and Pokemon Colosseum will be added to the Switch Online service in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Other perks from the Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriptions have included Switch 2 edition upgrades, although this has so far been limited to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for those who own the original games on Switch 1.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 fans are sharing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">plenty of feedback</a>--both good and bad--following the game's first open-beta weekend, and one recurring theme has seen players requesting a BF6 server browser with persistent servers. Producer David Sirland has responded to fans on social media, explaining exactly why DICE <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/" data-ref-id="1100-6533674">only has a server brower for Portal mode</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954285077946396736" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to a player asking for a way to matchmake with larger groups of players, without having to rejoin after every game, Sirland said that the Portal server browser "is basically enabling that." While Portal's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">main selling points are user-created game modes</a> and custom experiences, Sirland says that the mode still fulfills the main function of a server browser, even if players may have to filter out the verified servers from the custom experiences.</p>

<p>"The combination of the pool of the persistent servers and the spun-up ones is not very useful," Sirland explains. "Matchmaking servers spin up in seconds (get filled with players), and spin down after game is over. That couple of seconds plus when servers lose a lot of players mid-game is the only time you can join, which makes it a tricky combination (and full of queuing to join issues)."</p><p>"We think the current setup gives us the best of both worlds, as you can choose to go spin up a server through regular matchmaking, or find an existing server that is already running, or create your own as well," Sirland says of the decision to limit the server browser to Portal mode. He adds that DICE will be testing the browser soon, allowing players to check out the new system for themselves.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954655278453981222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another reply</a>, Sirland explains the lack of persistent servers in standard matchmaking, explaining that the current system allows for a lot more flexibility between maps and game modes--which means shorter waits for matchmaking.</p><p>"That is to allow for playlists of varying size (max players) and modes," Sirland says. "For example, you can play the 'Yellow maps' playlist that contains Siege of Cairo and Iberian Offensive (any mode). Then let's say I picked the playlist called 'Domination Bonanza,' which includes all three open-beta maps. We can play together when our respective playlists overlap. As in when your "yellow map" plays Domination, for example. That way we pack servers much more effectively and can allow for more modes and max sizes to coexist in the same playlists.</p><p>"Stuff like Rush, that for some maps play 48 players, for others 32 players, and for some 64 players, we want to be able to put in playlists too," Sirland continues. "This is not possible in the old system of persistent servers as the max-players count is locked (or we'd have to kick players, for example)."</p><p>Sirland hasn't specified when players will be able to test the Portal browser for themselves, but the next round of the BF6 open beta is due to kick off very soon on August 14. To check out the second leg of the beta for yourself, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown</a> has all the info you need to get started.</p>

The system prioritizes ping and "time-to-game" ahead of most everything else, including skill, Sirland said.</p>

<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“[Football Manager 26] promises to propel players on an adventure to shape their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience to date,”</strong> Sports Interactive said. <strong>“All the story-making potential is redefined as players get ever closer to the heart of the beautiful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager’s move to Unity has been a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-documented journey</a> that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple delays</a> of Football Manager 25 only for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game to be canceled</a> altogether.</p>

One of the issues in the crosshairs is the reported "super bullet" causing unexpectedly fast time-to-kill rates.</p><p>BF6's principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took to X</a> following the end of the open beta to ask players for videos of "suspected super bullet/unexpectedly fast TTD" bugs. A number of players have reported having this issue in the Battlefield beta, with some streamers even experiencing the issue live on stream. The unusually quick TTD (time to death or time to down) bug causes some players to be downed in just a few shots, and sometimes even when behind cover.</p>

<p>Players were quick to provide examples of the suspected bug, with some speculating that the server was slow to apply damage that had already been received, causing the full amount of damage to be applied to the player all at once after a short delay. Players have also reported taking damage or failing to heal when they should be at full health, including immediately after respawning--though this bug appears to only impact the health-bar UI and not players' actual hit points.</p><p>While some player's TTD issues were put down to regular lag due to a poor internet connection, others have shared videos of the suspected bug in question. Le Bihan later updated to thank players for sharing their footage, saying he's now been sent "a bunch of good videos" to investigate the issue.</p><p>With the first open-beta weekend concluded, players have taken to social media to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">share their thoughts on the preview</a>, both good and bad.

            <p>After delaying and then cancelling Football Manager 2025 due to ongoing issues getting the massively reworked game ready, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced that Football Manager 2026 is coming.</p>
<p>Details on the game are sparse, with no new details beyond the fact that we know Sports Interactive planned for FM25 to be a huge evolution of the series which had seen more iterative changes and improvements over the years prior.</p>
<p>According to SEGA FM26 will "take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>
<p>The move to the Unity game engine should bring the 3D match engine up to modern standards. While the teaser released by Sports Interactive doesn't show an actual match in action, it does tease some in-engine visuals and points to the official Premier League licence.</p>
<p>You can watch that small teaser trailer below:</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-stock-spike-thanks-to-battlefield-6-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-stock-spiked-thanks-to-the-battlefield-6-beta.1268943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first weekend of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> Beta can surely be deemed a success. Its concurrent player count on Steam was in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands off the jump, immediately surpassing Battlefield 2042</a>. It then continued to rise to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">nearly half a million players, again, on Steam alone</a>, and it eventually did pass half a million, even beating the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">highest concurrent player count of Call of Duty on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>On that kind of popularity alone, it was a successful weekend. Adding the fact that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mky5ll/unpopular_opinion_battlefield_6_is_better_than/">community seems to be on board with Battlefield 6</a> makes it an even bigger success. But it was also immediately successful in helping out Electronic Arts as a whole.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-beta-pushes-eas-stock-to-all-time-high">MP1st</a>, the Battlefield 6 beta helped spike EA's stocks, with share prices rising <strong>4.7%</strong>, it's largest increase since the end of last month. EA shares were trading at <strong>$176.11</strong> a share thanks to this rise, giving EA an estimated $42 billion evaluation.</p>



<p>It's alltogether a strong start for the series return and its attempt to bring back what used to be an annual bout between Call of Duty and Battlefield, where both sides had nearly equal footing in the shooter space as both series tried capturing players attention. It's unfortunately been a one-sided fight in recent years, with Battlefield barely able to hold a candle to the kinds of numbers Call of Duty is capable of. </p>



<p>This is the first time in what feels like a long time that Battlefield has the chance to take back its slice of the pie that Call of Duty had subsumed. We'll see how this next beta weekend goes, which at the time of this writing is due to start tomorrow, August 14, and run until Sunday, August 17. After that, it'll be a long stretch to October when the game is set to launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Battlefield 6 is able to stick the landing, and carry this momentum all the way to a strong launch and an even stronger first year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fae Farm Updates and Online Services to End in September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-updates-and-online-services-to-end-in-september.1268940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates will be coming to an end in September, and that the game's online servers will be shutting down at the same time.</p>

<p>In an update on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, the studio says the game "will be going offline" on September 10th at 11:59pm Pacific (or around 2am the following day by Eastern time), and that there won't be any further updates for the game after that.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s updates and online services will be coming to a close, Phoenix Labs has assured fans that the single-player offline version of the game will remain playable, so if you do own&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and you're yet to get around to checking it out, you haven't missed your chance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=Cm2kwdHq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=bfK8-fcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending next month.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't seem as though the game is being delisted, either, so you should still be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>The end of&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates comes after Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a> earlier this year, a move the studio referred to as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations" at the time.</p>

<p>That decision followed the release of an update for monster-hunting RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>by the name of Awakening, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">proved hugely unpopular with players</a> and caused the game's player base to dwindle. The failure of Awakening also led Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">shut down <i>Dauntless&nbsp;</i>in May</a>.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>has closed down and that updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending, it's not too difficult to extrapolate that Phoenix Labs itself might be about to close down. It certainly wouldn't be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">only studio</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">do so this year</a>, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Gamescom 2025 is right around the corner, so expect a huge surge of reveals and details on some of the biggest upcoming games. If you want to know exactly what to expect, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>With E3 dead and gone, Gamescom is the ultimate annual event for gaming fans to soak up the latest news and get their hands on huge titles ahead of launch, and 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year.</p>



<p>From the biggest AAA titles to indie games to keep an eye out for, we’ve highlighted everything announced for Gamescom 2025 in this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Opening Night Live will showcase huge games. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Games set to headline Gamescom 2025 include Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hollow Knight: Silksong, EA FC 26, and lots more—with surprises also set to feature.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a> will be stacked full of trailers, first-look exclusives, gameplay showcases, and special guests. This includes the reveal for <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-happening-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a></strong>, the opening cinematic from <strong><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1954528805269221431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, </strong>and gameplay from <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>.</strong></p>



<p>With over 1500 exhibitors at the event, there is no shortage of things to look out for, though perhaps the most in-demand will be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable demo of <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Both Microsoft and Nintendo have announced playable demos on their hardware, the former including the new ROG Ally.</p>



<p>Konami announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both <strong>Silent Hill F </strong>and <strong>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater </strong>will be at Gamescom</a>, while other partners in attendance include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-first-wave-of-partners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft and Capcom</a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-returns-to-gamescom-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its attendance</a>, having skipped Gamescom in 2025, with the Switch 2 set to be a highlight.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>EA FC 26 </strong>is among the titles that will be playable at Gamescom, with EA Sports ramping up marketing ahead of the worldwide release in September.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Drag x Drive Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/drag-x-drive-review.1268925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re one of the Nintendo fans who worried the company lost its creative spark after playing it fairly safe with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>, let me introduce you to Drag x Drive: a wheelchair basketball-inspired sports game that’s controlled almost entirely with the Joy-Con 2’s mouse mode. True, it’s surprisingly drab in personality considering it comes from the company that’s brought us some of the most iconic characters and worlds in gaming, but even after 20 years of playing every bizarre motion-controlled game from the Wii on down, I can safely say this is something I’ve never seen before. Perhaps more surprising to hear, I actually really like how Drag x Drive plays. I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the look of it, the main reason this game exists is to showcase the Joy-Con 2’s combination of built-in mouse and motion controls. The separated left and right controllers direct your baller’s left and right arm, respectively; you can slide the controller on a flat surface to have your arm push your wheels forward and backward, lift and flick your wrist after you line yourself up with the hoop to shoot the ball, and wave to a teammate to signal that you’re open for a pass. Drag x Drive plays like a more hardcore version of a game in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/14/wii-sports-review">Wii Sports</a> series: it’s less pick-up-and-play, with more advanced techniques to master and the added demand of constantly sliding your controllers around. If you hate Wii-era motion controls or any game that leaves your arms and wrists a little bit tired after extended play sessions, you should probably stay far away from this one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Drag X Drive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first hour or so, it didn’t feel natural. It demands a lot of actions a game has never asked of me before: usually games like Wii Sports rely on simple controls paired with automatic movement, but Drag x Drive puts you in complete control of your character, and I just wasn’t used to it. And when things weren’t going well, like when my opponent kept scoring and I hadn’t yet learned how to stop it, the physicality of it all made for a steeper, more frustrating learning curve than just remembering which buttons to press on a traditional controller (an option that is entirely absent here).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as I practiced further, I started to really enjoy the way Drag x Drive plays. Once I absorbed the idea, I started comfortably gliding around the lone arena that combines a traditional basketball court with skate park elements, stealing the ball from opponents and then dunking it after doing a flip off a halfpipe. Drag x Drive’s skill ceiling feels surprisingly high, and I can see a hardcore group really latching onto its systems. The mid-match action is very polished as well, with rock-solid performance and cool haptic feedback where you can feel the click of your wheels in the controllers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s generally very responsive, if<em> </em>you have a proper surface to play on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s generally very responsive, too, <em>if </em>you have a proper surface to play on. That’s a big “if” – never before have I had to undergo so many wardrobe changes to figure out which pants were ideal to wear when playing a video game. Nintendo says you can use your legs for the mouse controls, but the results really varied depending on if I was wearing jeans, pajama bottoms, cotton sweatpants, or athletic shorts, which ended up working the best. Any texture, wrinkles, or folds impacted motion accuracy, and if I wasn’t sitting with my legs perfectly flat like a tabletop, it sometimes wouldn’t register that I was trying to move at all. It takes some work to achieve the best position to play, but once I found it, the controls did work significantly better than I expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have the option, though, don’t use your lap. Drag x Drive easily worked the best when playing in my office on my desktop PC monitor, which is where I settled after finding that leaning over a living room coffee table wasn’t comfortable enough either. I simply moved my keyboard aside and had the entire flat surface of my desk to slam the Joy-Con 2 on over and over (I will say, the idea of being this rough with controllers that keep going up in price made me feel a little uneasy).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you manage to get past those initial road blocks, you can start learning some neat tricks to score bonus points. You can pull off a bunny hop as you shoot the ball to score an extra tenth of a point – which is a leap you perform by grabbing your wheels and lifting both controllers up in quick succession. A flashy 540-degree turn that leads into a two-handed slam dunk is worth .4 extra points, and it’s really satisfying trying to get an opening to pull off these risky, advanced techniques – and I had multiple games come down to a fraction of a point difference. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defense is pretty fun, too: you need to slam into a ball-handling opponent head-on to knock it loose, literally put your hands in the air to try and block a shot, or quickly snag a rebound to regain possession. I learned how important it is to hit the brakes to stop directly in front of an opponent and get up in their face. It accurately replicates the intensity and excitement of a close pickup game, with great moments like grabbing a rebound and driving all the way down the court for an open three, or throwing up a last-second buzzer beater, complete with a dramatic slow motion effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You <em>can</em> play offline with bots that are decently smart and always pass you the ball if you signal that you’re open, but the action excels when you take it online with five friends or strangers. It’s fun to coordinate with teammates over GameChat to set them up for an open shot or decide who to guard on defense – and like most competitive multiplayer games of this nature, there’s really no reason to play offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, outside of the arena, Drag x Drive doesn’t have much going on. The whole affair takes place in what’s called the Park, which has about as much personality as its one-word name implies. It has the same color palette and atmosphere you’d expect from a mall parking lot, with gray concrete everywhere, faint, forgettable music off in the distance, and nobody around (unless you’re playing online, where up to 12 people can join a Park together). Scattered around are a small handful of fun time-based challenges, like racing through obstacle courses, jumping rope 100 times in a row, or scoring as many points as possible, but after reaching the target time for most of them in just a couple of hours, I was left wishing there were more challenges to complete. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One neat idea is that if you’re playing in an online lobby and roaming around the Park trying out challenges at your own pace, a giant video board displays live updates of who has the highest scores in each one. Some challenges award gold rings to the record-holder so everyone wheeling around the park can see who’s the champ. Both features encourage friendly competition if you all buy into it, and I can see this being a decently fun place to hang out with a group of friends as everyone tries to set new high scores in between matches. There are also group minigames to break things up, though those amount to a 30-second race or a sprint to see who can grab the ball first. They’re both pretty skippable, and fortunately, you can easily opt out of participating and just wait for the real game to begin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big issue holding Drag x Drive back is that there’s just not that much reason to do anything. Earning trophies by winning games and completing challenges unlocks new helmet designs for your character, but that’s pretty much the only unlockable, and the customization options honestly aren’t that exciting when it’s all just helmets with one or two minor differences, like bunny ears or a spiky hairdo. There’s no leveling up, no meaningful achievements, and nothing to work toward that makes me want to boot up Drag x Drive when I could be playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>, or another competitive multiplayer game. I don’t necessarily think a game <em>needs</em> this stuff to be fun, but after 10 hours, I’m skeptical I’ll have much reason to come back outside of friend hangouts. And that’s only if my friends put in the time to click with the gameplay like I have.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even things like a varied soundtrack, multiple court designs, or original characters with personalities (like in Arms and Splatoon) would go a long way here, but instead it all just feels like the bare minimum. It’s incredibly generic, and it’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package. That’s not usually Nintendo’s style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also has to be said that it’s ironic how, in a game that’s clearly based on wheelchair basketball, there’s no option to play with anything but these physically demanding motion controls, and the settings to adjust how they work are extremely limited. It’s not exactly a poster child for accessibility in video games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Drag x Drive controls like nothing else I’ve ever played, and it asks a lot of you in order to get used to its complicated mouse and motion mechanics. Obviously, if you don't like (or literally can’t use) forced motion controls like this, then you should steer clear. But once I put in the time to "get good," I really enjoyed the surprisingly deep fundamentals of Nintendo's unique take on wheelchair basketball. Its online three-on-three matches are a lot of fun, and it has some good ideas for provoking friendly competition between rounds that I wish were fleshed out a little bit more. That lack of substance is the most disappointing part about Drag x Drive, with little in the way of unlockables, customization, personality, and variety. I imagine a hardcore group of fans could rally around it, because its movement is very cool and there is a ton of potential to discover in its exciting trick system – but with a high initial barrier to entry and not enough reasons to stick around for the long haul once you’ve cleared it, it’s hard to see Drag x Drive establishing itself among an already crowded field of online multiplayer options.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are not retconning what we have done in the past."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> development team has answered fan questions on the future of the franchise's modern day storyline, as well as various lingering plot threads left unanswered in the series' recent blockbuster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows is designed as something of a soft reboot for the series, with no playable modern day section and a strong focus on the real-life historical elements found in its version of feudal Japan. Little mention is made of events from previous games — something that ensures new players don't feel like they need to head to Wikipedia and catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's story reintroduces the Assassins and Templars slowly, and makes no mention of Basim — a major character seen within Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> whose fate is left open-ended. The Isu, Assassin's Creed's mysterious precursor race, meanwhile do not play a part at all — following a string of games where the hunt for one of their artefacts acted as the main macguffin. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, during a fan Q&amp;A on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, the game's development team has answered questions regarding whether the series will deliver more modern day storyline in the future, whether we'll see Basim again, and which of the game's current crossovers are canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With AC Shadows we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the modern day storyline with the Animus Hub," wrote level design director Luc Plante. "That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, fans can unlock snippets of text logs that tell a fresh story featuring various Assassin and Templar units in what seems to be the near future. So, technically, rather than the "modern day", this storytelling time period now appears to be a number of decades ahead (and something that conveniently means ongoing plot threads like the character of Basim can be moved past).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will fans get more of Basim's story? Valhalla's ending left the character's future wide open, with many fans expecting him to appear again in a prominent role. Mirage, which tells the story of his origins, meanwhile once featured a bizarre post-credits scene hinting at more from the game set to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have complex new characters that were introduced in Shadows that we didn't feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well," Plante continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Basim's story be picked up in Shadows? It seems unlikely. The character feels too far removed from the game's Japanese storyline, and it's easy to see why Ubisoft did not have a place for him in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, it's worth remembering that Ubisoft declined to comment earlier this year on a report in a French newspaper that stated the company was now working on new content for Mirage, following an injection of funding from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund. Perhaps this, if and when it arrives, will be used to wrap up Basim's narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The AC lore is very complex and keep expending as we are creating new games," Plante said, when asked why events in the franchise's expanded universe of games and comics were not mentioned specifically within Shadows. "We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn't directly support the narrative we are building. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has taken a similar approach to the Isu, who remained off-screen within the game. Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla leant heavily into their settings' mythological elements. Shadows, however, treated (almost) everything without the need for a supernatural or sci-fi explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of Shadows doesn't mean that it doesn't exist in the world of Shadows," Plante said, "it just wasn't a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of supernatural elements, Plante confirmed Shadows' unlockable Dead by Daylight content was "not canon to the story of Shadows." That said, the recent Critical Role crossover with the new character of Rufino <em>is</em> canon, and tied into the game's main themes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, due on September 16. Alongside a fresh region to explore, the add-on will expand on Shadows' current ending with new story for Naoe and Yasuke. Maybe the Isu are lurking somewhere within it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
