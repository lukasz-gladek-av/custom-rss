		<p>Nintendo has released an overview trailer for the addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/virtual-boy-is-joining-the-switch-online-library-but-youll-need-a-stereoscopic-accessory/">Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics</a> on Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, launching on 17th February 2026 alongside the Virtual Boy accessory (both the cardboard model and plastic recreation).</p>
<p><iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics – Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvaCe4esCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Available as part of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> membership, Nintendo is rolling in a bunch of the niceties that are common to all the other emulated games in the service. You’re able to rewind the game state if you make a mistake, and you can pause the game to check and modify controller mappings.</p>
<p>Another major feature will be the ability to recolour the games from the red-on-black look that defined this strange era of Nintendo gaming, to having yellow, green, white or potentially more. If using the plastic headset, you’ll have to remove a red colour filter in order for this feature to work.</p>
<p>The seven launch titles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>3-D Tetris</li>
<li>Galactic Pinball</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>The Mansion of Innsmouth</li>
<li>Red Alarm</li>
<li>Teleroboxer</li>
<li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming later in 2026 are more games from the catalogue, including two previously unreleased titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>D-Hopper (previously unreleased)</li>
<li>Jack Bros.</li>
<li>Mario Clash</li>
<li>Mario’s Tennis</li>
<li>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</li>
<li>Virtual Bowling</li>
<li>Vertical Force</li>
<li>V-Tetris</li>
<li>Zero Racers (previously unreleased)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Virtual Boy was an ignominious flop in the mid 90s, selling only 770,000 united before being discontinued, though has later come to be appreciated for its bold step toward what has eventually become VR gaming. Part of its failure has to be put down to the technology of the time, so while it offered stereoscopic 3D, it exclusively used red LED lights to render the graphics and give a sense of depth. Additionally, instead of being strapped to your head like a modern VR headset, the Virtual Boy sat on a tabletop mount, providing a fixed view to players of its games and giving an awkwardness to how you engage with the system, no doubt contributing to the headaches, dizziness and eye strain that the system became known for inducing.</p>
<p>Nintendo’s desire to constantly experiment and innovate has seen them return to 3D on various occasions, though. The most famous, of course, was the Nintendo 3DS, which featured an autostereoscopic top screen that could create 3D without the need for glasses. While impressive, the impact of this diminished over time until Nintendo released 2D-only versions of the 3DS. A fun little aside for the Nintendo Labo project on original Switch had a cardboard VR adapter, similar in concept to early VR adapters for phones, where you slot the screened device into a box with lenses to get the same effect. It’s this notion that is being revived for emulating the Virtual Boy in 2026.</p>
<p>It will be really interesting to see if and how this new version of Virtual Boy works.</p>

            <guid>1417612</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="b0044f63e3801"><a title="The Last Story 15th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0044f63e3801/the-last-story-15th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / XSEED</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back at the tail-end of the Wii's run as the hottest console ticket in town, so around about 2011 to be precise, there were a few special RPGs that released in rather quick succession to give Nintendo's magic box a surprisingly exciting last hurrah.</p>
<p>Indeed, casting my mind back now — and unaided by AI, I'll have you know — I seem to remember something called '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/07/talking_point_the_growing_storm_of_operation_rainfall">Operation Rainfall</a>', which was a fan-side campaign to have three outstanding RPGs brought over to the West; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/xenoblade_chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/pandoras_tower">Pandora's Tower</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/last_story">The Last Story</a>.</p>
<p>We can argue all day about how much effect this campaign actually had in the end (as far as I recall, Xenoblade was already on the way), but it was exciting times for sure, and rallying behind the release of this trio of titles had us all chomping at the bit to get stuck into 'em.</p>
<p>But were they — and more specifically, was The Last Story — actually any good? Well, I think we all know the answer to that is a resounding 'yes', so let's not bother with the pantomime build-up and just get on with saying Happy 15th Birthday to you, The Last Story, you absolute belter!</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/irm-going-to-be-a-grandfather-very-soon-is-neo-dimension-hironobu-sakaguchirs-final-fantasian">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, who you may know as the father of the little known '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>' franchise of 'video games' (never heard of them), The Last Story is somewhat poignant, before we even begin on the game itself, in being Sakaguchi's return to directing duties following a personally painful period that culminated in his departure from Square.</p>

<p>Having got himself deeply involved in the creation of <strong>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</strong>, which tanked at the box office and cost Square dearly, the RPG maestro distanced himself from the industry for years before returning with a new studio. Mistwalker went on to bring us the excellent <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/lost_odyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></strong> and <strong>Blue Dragon</strong> (which wasn't quite so great) before releasing The Last Story itself, Sakaguchi's final full-on console game before spinning off into mobile-first fare.</p>
<p>Back when The Last Story released, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wii/last_story">former NL editor Tom Whitehead gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it took a fresh approach for the time, and for the most part, this freshness comes down to real-time combat that's semi-automated in its approach. Please, don't recoil in horror, though, as there's so much going on here that, in practice, those automated attacks are a blessing.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Zael, a mercenary and gang leader on the island of Lazilus, you act as a sort of field marshal or point guard-type figure during party combat, one who directs the flow of battle by assigning tasks, attacks, manoeuvres and so on to party members via your crossbow target. You still have direct control over Zael, and you can even assign attacks to a button if you want, but there's so much going on, especially in bigger battles, that automated feels right, once you get used to it.</p>
<p>The game has a nice take on a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/gears_of_war">Gears</a>-style cover system built in, and when it's all working well, it feels as much like a full-on action game as it does an RPG (hence all the frame rate stutters at times). Missions do well in giving you exploration opportunities before funnelling you towards big, inescapable boss scraps and cinematic moments. It's the sort of thing you can blow through in about 20 hours, or spend 50 hoovering everything up.</p>

<p>Whilst there's no doubt it definitely takes some getting used to, and the real struggle is in the first few hours before fights really open up, stick with this one and its winning formula shines through, giving you something different to grapple with on the combat front <em>and</em> something different nestled at the heart of a strong story.</p>
<p>I won't ruin that part here, because I genuinely want you to go play it, but if you loved the unique vibe of the likes of The Lost Odyssey, you'll get that same sort of feeling from this one. It's magical and beguiling in a strange, eerie, and delicate sort of way.</p>
<p>The Last Story nails its look and its atmosphere hard, and while it may not be the most impressive thing to behold overall (and especially in today's economy), it's also a weirdly timelessly stylised thing that still manages to bewitch. It helps, too, in this regard, that the soundtrack by none other than Nobuo Uematsu is a corker.</p>

<p>Even now, 15 years down the line from its Japanese launch (the English-localised version came out the following year), booting into the game for the first time in at least a decade, I find that it still holds up in terms of this uncanny atmosphere and in its capacity to captivate. Indeed, although the performance issues and stutters that held it back from a better score from Tom at launch are very notable these days, this is still something I'll happily sit down and get totally lost in all over again.</p>
<p>Now, enough cake and celebrating. Where's my Switch 2 remake with 120fps combat and motion controls?</p>

              <p>Valve’s attempt to have courts dismiss a legal action brought against it for allegations of overcharging and anti-competitive practices has failed, as reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">the <em>BBC</em></a>. A <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">judge’s ruling</a> is allowing the case brought by lawyer Vicki Shotbolt to go ahead on behalf of 14 million Steam users in the UK.</p> <p>First filed in 2024, Shotbolt’s claim (with <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/about-us/">its own fancy website</a>) is an attempt to prove that Valve’s policies on Steam violate UK laws on “anti-competitive prices” and “unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.” The argument concerns Valve’s demand that games sold on Steam not be made available at a permanently lower price on rival stores, <em>and</em> that once you buy a game on Steam, the only way you can buy further content for that game—be it DLC, expansion packs or cosmetics—is also via Steam. This, Shotbolt claims, allows Valve to “hold a dominant position in the PC gaming market” and “that it may have used this position in ways that violate UK competition law.”</p>

 <p>Class action lawsuits are not a commonplace event in the UK, where the mass litigation is known as a “collective action claim,” and works on an “opt-out” basis. Basically, Shotbolt and her law firm are going to sue Valve on behalf of British Steam users unless they specifically say they don’t want in. That’s how it’s able to claim to be suing on behalf of 14 million people.</p> <p>Valve, obviously, objects to the claims, and filed to have the case thrown out. A ruling filed January 26 by the Competition Appeal Tribunal says that Valve opposed on the basis that the “PCR” (the shorthand for Shotbolt’s group) “had not put forward an adequate methodology” before venturing all manner of peculiarly specific fiddly details about “determining the effect of the alleged PPOs [Platform Parity Obligations]” and that the “class definition was inadequate” and so on. The latter was seemingly based on lots of kids using Steam, and how they couldn’t opt in or out of the action. It all seemed to amount to “They didn’t cross their Ts sufficiently,” and the tribunal was having none of that.</p>

 <p>Shotbolt’s team promised to double-check their punctuation, and that seemed to be enough to have Valve’s concerns overturned. “The PCR proposed revisions to the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/#classDefinition">proposed class definition</a> which substantially diminished the concerns raised by Valve,” says the ruling, which appears to mean they rejigged things to ensure it was just representing over 13s…I think? “In light of that development,” says the ruling, “the Tribunal rejected Valve’s challenge in this respect.”</p>

 <p>All of that basically amounts to “Yup, this action can go ahead,” which will mightily annoy Valve. Those who don’t want to be included in the entire PC gaming population of Britain will have the option to opt out pretty soon, given <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/">the site’s FAQ</a> stated it was waiting for this very certification before offering the option. Given 99.9 percent of Steam users will never even know this action is taking place, that sounds impressively farcical.</p> <p>Should the PCR win, it’ll mean everyone in the UK is entitled to some money back, which will likely be fairly meaningless amounts to all involved except for Valve. The claim is looking for £656 million, which at the time of writing is $904 million. Given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-pc-sued-price-fixing-1851537419">when we first covered this story in 2024</a> that figure converted to $838 million, Valve will likely hope for a quick resolution before Trump manages to tank the dollar even further.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve</a> is going to have to defend itself in court for its pricing and commission practices. A class action lawsuit in the United Kingdom (UK) brought against the company is looking for roughly $900 million (£656 million) in damages.</p>



<p>First filed back in 2024 by Vicki Shotbolt, the lawsuit claims that Valve charges “excessive commission charges” that lead to <strong>“an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers”.</strong></p>







<p>The <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit also alleges</a> that Valve forces platform party obligations <strong>“that prohibit publishers from selling products through other distribution channels on better terms than the same Products are available on Steam.”</strong> They say that this practice is likely to restrict competition. </p>



<h2 id="h-valve-argues-that-there-s-not-enough-evidence">Valve Argues That There’s Not Enough Evidence</h2>







<p>Valve’s defense claims that the group suing the company can’t establish proper claims regarding its commission pricing due to the fact that the suit doesn’t “consider the effect of Steam Keys”.</p>



<p><strong>“Without a credible plan for taking Steam Keys into account, the PCR cannot establish Steam’s actual effective commission charge, and without this, the PCR cannot establish whether the commission charge amounts to an unfair price,”</strong> Valve argues.</p>



<p>They also say that suing group <strong>“failed to show a plan to determine which Steam Partners actually paid these allegedly unfair prices.”</strong></p>







<p>Despite these arguments and others, the London Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the case must move forward. As of publishing, Valve has not responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>The case was filed on behalf of up to 14 million users, including minors. Shotbolt’s attorneys say that the average loss ranges between $30-$60 (£22-£44) per person.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/</link>
            <guid>1417588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>High-level players seeking a greater challenge and impossible odds in ARC Raiders have a sadistic new mode to tackle—Solos vs Squads. It’s exactly as it sounds, and if you want to play the new game mode and see what it’s all about, read on for full guide details.</p>



<p>If you thought there was enough danger in ARC Raiders, think again. The January <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds Update</a> went overboard with a new Solos Vs Squads game mode. The nature of it has the community confused, though, so this should clear up any questions you have, fellow Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">How To Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A simple toggle. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After you’ve updated ARC Raiders to include the Headwinds Update, you should see a setting in the matchmaking box in the bottom corner saying ‘Solos vs. Squads,’ and this is the key to the difficult matchmaking you seek.</strong></p>



<p>Here are some quick steps to help you out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up your copy of ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Make sure the Headwinds Update is installed and ready to go.</li>



<li>Go to the main menu.</li>



<li>Select the matchmaking box in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Highlight <strong>Solo vs. Squads</strong>.</li>



<li>Have it set to <strong>ON</strong>.</li>



<li>ARC Raiders will find a Solo Vs Squads match for you.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-need-to-be-to-play-solo-vs-squads-in-arc-raiders">What Level Do You Need To Be To Play Solo Vs Squads In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>You have to be at least Level 40 to queue up for Solo Vs Squads matchmaking in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re Level 39, you’ll need to grind it out first. This isn’t a mode for newcomers or even relatively experienced players. Solo Vs Squads is a tough test with hardened players and veterans in mind. If you queue up, there’s a high likelihood you’ll be beaten and bested by macho squads keen to bully you. It’s a dangerous battlefield where humans are more dangerous than anarchic ARCs!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">What Is Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This might be a fairer fight. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking means you’ll set foot on the grounds above Sperenza, and you will run into full squads as a solo player in ARC.</strong></p>



<p>There really is no other way to put this: Solo Vs Sqauds is not for the faint of heart. Real people will potentially pose a far greater problem than AI. You need to be extra cautious, and if you get into a firefight, you need to be prepared, because it will be a tough skirmish.</p>



<p>There are reasons to put yourself through this, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-should-you-play-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders">Why Should You Play Solo Vs Squads Matchmaking In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The Solo Vs Squads playlist allows you to earn more XP for kills and extracts while traversing ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>You don’t get extra-special rewards for this game mode; literally, the only incentive is more XP, and that’s it. This might put many of you off immediately, and it’s likely not supposed to be the new mode everyone gravitates toward.</p>



<p>But as Embark has said in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds patch notes</a>: “Solo vs Squads is a new matchmaking option for our experienced and highly skilled players who enjoy the PvP aspect of the game. Solo Raiders level 40 and above will get the “Solo vs Squad” toggle above matchmaking to join the Squads queue and tackle squads of Raiders head-on. When opting in, players will receive +20% bonus XP at the end of the round on both successful extract, and defeat.”</p>



<p>Are you a high enough level to play? Is the extra XP worth the risk with no real rewards on offer? Let the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> know if you intend to ride solo, or if you have other ARC Raiders conversations you want to have!</p>

Shotbolt's lawyers alleged that Valve is preventing publishers from selling products more cheaply or earlier on rival platforms to Steam by imposing conditions on them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has revealed more information about the Virtual Boy games coming to Switch and Switch 2. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/somehow-virtual-boy-is-returning-and-joining-nintendo-switch-online">Unveiled earlier this year to the surprise of many, the company is reviving its early, unsuccessful swing at VR</a> by releasing a selection of games on Nintendo Switch Online that can be played with a peripheral modeled after the original console. Today, a new trailer showed off some of the games coming to the platform, as well as some quality-of-life improvements to hopefully make the notoriously uncomfortable device a little more comfortable.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvaCe4esCQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVvaCe4esCQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The launch catalogue of games, available on February 17, includes Teleroboxer, Galactic Pinball, Red Alarm, Golf, Virtual Boy Wario Land, 3-D Tetris, and The Mansion of Innsmouth. That last game, known as Innsmouth no Yakata in Japan, was never officially released in the US before now.</p><p>The ad also shows other games coming to the service later this year, including Mario Clash, Mario Tennis, Jack Bros, Space Invaders Virtual Collection, Virtual Bowling, Vertical Force, and V-Tetris. These games, along with the seven above, were announced when the Virtual Boy's return was announced, but today's footage showed two more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/02/28/virtual-boy-f-zero-spinoff-that-never-released-was-done-according-to-former-nintendo">Zero Racers</a> and D-Hopper, are also coming to the service. Both games have never been released before, due in part to the console's short lifespan, so this is the first time they'll be playable for the public. None of the non-launch games have a specific release date just yet, but other game collections in the Nintendo Classics library are released in packs of one to two every month or so, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume the Virtual Boy games would follow the same schedule.</p>

<p>Finally, Nintendo also shared some quality of life improvements, which are largely in-line with features you expect in other Nintendo Classics apps, including suspended saves at any time, remappable controls, and a rewind feature, which helps mitigate the sometimes frustrating design of titles from that era. Players will also be able to adjust games' colors, with footage showing the screen changing the red pixels white, green, or yellow. This feature isn't coming until later in the year, however, and doesn't work with the Virtual Boy cardboard model.</p><p>The Virtual Boy launch games and headsets drop on February 17. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/?srsltid=AfmBOoqgvClFvS8kUs4phnkOq8YYrUxK8G6Ya8V1ceZuYF2km-gp20ku">The more authentic plastic model is $99.99</a>, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">the cardboard one will run you $24.99</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-boy-classics-for-switch-will-include-unreleased-games]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Competition Appeal Tribunal has ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.
</p>
<p>
Shotbolt's suit further alleged Valve's decision to prohibit consumers from purchasing DLC for their Steam games on rival platforms also restricted market competition, which, when combined with an "excessive commission of up to 30 percent" caused "inflated prices on its Steam". As such, it asserted UK consumers are paying too much for purchasing PC games and DLC.
</p>
<p>
In response, Valve had argued the case should not be certified to proceed toward a trial, but (as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">per the BBC</a>) the Competition Appeal Tribunal has now ruled otherwise. "A hearing to consider the PCR's application for a collective proceedings order ("CPO") took place on 14 October 2025," a notice in the tribunal's website explained. "On 26 January 2026, the Tribunal issued its judgment granting the CPO application ([2026] CAT 4)." Eurogamer has approached Valve for comment on the ruling.
</p><p>
Shotbolt's lawsuit is being handled by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which specialises in group action cases against large companies (the firm was also behind a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">2022 filing against Sony</a>, which was similarly accused of abusing its market power). The collective action claim argues 14m people in the UK have been overcharged for PC games as a result of Valve's actions, and is seeking compensation of between £22 and £44 for each one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, Forbes announced ForbesPredict, its own foray into the current trend of gamifying the question of “what fresh hell.” Unlike Polymarket or Kalshi, no money will change hands here: Forbes readers will make forecasts on the news in exchange for Forbes’ own tokens. This is an important distinction on a practical and legal level–as Forbes writes in its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pr/2026/01/23/forbes-partners-with-axiom-to-launch-forbespredict-a-first-of-its-kind-prediction-platform-built-for-media/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>news release</u></a>, “There's no wagering, no leverage, no regulatory burden”--but a meaningless one in terms of how the rise of prediction markets is rotting journalism.&nbsp;</p><p>ForbesPredict, aiming to release in beta in February, is the outlet’s effort to staunch the bleed of Google traffic and the rise of AI. “ForbesPredict gives our audience a reason to return, participate and invest their thinking — not just consume headlines,” says Chief Innovation Officer Nina Gould in the company’s release. The idea seems to be that predicting news outcomes will keep readers hanging around on Forbes, as well as encourage them to give Forbes more of their sweet, sweet first-party data <a href="https://digiday.com/media/forbes-tests-prediction-platform-as-engagement-strategies-move-past-search/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in exchange for tokens</u></a>. The company also sees value here for its writers, with Forbes CEO Sherry Phillips saying that “We also think it will help to keep our newsroom informed of what our audiences are thinking on topics we cover, and we’re excited to see how that informs our storytelling.”&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is, admittedly, an innovation on the rise of prediction markets in journalism. <a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CNN</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/cnbc-and-kalshi-strike-exclusive-partnership.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CNBC</u></a> have joined forces with Kalshi to feature Kalshi data on their news broadcasts; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/polymarket-becomes-yahoo-finance-exclusive-174917116.html?guccounter=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Yahoo Finance</u></a> and <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/press-room/polymarket-and-dow-jones-publisher-of-the-wall-street-journal-announce-exclusive-prediction-market-partnership/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dow Jones</u></a> have partnered with Polymarket. These companies are tripping over themselves to try to explain why a bunch of randos prognosticating for cash on an unknowable future in our increasingly unpredictable and cash-strapped times is actually meaningful information instead of sweaty bullshit, but as <a href="https://www.status.news/p/polymarket-kalshi-prediction-cnn-cnbc-media?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Status News</u></a> points out,&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Notably, most news organizations did not include prediction market odds in their coverage prior to striking what are likely lucrative deals with companies like Kalshi and Polymarket. That suggests they did not actually find the data to be very informative for viewers prior to inking fruitful agreements.</blockquote><p>Dow Jones claims its Polymarket partnership will “help consumers better interpret market sentiment;” CNBC and CNN both believe Kalshi “has become the definitive source for staying informed about the future.” Forbes at least recognizes the misinterpretation of scale here, with CEO of its tech partner Axiom Jeff Yam noting that<strong> </strong>“Real-money prediction markets are built for a niche audience.” Forbes’ platform is at least built for its own niche audience, while the money-based prediction markets have spilled over their own borders to gain an <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>outsized presence</u></a> in how news outlets imagine the opinions and values of regular people. But this doesn’t offset the fact that everyone here is legitimizing the idea that these systems are <em>information</em> and not just a cacophony of self-interested braying or gamified hopelessness that’s both the symptom and the disease of exactly how shit it is to live in our current world.&nbsp;</p><p>That something is just noise doesn’t make it entirely meaningless; much hay was made over a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-400000-payout-after-maduros-capture-put-prediction-markets-in-the-spotlight-heres-how-they-work?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$400k payout on Polymarket regarding the presidency of Nicolás Maduro</u></a> that suggested someone had foreknowledge of Trump’s strike on Venezuela and wanted to make some money off that fact. There are likely insiders out there manipulating prediction markets to their own ends, and this could be a kind of source of a kind of information. But it could just as easily be trolling, luck, or efforts to fuck with public sentiment, journalists and their readers.&nbsp;</p><p>Prediction markets aren’t news, and they aren’t audience research beyond the fact that people like gambling. Tech companies know they can profit off this (don’t get me started on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coverd-launches-app-turns-everyday-160000194.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the app where you can gamble on your own bills</u></a>), and news outlets are willing to let themselves be taken for a ride because they, like prediction markets’ users, are desperate for funds and short on places to get it. Everyone in these situations is manipulating and being manipulated. There is no value in pretending otherwise except to secure your own bag, whether out of greed or legitimately limited options. But the more that news outlets turn to these platforms, the more false meaning these systems threaten to take on, and the more warped and potentially influential their false promise becomes.&nbsp;</p><p>These partnerships and products are outlets throwing up their hands at the growing challenge of telling people the truth because they believe the truth matters, joining the fray they employ journalists to see through. The promise of gambling is the promise of a quick fix, and as nice as it might be to pretend otherwise, there isn’t one coming. But that doesn’t mean news outlets have to descend into the same desperate nihilism that fuels prediction markets, especially in a time when journalists’ duty to cut through the noise is more important than ever. I’m not going to pretend everyone, news outlets and bettors alike, doesn’t need money, but there has to be a better way to get it.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><div><p>Polymarket And Kalshi Want You To Gamble On Everything, Including Video Game Award Shows</p><p>“Financialize everything”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/splatoon-3-update-11-0-0-brings-flow-aura-farming-health-bars-and-smaller-hit-boxes/</link>
            <guid>1417549</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> update 11.0.0 has been released, and Nintendo has made some really interesting changes to the game, adding things like Flow Aura, health bars and tweaking hit box sizes.</p>
<p>Presumably inspired by the whole “aura farming” slang, players that are doing well in battle are now granted a Flow Aura, which grants the Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, Ink Resistance Up and Intensify Action abilities while it lasts. You can extend the effect by defeating more enemies, or getting assists.</p>


<p>Speaking of defeating enemies, you no longer have to look to see how splattered enemies are for an indication of their health, because when people take damage, they’ll now have a health bar – this is sensibly hidden when the opponent’s body is not visible, so it won’t reveal obscured people.</p>
<p>And then there’s a bit of give and take with hit boxes. Hit boxes for squid form are getting a bit smaller, with Nintendo reasoning that players are now more skilled with motion controls than they were a decade ago. At the same time, the projectiles are being tweaked, so that shorter range weapons have larger hit box projectiles, and longer range are more like the same. It means that it’ll be harder for snipers to hit a squid form player, while encouraging the short-ranged weapon players to really get up close and personal.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that these are some pretty core changes, Nintendo has noted that they anticipate having a smaller point update in the near future to tweak this new balance. In general, I think it’s probably a good update, but I know that having health bars visible is going to annoy purists, so hopefully they’re made optional.</p>

<p>Here’s the Splatoon 3 Update 11.0.0 patch notes:</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Multiplayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players will now gain a Flow Aura when they do well in battle, such as when they defeat opponents consecutively within a short period of time.
<ul>
<li>The Flow Aura lasts for a short amount of time.</li>
<li>While a player’s Flow Aura persists, its duration will be extended slightly whenever they defeat an opponent or their teammates defeat an opponent they damaged.</li>
<li>When a player gains a Flow Aura or extends the duration of their Flow Aura, the ground at that player’s feet will be inked with their colour.</li>
<li>While a Flow Aura persists, the Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, Ink Resistance Up and Intensify Action abilities will be applied.</li>
<li>Continuously getting assists with your allies or inking territory during battles will make it more likely to gain a Flow Aura when defeating opponents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When an ally or opponent has taken damage, that player’s approximate remaining health will now be displayed.
<ul>
<li>Opponents’ remaining health will display for approximately three seconds immediately after taking damage.</li>
<li>When the main part of an opponent’s body is not visible, such as when they are behind terrain or swimming in ink, their remaining health will not display.
<ul>
<li>When things like Thermal Ink or the Point Sensor are revealing an opponent’s position, their remaining health will display even if the player cannot see them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slightly decreased the collision detection size for players in swim form to make it harder for opponents’ attacks to hit.</li>
<li>Expanded the collision detection size for each main weapon’s attacks to make it easier to hit opponents with attacks. Also made it so that the shorter the weapon’s shot flight distance, the greater the increase to the collision detection size will be.</li>
<li>When attempting to jump a long distance with Super Jump while the Stealth Jump ability is equipped, increased the time required to make the jump by up to one second depending on the distance.
<ul>
<li>When jumping from near the player’s base to parts farther in, or vice versa, this will increase the jump time based on the distance.</li>
<li>The increase is applied to the time spent flying through the air. This will not change the time spent on the ground preparing for the Super Jump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted the size of the circle indicating the explosion radius for the Reefslider to the radius of the area that deals 220.0 damage instead of to the radius inked.</li>
<li>Specifications for some main weapons have changed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Changes to SplatNet 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the used weapon display under X Rankings to show the most frequently used weapon in X Battles for that mode during a certain period instead of the last used weapon.
<ul>
<li>Due to this change, the weapon used to determine the top players for weapons will be changed in the same way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This update focuses on making changes to battle-related systems and multiplayer balance.</p>
<p>For information about battle system changes like the Flow Aura, displaying remaining health, collision detection adjustments and extended jump duration for Super Jumps with Stealth Jump, please see the <a title="What’s new in the Splatoon 3 – Version 11.0.0 update?" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html" target="nintendo" rel="noopener">news article</a>.</p>
<p>Among the balance changes, the updates for the L-3 Nozzlenose and Dynamo Roller are not simple upgrades. Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p>
<p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p>
<p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p>
<p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p>
<p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p>
<p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Player Controls
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie Dodge Roll from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes to Multiplayer
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Valve's lawyers won't be able to file away one of the legal legalings they've been dealing with for a little while now, at least not yet. A tribunal have ruled that the £656m lawsuit brought against the company by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt and law firm Milberg London LLP last year - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-owe-you-44-quid-according-to-a-656-lawsuit-against-the-company-for-allegedly-overcharging-uk-customers">the one</a> that could net UK dwellers who've bought stuff on Steam since early June 2018 up to £44 in compensation - can go ahead.</p>
<p>As a result, Valve's Lionel Hutzes will have to face the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">lawsuit's accusations</a> that the company have used Steam's "dominant position" in the PC market to behave "anti-competitively", with the end result that regular folks are "paying too much for PC games and in-game content and have lesser PC Game platform alternatives".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">BBC</a>, Valve had been arguing the case shouldn't get the stamp of approval to proceed to trial. However, a competition appeal tribunal have ruled that the case will be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">summary of the tribunal's judgement</a>, which begins by outlining three key cogs to Shotbolt's accusations. The lawsuit claims that Valve impose platform parity obligations with Steam that stop publishers from selling games on rival stores with better terms. It also accuses Valve of using anti-steering provisions to lock in-game purchases made in Steam games into using the storefront's "application programming interface", wich means payments are subject to Valve’s commission charges. Finally, the lawsuit claims Valve are "imposing excessive commission charges which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers".</p><p>Valve, meanwhile, argued at this tribunal that Shotbolt's lawsuit hadn't "put forward an adequate methodology for determining Valve’s effective commission charge" and failed to consider how Steam Keys factor in. The company also claimed the suit lacked "an adequate empirical method for determining the effect" of the alleged platform parity obligations. Valve also argued that the Shotbolt's lawsuit lacked a "workable methodology" that Steam users, including minors, could use to identify themselves as being part of the group being claimed on behalf of by the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Evaluating those three arguments from Valve, the tribunal "accepted that the effect of Steam Keys is a slightly unusual feature in calculating Valve’s effective commission charge and could result in uncertainty in the price alleged to be unfair", but judged that Shotbolt and co "would be able to make a sufficient estimate using data from a range of sources". As far as the platform parity obligations went, the tribunal ruled that the lawsuit "would not simply rely on nebulous economic theory, as claimed by Valve, but rather on a mixture of evidence to support and evaluate a harm that competition law conventionally considers to occur".</p>
<p>Last of all, the tribunal opted to reject Valve's challenge about the methods of identifying which Steam users were being claimed on behalf of. Though, this came after Shotbolt and co outlined "revisions to the proposed class definition", which "tied the class tightly to the party who has suffered the loss, reducing the potential concern of the record keeping of minors".</p>
<p>So, on rumbles the case, no doubt feeling refreshed by virtue of having had a room full of people in suits shout big words at each other in relation to it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-26250mah-power-bank-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-as-this-300w-max-3-port-charger-starts-selling-out-fast-2000663253</link>
            <guid>1417537</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Prime Power Bank is a 26,250 mAh portable power bank with three ports, a compact Phantom Gray housing, and compatibility with laptops, tablets, and phones. The Anker Prime Power Bank allows you to charge up to 300W through two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so a notebook, phone, and additional items, such as headphones or earbuds, can charge at the same time without taking turns. It’s small enough to fit into backpacks and carry-on luggage and has a TSA-approved battery size, so you can generally fly with it. There is also a smart display screen on the front of the unit that shows charging information.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">You can find the Anker Prime Power Bank on Amazon today for $171, down from its original $230, which represents a savings of $59 and 26% off the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hefty power bank with plenty of charging power</h2>
<p><span>The charging configuration on the Anker Prime Power Bank is optimized for rapid charging of larger items while supporting smaller items. One USB-C port delivers up to 140W with a compatible 5A cable for rapid laptop recharging, and the other two USB-C and USB-A ports recharge your phone, earbuds, or other accessories simultaneously. With a maximum of 300W, you can use the bank as a central charging station rather than just to recharge your phone.</span></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Power Bank was also optimized to charge quickly, allowing the unit to spend more time available for use rather than idling due to discharge. The dual USB-C ports will accept up to 250W of combined input and allow the bank to recharge to approximately 50% in around 13 minutes and fully recharge in approximately 1 hour if you have the correct chargers.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying how much capacity remains in the bank and the current amount of power it is supplying, a smart display will show the status of each device currently charging via a simple visual display, eliminating the need to guess whether a device is charging. When paired with Anker’s app, you can view charging activity in even greater detail and adjust your usage preferences for how you want power used.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the overall design allows users to place the Anker Prime Power Bank wherever they want to recharge their devices, including desks, bags, hotel nightstands, and many other locations. The bank’s compact frame is light enough for daily carrying but feels sturdy and substantial when placed next to a laptop with several cables plugged into it. In the box, you will receive the Anker Prime Power Bank, a 3.3-foot-long 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, a travel pouch, a welcome guide, and a 24-month limited hardware warranty. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">With the entire package bundled at $171 instead of the usual $230, the Anker Prime Power Bank is an affordable source of portable power in one small unit.</a></p>

            <p>One of 2025's strangest announcements from Nintendo was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-announced-for-switch-1-and-2-at-nintendo-direct">the return of the Virtual Boy</a>, a hardware (and software) failure that's been reappraised over the years. Many gamers have a soft spot for it, however, so its inclusion in Nintendo Switch Online's offerings probably was an easy decision to make as the video game giant looked to spice the subscription up. Now we have access to the full roster of games available at launch and teases of more to come.</p>
<p>Via the Nintendo Today app and later YouTube (watch the video below), Nintendo released a new trailer that runs for almost four minutes and details the games coming on 17th February, other classics arriving at a later date, and even two previously unreleased titles.</p>

<p>Teleroboxer, Galactic Pinball, RED ALARM, GOLF, Virtual Boy Wario Land, 3-D TETRIS, and The Mansion of Innsmouth lead the red charge next month, with Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Virtual Collection, Virtual Bowling, Vertical Force, and V-Tetris coming later. Features like different rendering colours besides red, customisable controls, and rewind are part of the rollout plans too.</p><p>The two previously unreleased games are Zero Racers, a cancelled 3D F-Zero instalment originally meant to launch in 1996, and D-Hopper (originally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a>), a top-down action-adventure game that was completed but also shelved in 1996 due to Virtual Boy's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Though many have expressed disdain for Nintendo's second attempt at making the Virtual Boy happen, it appears nostalgia might make this whole endeavour a success. In any case, it's refreshing to see a major publisher actually make an effort to preserve old games which weren't financially successful.</p>
<p>If you want to check these out for yourself, you'll need, on top of a Nintendo Switch system (it doesn't matter which), a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Virtual-Boy-Nintendo-Classics-2915432.html?srsltid=AfmBOorpQ1V1e0QdEiTVPr1ZOHHD7khSuB-iyn2aiwPvKp8Q0oDEtMFX">plus one of the two accessories</a> set to launch on 17th February: the Virtual Boy replica or the cheaper cardboard model, both of which work alongside the hybrid consoles to create the original 3D effects. At the time of writing, there are no plans to make these re-releases available in 2D.</p>

<p>An Intelligent Systems top-down adventure also on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We now know the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">launch line-up</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> service, coming to Nintendo Switch Online on <strong>17th February 2026</strong>. And while it's all worth getting excited over, there are two never-before-released games coming out later in the year that Nintendo enthusiasts should be particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Right at the end of the brand new overview trailer (at around <a href="https://youtu.be/nVvaCe4esCQ?si=QQAHZqkIL2PYIKMw&amp;t=187" data-yt-videoid="nVvaCe4esCQ" data-yt-start="187">3:07</a>), Nintendo showed off footage from two cancelled Virtual Boy games that will be playable for the first time ever via Nintendo Switch Online — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a> (also known as Dragon Hopper). Both of these will be coming to the service sometime in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Zero Racers a pretty big deal for long-time Nintendo fans — this is a cancelled <strong>F-Zero</strong> spin-off that was apparently shown off at E3 1996, but was cancelled due to the failure of the Virtual Boy. A few years ago, a former Nintendo of America localiser said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/mythical-virtual-boy-f-zero-spin-off-was-100percent-complete-according-to-former-noa-staffer">the game "was done"</a> (as in complete), and this release seems to confirm that.</p>

<p>The latter game, D-Hopper, is from Intelligent Systems, who we know best for developing the <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games. D-Hopper is very much its own thing, and was also playable at E3 1996 — it's a top-down adventure game where you have to adventure through maze-like maps and fight enemies in order to rescue your girlfriend. A little Zelda-esque, perhaps?</p>
<p>Both of these games are fantastic additions to the service, and we're excited to check them out for the first time ever later in the year. The Virtual Boy might not be well-loved, but it's got an eclectic library of games and spin-offs.</p>
<p>The launch line-up is pretty solid too, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Wario Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3D Tetris</a> all part of the package day-one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/</link>
            <guid>1417480</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valve,</strong> the studio that was once known for making world-class games like <strong>Half-Life</strong> and <strong>Left 4 Dead</strong>, but is lately simply known as the people behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">Steam</a></strong> and hardware like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-is-already-planned-confirms-gabe-newell/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-just-works-steam-machine-verified-badge-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-verification-to-no-ones-surprise/">Steam Machine</a></strong>, is facing a similar ire to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Apple</strong> faced in its legal bout with <strong>Epic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <strong><a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf">London Competition Appeal Tribunal</a></strong> has declared that Valve must face a massive <strong>£656 million class-action lawsuit</strong>, arguing that the company takes an "<em><strong>excessive</strong></em>" <strong>30% revenue cut</strong> of every transaction made on Steam.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-to-face-uk-class-action-lawsuit-with-proposed-damages-of-656m">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/">Reuters</a>), this lawsuit initially began with <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>Parent Zone</strong>, filing the suit in 2024. At the time, Shotbolt said, "<em>Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>," and that she filed the claim in an attempt "<em>to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed</em>."</p>



<p>The suit represents some <strong>14 million UK gamers</strong>, as it claims that the 30% commission Valve takes on every purchase is "<em>Imposing <strong>excessive commission charges</strong> which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers</em>." It also claims that Valve utilizes "<em>anti-steering provisions</em>," which amount to tactics used by Valve to keep customers on Steam, exemplified by the fact that when you purchase a game on Steam, you must also purchase any DLC or add-on content on Steam to use said content.</p>



<p>If some of this, namely the claim that Valve's 30% cut is "<em>excessive</em>," feels familiar to you, that's because back in 2021, <strong>Wolfire Studios</strong> and <strong>Dark Catt Studios</strong> filed a similar case against Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Wolfire was the first to file its suit back in April 2021</a>, which also pinned the same claim against <strong>Sony</strong> with regard to the <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>. Dark Catt Studios filed its suit months later in June 2021, with Wolfire's suit ultimately being dismissed, and only some of the claims made by Dark Catt Studios getting tossed out.</p>



<p>While Dark Catt's suit continued, Wolfire reorganized its arguments and re-filed its suit against Valve. Due to the cases being so similar, they were combined in July 2022, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/">then in November 2024, the combined suit was given class-action status</a>.</p>



<p>Suits like this always take a while to reach a conclusion, so don't hold your breath on this making an impact on the video game industry anytime soon. That said, the potential ramifications of Valve losing a suit like this are monumental and cannot be understated. A Valve loss might even mean that company head<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/"> <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> needs to cut back on his <strong>super yacht budget</strong></a>.</p>

Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501</link>
            <guid>1417468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been less than a week since Ubisoft announced it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>cancelling several projects</span></a><span>, including the long-awaited </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake. That project had apparently been struggling since its 2020 announcement, having essentially started over from scratch </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554"><span>back in 2023</span></a><span>. But while the remake itself may never see the light of day, some concept art and screenshots from the game’s 2024 pre-alpha version have started circulating online. Ubisoft, however, is doing its best to get them taken down before anyone can see what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>The art and images are from a 2024 workshop presentation, and though they don’t show the game in motion, there’s enough here to get a sense of what the team at Ubisoft was working toward before the project was canceled. The presentation was posted to YouTube, then subsequently copyright-struck by Ubisoft. Fans still managed to grab the images, though, and have been sharing them across social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p> <p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p> <p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p> <p>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>From the sound of it, the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake was even further along by the time it was canceled earlier this month, as Eman Ayaz, an actor who has hinted she was playing a role in the game, had shot a marketing promo for the game just two months prior.</span></p> <p><span>“I pushed myself past old limits and discovered things I didn’t even know existed inside of me through the lives that I lived in this character,” Ayaz </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak"><span>says in a YouTube video</span></a><span>. “It was something that’s completely out of the range of any character that I’ve been cast in in the past. And I got to do things I’ve never gotten to do before. And it brought out what I honestly believe is the best performance of my career. And now nobody is ever going to see that. I can’t stress enough how much I had kind of planned my life around the release of this project.”</span></p>

  <p><span>While the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake is probably the most high-profile cancellation at Ubisoft this month, the company shelved five other games and delayed seven more as part of a larger restructuring. Don’t worry though,</span><i><span> Beyond Good and Evil 2 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><span>is still coming</span></a><span>. </span></p>

Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p><p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p><p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p><p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p><p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p><p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Fixes to Player Controls<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie <a title="Companies > Dodge Roll [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/dodge-roll">Dodge Roll</a> from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li></ul></li><li>Fixes to Multiplayer<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/splatoon-3-version-11-0-0-update-launches-january-29]]></content:encoded>
