            <p>Stay in cover. It's coming. THERE. You see it? A tumbleweed, the deadliest of creatures to roam the desert. Stay quiet, it might roll up on us! Well, at least we'll stand some chance of survival, thanks to a patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s devs have just put out in response to the Mesa update being deemed to damn hard.</p>
<p>If you missed this update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peaks-mesa-update-lets-you-shimmy-your-sandy-butt-up-some-sandy-buttes-adds-tornados-and-dynamite">emerging atop the release summit the other day</a>, it adds in the cannibalistic co-op climber's first new biome, offering a different challenge to the alpine cliffs folks have been scaling since the game burst onto the scene. Key to surviving this desert is not to succumb to the heat, get blown up by dynamite, or fail in your attempt to recreate Indy's boulder scene with some mobile shrubbery.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As it's turned out, though, not getting deathed by those threats is providing even harder than expected. "We’re hearing you loud and clear: the Mesa is really hard," co-publishers Aggro Crab and Landfall declare in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/537736322372077260">the notes</a> of the game's latest patch. "Part of me say...<em>good</em> suffer. But it does seem like it’s a bit unfair sometimes, so this patch is to adjust balance and fix bugs that are causing that!"</p>
<p>This brings us to the tumbling weeds. These terrifying bundles of brush now deal thorn damage instead of causing injuries, while their ability to knock you flying has been "made more consistent", and now scales based on the size of the particular tumbleweed. I'm outraged on the part of the plucky little tumbleweeds everywhere who'd been merrily punching above their weight, only to have their power sapped at the whim of Big Weedkiller.</p><p>At least they're not alone. Dynamite now spawns in luggage "slightly less often", and has been robbed of its ability to fatally blow you up through walls. Scorpions now have to be able to see you to become aggroed, have had their movement slowed a little, and "now deal less poison damage depending on how close you already are to passing out". Three more seconds of protection from fall damage has also been added to the scout cannon, and the weight of a mysteriously unnamed  <em>thing</em> has had its weight reduced, mysteriously.</p>
<p>To be fair, developers Team Peak have also helped the tumbleweeds by fixing an issue that'd stopped them from spawning. They've also fixed some problems with the kiln, in addition to disabling the rising lava in it, until they can work out how to make the heat growth sync up across every player in a party's game.</p>
<p>Right. I think the weed's tumbled on. We're clear to move out. Ahh, what's next to cl-wait, is that? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gooner-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98gooner%E2%80%99-reputation-has-been-addressed-by-its-game-director.1269891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the beginning, Marvel Rivals started out as a budding hero shooter. A few weeks in, and it had amassed an audience of several hundred thousand players and counting. It’s established as one of the best free-to-play games, but recent skins that leave little to the imagination have raised eyebrows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> launched with a star-studded roster with fabulous unlockable skins. It is a free-to-play game after all, so paid cosmetics were always going to be a thing. We’ve seen an increased influx of more scantily-clad costumes and somewhat exposed heroes, shall we say, in recent skins—leading to the ‘Gooner’ accusations.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-a-gooner-game">Is Marvel Rivals a ‘Gooner’ Game?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>C’mon, you’ve probably bought at least one of them. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-summer-party-swimsuit-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Summer Party Swimsuit Event</a> and its array of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-costumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swimsuit Costumes</a> have contributed greatly to Marvel Rivals’ ‘Gooner’ label.</p>



<p>Game director Guangyun ‘Guangguang’ Chen recently spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RivalsAssembled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rivals Assembled</a>. In a special interview talking about all things Marvel Rivals—including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOMM</a>—Guangguang was asked: “How do you guys respond to people calling Marvel Rivals a gooner game?”</p>



<p>Guangguang barely flinched before replying: “Because our design is inspired by classic comic themes, including some very outstanding skins, like Mantis and also Psylocke’s Vengeance, these all come from classic comic designs, and we create some more fashionable designs based on them to gain players’ appreciation. I think this also reflects the broad recognition from our players.”</p>



<p>“As mentioned earlier, with the Squirrel Girl and the Krakoa Resort skin, these are actually designs based on real-world themes and the season’s storyline. For designs like these, we try our best to integrate the storylines from the season, including elements from Krakoa, and blend popular elements from real life. We create new designs based on that, and I’m very grateful these designs have been well received by the majority of players.”</p>

<p>Brace Yourself Games is continuing its stellar lineup of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> crossover DLC with a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/everhood">Everhood</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>The succinctly named 'Everhood Music Pack' adds four new tracks to the falling notes rhythm game, all of which will be available to purchase separately or as a bundle. The DLC is now live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/57784/Rift__Everhood_Music_Pack/">Steam</a>, and the developers have announced that it will be falling onto Switch "at a later date" — so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Here are the four tracks from the RPG mash-up series that you'll find in this new wave of crossover bonus content:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Final Battle" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Feisty Flowers" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Revenge" by Cazok<br></li>
<li>"Why Oh You Are LOVE" by Dancefloor is Lava</li>
</ul>
<p>To see in the new releases in style, Brace Yourself Games is also adding a <em>free</em> Rhythm Rift, 'Powers of Destruction' by Cazok, for good measure.</p>
<p>This crossover DLC follows similar collaborations with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pizza_tower">Pizza Tower</a> and Hatsune Miku, and it looks like there's even more to come — which is exciting, because the base game is really rather good.

            <p>The dawn of the second <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta weekend is here. Before it got underway, EA made a few tweaks based on feedback from last week's bout of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>ing about, with the headliners being some playlist changes and the introduction of custom match searching.</p>
<p>It's no massive reinventing of the big battlewheel, but hopefully should make a positive impact on the time folks have in this bit of the beta, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-maps-and-modes-shared-as-ea-write-an-essay-about-tweaks-based-on-labs-feedback">sees the Empire State map debut</a> alongside week one's offerings. Rush and squad deathmatch modes are also joining the fray.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>With the great entry bell for this second beta weekend having just tolled at 9AM BST on August 14th, EA snuck out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">a post last night</a> revealing these "learnings and changes." The playlist rejigs are, I suspect, the bit you'll care most about, with the devs aiming to deliver "more variety and choice" by having more playlists rotate between different modes.</p>
<p>The example given is the All-Out Warfare playlist, which includes Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush modes for this second weekend. "Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time," EA explained. There's a full rundown of which modes you can expect in playlists at different times across the four days of the beta weekend in that post, so peruse at your leisure.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Your  participation in Battlefield 6's first Open Beta weekend across PC,  Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X|S made it a truly unforgettable  experience for the team. We're thrilled by your feedback, and are  focusing on making the October 10th launch even better.</p><p>Looking  back…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955691976130453569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The custom search feature, meanwhile, lets you pick your desired map and mode combos before you start matchmaking, with the game then endeavouring to stick you in a session that mirrors your choices. That's provided such a gun-filled Goldilocks zone is currently out there, and has a free spot. EA also insist that it's "not a server browser," thank you very much.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a long wait, Black Myth: Wukong is finally set to release on Microsoft platforms, so you may now be wondering whether the title will be available on Xbox Game Pass. We’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing August 20th on Xbox Series X|S, Black Myth: Wukong was one of the stand-out games of 2024, making huge waves after launching on PlayStation 5, and was one of the contenders for the Game of the Year title.</p>



<p>12 months after an initial release, Black Myth: Wukong is poised to make its debut on Xbox, and we’ve got the details on whether that includes a Game Pass inclusion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s been a long wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Wukong will not be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 20th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not an Xbox first-party title, and there has not been any announcement on the game coming to the service. As such, this confirms it won’t be included.</p>



<p>Although Xbox has not announced the second wave of August titles coming to the subscription service, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous announcement</a> covering up until the 14th, Black Myth: Wukong will not be one of the titles included. If it was, it would have been a huge surprise and would have been announced well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Black Myth: Wukong Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Black Myth: Wukong will ever be added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, although nothing can be ruled out entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science has close ties with Sony, releasing the title exclusively on PlayStation in August last year, and, while that timed-exclusive period has come to an end, it doesn’t mean the floodgates will open for an addition to the service.</p>



<p>Truthfully, if Black Myth: Wukong were to become available on any subscription service, it would probably be Sony’s PS Plus service. Even then, such an addition is unlikely to happen for a while, given the popularity of the title, so there’s not really any reason for Game Science to secure a deal.</p>

			<p>You have to love indie games. Ideas that probably wouldn’t raise the pulse of the shareholders at Ubisoft or Activision are given the chance to grow and develop, bringing surprises, joy and a range of emotions that their AAA brethren can only hope to emulate. Is This Seat Taken? is the perfect example of this, a cosy puzzler that’s fundamentally about helping people to enjoy where they’re sitting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? – Indie World Showcase 8.7.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQLzRj1E6Ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you arrive in each city, beginning in beautiful Bareclona, you’re given a series of stages where the characters have to be appeased. They’re generally going on a journey, so you have to work on the seating arrangements for the trip, dealing with people who can’t face backwards, have forgotten to wash that day, or desperately want to chat to the person next to them.</p>


<p>The problems arise when other people dislike smells, don’t want to talk, or just want to be on their own, forcing you to think long and hard about where they’re going to sit. As you progress, the demands get greater, the dislikes become more wide ranging, and more and more people want to get on the bus. You’ll find yourself shifting people all over the place, like a game of musical chairs for toddlers who may or may not sit in the nearest chair, for reasons known only to them.</p>


<p>It’s not just buses, but cars, cinemas, gigs, diners and various other places where sitting down is a key part of the experience. Fundamentally, the action, such as it is, is the same for each stage, but the changing setups help to keep things interesting, with different needs such as food and drink, friends, belongings and music coming to the fore based on the context.</p>
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a cosy little view into the human mind. Let’s face it, we’re all a fussy bag of desires and dislikes, and most of the time, we don’t share those with the people we’re put into close proximity with. There’s a key sense of discomfort when you place someone incorrectly, and their face makes sure you know it – I literally couldn’t bring myself to complete a level without achieving a 100% rating. That’s probably made stronger by years working in customer service, but it’s funny to find it so affecting when you’re placing a batch of cartoon shapes into a bus.</p>

<p>Is This Seat Taken? has a simple but lovely art style. Each person is represented by a different shape, and little details such as hats, shoes and earrings to personalise them. The notes you’re given on their needs are also chunky little handwritten lists, with a tickbox to show you’ve got each element right. It’s all enhanced by the chill musical ditties playing in the background, which sit just the right side of elevator music. They don’t distract, instead massaging your clever little brain as you take care of all these needy little shapes.</p>
<p>There’s a few mild foibles to Is This Seat Taken? which take you slightly out of the fiction, not least the food and drink areas where you can sit random people together who’ll dive into the same box of fries or share a cup of coffee. Once you’ve got over that slightly strange fact – made weirder by the notion that people are otherwise <em>so</em> demanding in the game – you can just settle into the calm and enjoyable puzzling. It’s overall not the toughest of games, but everything is so well done that you likely won’t notice.</p>

		<p>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that Crimson Desert will not be released in late 2025, with a new release now expected in early 2026. The game was f<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/11/crimson-desert-pearl-abyss-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-2021-open-world-fantasy/">irst revealed back in 2020</a> with an initial release year of 2021, before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/02/crimson-desert-delayed-new-release-date-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox/">getting delayed in August 2021</a>. The news came from an earnings call (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>). It was less than a year ago when Pearl Abyss released the below trailer giving the late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the earnings call, Pearl Abyss said, <em>“Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market. The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</em></p>
<p><em>The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026. However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</em></p>

<p>In our preview of Crimson Desert, Stefan said, <em>“We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year”</em></p>

<p>The official Battlefield Communications page has acknowledged an issue concerning matchmaking when choosing playlist options in Battlefield 6. The ‘Update 01’ has been deployed in a bid to rectify this, and there’s more details on future measures in the works.</p>



<p>Was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-weekend-2-beta-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Weekend 2</a> ever going to go smoothly without a single problem? Probably not. That’s a testament to the work that Battlefield Studios has put into the game’s testing and marketing. Thousands—potentially millions—of players are desperately trying to log in for the second-week beta. Understandably, there’s a big issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-update-01-drops">Battlefield 6 Update 01 Drops</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Revive matchmaking, please. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battlefield Comms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page has been active since the Weekend 2 beta started. It’s trying to keep players up to speed with bugs and potential hiccups you might encounter.</p>



<p>Matchmaking is proving to be one of the biggest walls we want to blow a hole through, though.</p>



<p>Here’s what Update 01 brings: “If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update. EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair. The team continues to assess this.”</p>



<p>If the problem is happening to you, I recommend trying these methods. The final sentence shows that this is a <em>high priority</em> for the team, and more updates are likely in the works.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Matchmaking Update 01 —

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26.1269861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is here with a fresh slew of content to dig your teeth into, though you won’t be able to get anywhere without the best offensive playbooks. Fortunately for you, that’s where we come in.</p>



<p>Whether your mode of choice is Franchise Mode or Ultimate Team, Superstar Mode or going head-to-head against your friends online, a strong offensive playbook in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> is crucial. Without one, you’ll struggle to find any momentum.</p>



<p>Even if you have the best players in the world, a decent playbook is pivotal to unlocking their full potential. To make things easier for you, we’ve picked out our six favorite offensive playbooks.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-offensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Offensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</h3>



<p>Arguably the best option in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a> for those who want a versatile offence, able to call upon both passing and running plays, the Chicago Bears playbook is incredibly strong. In fact, the only downside is that there are no Pistol plays to call upon, but there’s enough to keep you busy.</p>



<p>If you have a decent slew of receivers and running backs in your team, and you don’t want to rely heavily on one player, the Bears playbook is the perfect choice. With it at your disposal, it will be difficult for any opponent to predict your next move.</p>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>Another option for those who want to rely on short passes, the Green Bay Packers playbook is exceptionally strong. Overall, the Packers have one of the most versatile playbooks in Madden 26, with a wide range of formations to call upon.</p>



<p>Top of the list are the Bunch formation plays, a go-to for many players in the community, and they are the perfect tool in your arsenal for breaking down a tough defence. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</h3>



<p>The New Orleans Saints playbook is the best choice for those who want to rely on short passes, as well as having several options for a mobile quarterback. While it might not be the playbook that dominates highlight reels, it’s effective in getting you moving and is probably the best choice to start with.</p>



<p>Well-balanced with a variety of formations, including Wildcat, there are some deeper plays you can call upon to mix things up. However, the strength is certainly in quick passes and pitches. </p>



<h3 id="h-philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</h3>



<p>The Eagles have been one of the strongest teams in the NFL for years, so it’s hardly surprising that they boast one of the strongest and most versatile playbooks in Madden 26. To unlock the full potential of the playbook, however, you’ll need a strong Tight End in your ranks.</p>



<p>Another strength is the variety of ways you can keep your opponent on their toes, with an array of trick plays to call upon. Even against the toughest defences, the playbook is loaded with options to keep you ahead and leave your opponent on the backfoot.</p>



<h3 id="h-san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</h3>



<p>If you want to lean heavily on a talented running back, the San Francisco 49ers playbook is the one for you. Ideally used when facing a zone defense, this playbook is perfect for finding a receiver in wide open space, or hammering through the defensive line with your running back.</p>



<p>The downside, of course, is the playbook requires a top-class running back, and, without it, you’ll struggle to find momentum. If you’re in Franchise Mode and have that at your disposal, or have packed a top-class running back in Ultimate Team, I highly suggest taking a looking at this option.</p>



<h3 id="h-los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</h3>



<p>Another option for anyone wanting a run-focused offense is the Los Angeles Chargers playbook, with boasts a wide array of Singleback plays. There are also some rather unique plays to call upon to leave your opponents in a spin, though you’ll require decent depth with your running options.</p>



<p>The benefit over the 49ers playbook is a decent chunk of Shotgun plays to call upon, bringing your receivers into the game more and providing greater options when calling plays. </p>



<p>Which playbook has been your go-to in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>!</p>

Industry activists have been campaigning for years to create standardized crediting practices but the problem persists. Many developers still aren't being recognized for their contributions and it is a debilitating issue. It's not just a case of someone not seeing their name in lights. It's a practice that can hamper careers—especially those of industry newcomers who might be asked to prove they've worked on a shipped game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Localization and translation specialist Tamara Morales recently told Game Developer that freelancers, too, rely heavily on credits to bring in more work and show their experience. It's like a resume. Proper crediting is crucial for game workers that have been pushed to the margins, like contract workers or external teams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unions could help standardize the crediting process and guarantee compliance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The struggle for developers to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/developers-anonymous-the-normalisation-and-impact-of-miscrediting-in-games">proper recognition for their work in the industry has been well-documented</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Often, individuals working for external support teams, like localization or quality assurance, will be omitted. Sometimes, studios will leave out the names of people who departed ahead of launch. Improper crediting doesn't always mean a person can't list a project on their resume, but it's—at best—unfair to the developers who worked on the game and aren't credited and, at worst, actively hampering careers. The impact varies from person to person and studio to studio—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hunting-for-the-staff-credits-in">there’s a ton of inconsistency</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—but the problem remains pervasive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/undisputed-developer-steel-city-interactive-opens-leamington-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Undisputed developer Steel City Interactive opens Leamington studio</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Union contracts can deliver 'tangible, positive change across the industry'">Union contracts can deliver 'tangible, positive change across the industry'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nazih Fares, the vice chair of the International Game Developers Association's (IGDA) game credits special interest group, told Game Developer that while working as a public relations contractor for major game companies, they'd been left out of the credits for more than 50 games they supported. Their first game credit for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metal Gear Solid 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a 'special thanks' at the end of the roll call—something that didn't accurately represent the scope of their contributions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When they began specifically asking for credits, they were told the studio that had solicited their services didn't include external developers in their credits. "It was frustrating to be in that situation, and I knew that I wasn't the only one," Fares said. "It wasn't just me."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The IGDA's game credits group </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://igda.org/sigs/credits/">published a lengthy paper on the best practices for game crediting</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2023, which includes standards that define an "inclusive" crediting philosophy.

"I firmly believe that if unions and developers collaborated to embed fair crediting practices—such as the ones we've outlined in the IGDA Game Credits Guidelines—into collective agreements, it would bring tangible, positive change across the industry, globally," Porkka-Kontturi said. "As mentioned, this kind of inclusion in union contracts would not only strengthen the position of workers but also give studios a clear, standardized process to follow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Freelance writer and narrative designer Anna C. Webster also suggested unions can provide a pathway to standardization. "[Credits] are critical," she said. "Being properly credited on a title is essential to our individual careers as workers, and also just general fairness. Being able to say, 'Hey, I worked on this,' is important to show the work you did and not undercut labor in any way."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-fought-hard-raven-qa-union-secures-contract-after-three-years-of-bargaining" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We fought hard:' Raven QA union secures contract after three years of bargaining</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Webster is a member of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/industry-wide-union-uvw-cwa-has-already-welcomed-over-100-new-members">United Video Game Workers-Communications Workers of America's</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (UVW-CWA) organizing committee and the interim chair of the freelancing and contractors issues' committee.

Sega of America's contract, for instance, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/sega-workers-reach-landmark-collective-bargaining-agreement">requires the company to credit all workers that contribute to its games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—including "early QA testers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ZeniMax Workers United has two pages dedicated to crediting practices in its signed contract agreement. It sets out the following attribution guidelines:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">a) The Employer will credit all bargaining unit employees who are assigned (or ancillary) to the title and are employed 90 calendar days before a project’s full public release date. Anyone not employed 90 days minimum before the projected full release date will appear in “Special Thanks”, “Additional Credits” or some other equitable designation.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">b) Bargaining unit employees must work on the title for at least 30 calendar days before the credit lock date. Contributors below this threshold will appear in “Special Thanks”, “Additional Credits” or some other equitable designation.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">c) Bargaining unit employees will be credited by their lived name (first and last) and their role or nature of work at the time credits are created. In the event a bargaining unit employee updates their lived name with Human Resources, the Employer shall then update the publicly accessible list of credits, if available. Changes or updates to in-game credits will be at Management’s discretion.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">d) Credits shall be updated with credit given to those who meet these criteria for additional major releases related to the game (large updates, DLC, etc).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The contract also has a section that lays out the visibility of credits, too. The credits have to be made available to anyone who plays the game, regardless of whether or not they've completed it. There's even a process that outlines how the company must be informed if mistakes are made, and if they want to change how their name appears. (The contract doesn't have any process—aside from being "at the employer’s discretion"—on how people who no longer work there can have theirs changed).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unions, then, have both collective worker power and legal strength to push back on a multitude of issues, including crediting problems. The union has resources that an individual may not, meaning workers don't simply have to trust an internal policy. They can also garner widespread cross-industry support. UVW-CWA, unlike the unions under Sega of America and ZeniMax, is a direct-join union. That means any game worker can join its ranks, regardless of where they work or whether they’re a freelance or contract worker.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">UVW-CWA currently has more than 500 members across the industry in North America and Canada. It works differently in that there isn't a contract between the union and specific companies. Instead, its power comes from the collective voice of members.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The freelancing group under UVW-CWA is looking to create contract standards to help individual workers negotiate crediting terms into their contracts with companies. Webster said the union hasn't nailed down exact language just yet, but explained it could be useful, for instance, to ensure anybody who worked on a game for more than 30 days must be included in the credits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Game developers and publishers could work with unions in drafting a clause in the contract stating that all external collaborators are credited no matter how big or small that collaboration is," Morales added. Crucially, those clauses could be used to hold companies accountable if people are not properly credited. Morales said organizations like ATRAE are working to help people receive proper credits. That includes helping developers contact studios to make them aware of crediting issues in the hopes of delivering a fix.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios don't always comply, but with contracts in hand—or a mass of worker support—that could change.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/video-games-have-a-serious-crediting-problem-but-unions-can-help]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA and Dice have detailed what's changing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Beta in its second week, which kicks off today and runs until 17th August.</p>
<p>Changes are being made to the All-Out Warfare playlist and there is now more control over map and mode selection thanks to custom search. New players will still be able to access training and general gameplay overviews for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Playlists Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>During Week 2, we're delivering more variety and choice for how you’d like to play with more playlists rotating between multiple different game modes. As an example, the All-Out Warfare playlist will include both Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. The in-game descriptions for each mode will tell you which modes are included in the rotation.</p>
<p>Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Search Options</strong></p>
<p>Based on your previous feedback and to give you more control over map and mode selection, we're introducing a new feature called Custom Search.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. Note that this is not a Server Browser (which is not being tested this week).</p>
<p>During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Weekend 2 Playlists Overview</strong></p>
<p>Here is an overview of what the Open Beta Weekend 2 playlists will look like:</p>
<p><strong>Day 1, Thursday 14th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Rush</li>
<li>Attack &amp; Defend (Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2, Friday 15th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Squad Deathmatch</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch)</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3-4, Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conquest</li>
<li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch).</li>
<li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li>
<li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li>
<li>Rotating through playlists daily is specific for the Open Beta while we're still able to test and gather feedback, and is not planned for launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other details to note:</strong></p>
<p>Training Grounds will continue to offer the Firing Range and gameplay introductions for classes, Breakthrough, and Conquest.</p>
<p>Players at career rank 15 and below can access Initiation Mode, which includes AI Soldiers. This initiation experience is tailored for new players and will shift from Breakthrough to Conquest. Separately, there will be a non-playable introduction to Rush as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback and enthusiasm over this weekend. We look forward to seeing how these playlist options work in the matchmaking and the flexibility they offer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 6 releases on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles on 10th October.</p>

            <p>Around a week ago, <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804">146,000 people mourned the death of a horse they'd never met</a>. This might be the best single thing that has ever happened in videogames, although I don't imagine the horse would give a shit. Grass Wonder was a famous Japanese racehorse, but it's likely the majority  of those that mourned his death online are only fans of Japanese horse racing by proxy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/champion-grass-wonder-the-grandsire-of-maurice-dies-at-30">Here is an article about Grass Wonder's death</a> that does not mention <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224770/Umamusume_Pretty_Derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> once. I find this profound and comforting, in the sense that it feels miraculous that such intertwined cultural spheres can still exist in their own siloes. There are people who knew Grass Wonder well, yet would look at you playing the anime horse girl game in wordless confusion, save a muttered directive that you seek the love and light of a forgiving god.</p>
<p>I'm not going to eulogise Grass Wonder because I do not care about Grass Wonder any more than I care about any other horse, and don't especially feel like pretending I do just for the sake of a bit. I think all horses are pretty good but I cannot eulogise them all. But Grass Wonder <em>is </em>special is the sense that Grass Wonder is the horse I'm currently thinking about. Grass Wonder is, as far as I'm concerned, the most famous horse in the world right now. He tramples with disdain over the frail, fallen forms of lesser attention economy aspirants, and from beyond the grave no less.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Again, we can tell from that social post linked above that Pretty Derby has inspired at least 146,000 people that I imagine would not have otherwise known about the existence, never mind death, of Grass Wonder, to spend at least some time this month thinking about his passing. I have not played <a href="https://umamusume.fandom.com/wiki/Grass_Wonder">the horse girl game</a>. Perhaps it has the power to repair my relationship with my own soul, although I'm sceptical. But today, at least, it has conjured for me a reminder that fate has both a sense of humour and a penchant for Gacha mechanics. If the universe is, indeed, a machine for producing ever more potent instances of novelty, it did a fine job with the cultural impact of this racehorse's fatal organ failure.</p><p>According to the article linked above, Grass Wonder "sired 736 winners from 1327 foals". If someone in the comments could enlighten me to whether this is a misprint I would be grateful. Grass Wonder has been breeding for 25 years. If we assume the above to be true, that's about 53 kids a year, or one a week. Goliath-felling levels of mythical dick slinging, that. A real legacy, although Grass Wonder's impact on me will remain the still very notable achievement of making me think about horse dick while writing about videogames. This basically never happens. Oh, maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, actually. Weird that it happened twice, etc.</p>

All development and support for the game will be focused on the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles going forward.</p>
<p>According to the PUBG team, this decision was made to ensure players have a more stable gameplay environment (less crashes) and to improve visuals and performance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>End of Support for PS4 and Xbox One / Transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transition Schedule</strong></p>
<p>During the live server maintenance on November 13, 2025</p>
<p><em>Please note that the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process of each platform. Any updates will be shared separately.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>
<p>After the live server maintenance on November 13, PUBG Console will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will no longer be downloadable or playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Your existing account data and purchased items will be securely preserved. You can log in on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the transition and continue playing with your existing account—no separate transfer process required.</p>
<p>PlayStation users will need to download the PS5 version of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS from the PlayStation Store after November 13 in order to continue playing. Xbox users who already have the game installed will receive the current-gen version automatically via Smart Delivery starting November 13.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Information</strong></p>
<p>Refunds for BATTLEGROUNDS Plus and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will be handled in accordance with each platform's refund policy and procedures. For more details, please contact the customer support team of your respective platform.</p>

<p>Following the transition of PUBG Console to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, the supported specifications will be as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>Xbox Series S</th>
<th>Xbox Series X</th>
<th>PlayStation 5</th>
<th>PlayStation 5 Pro</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Resolution</th>
<td>1080p/1440p</td>

<tr>
<th>FPS</th>
<td>60fps/30fps</td>

<p>Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 Pro support Dynamic 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience. In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly.</p>
<p>As PUBG Console supports cross-play between platforms, fairness across all platforms was one of our top priorities. With this in mind, our goal is to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To account for differences in hardware performance, Xbox Series S will offer selectable options such as Resolution Mode and Performance Mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The life immersion sim inZOI will be releasing on PS5 in 2026, Krafton has announced. The aim is to get the game out in the first half of 2026 and it could be the target is to launch it a year after early access launched on PC, which was in March this year. Krafton has confirmed the PS5 version will be optimised for consoles and it will have the same features as the PC version.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition to the PS5 announcement, Krafton also announced the free Island Getaway DLC, which will add the new location of Cahaya. Cahaya is a location that is based upon South East Asian locations, and it will add new activities such as snorkelling and swimming. There will be two islands to explore in Island Getaway, including a resort island and a main island. Motorcycles and electric scooters will allow players to travel around all locations in the game, and you will also be able to undertake new roles including farming, mining, fishing, and gem crafting. Random gatherings will also take place around the world of inZOI, and there will be new ways to co-operate with other players too. Krafton has also stated that this update will bring limited controller support, which will be in a testing phase.</p>
<p><em>“Cahaya was shaped by feedback from our players, going all the way back to Early Access launch earlier this year,”</em> said Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim, CEO of inZOI Studio and Director of&nbsp;inZOI.<em> “This DLC reflects a vision we’ve built together with our community. Developing a game in a new genre has been a real challenge, but the support we’ve received means everything to us, and we’re just getting started.”</em></p>

<p>The launch of the Island Getaway DLC will coincide with the Mac launch of inZOI on August 20th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-onimusha-way-of-the-sword-playable-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be playable for the first time at Gamescom 2025 next week</a>. The hype among fans is increasing on a daily basis, and the latest round of rumors provided <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by CAPCOM insider Dusk Golem will fuel them even further. According to Dusk Golem, while the game isn't an open world as originally designed, it still has open levels such as Raccoon City and a vehicle is available to travel around them. CAPCOM has reportedly been working hard to improve the performance in those Resident Evil Requiem levels, which bodes well given the issues seen in Monster Hunter Wilds. Lastly, Dusk Golem said that the combat segments with Leon have been enhanced with some elements borrowed from The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p><em>Right now, officially, they've talked about the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (and basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as it required big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, the hair engine from Pragmata. Additionally, we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they've done to behave uniquely and intelligently on the fly. There's a few other innovations, some I know, but also, sure, I don't know all of them. A small handful I don't mind sharing is they've been working hard to achieve having good performance on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along with a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly, some The Last of Us Part 2-isms, but also its own innovations.</em></p>



<p><em>There's been an effort to provide more environmental physics systems and interactivity for Grace's segments where she has to work with the environment more, and balance light and darkness. And more I won't say, and sure more I don't know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that, at this time, Resident Evil Requiem only has one official protagonist, FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft, who is sent to investigate a series of strange deaths at the Raccoon City hotel where her mother died eight years ago. However, CAPCOM has often kept other playable protagonists quiet throughout the series, so it wouldn't be too much of a surprise if the Leon rumor turned out to be true.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>Hey, Agent 47. That's a really nice scarf. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is getting written about a lot these days so I'm seeing quite a few screenshots of buildings being blown up. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to have developed a visceral distaste for images of buildings being blown up recently. At times like these, it's nice to look at a nice scarf.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It feels grandiose and a little paranoid to relate those images of bombed-out structures to part of a larger cultural project of desensitisation, although I'm not <em>not </em>struck temporarily mute and reeling and a touch nauseous at the moment we find ourselves in, in which art about love is reframed as pornography, too vile to touch, and in which art that conjures and celebrates reminders of contemporary global suffering fades so routinely into the normal order of things. More than normal. Hot property. Hot like chapped dehydrated lips under a cruel sun. Hot like fire from the sky.</p>
<p>So, as I say, it's nice just to see a lovely scarf. Helps take the mind off things, you know?</p>
<p>I can see that you're enjoying that scarf, too, Agent 47. Don't lose focus, though. You almost missed that security camera!</p>

<p>You have to take out the cameras first, 47. It's just good business, taking out the cameras, right before you do something too vile for words. Oh, right. News. Yes. IO Interactive recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7356956984207630336">hired a new writer on World Of Asssasination</a> in former Edge editor Jen Simpkins, which likely means we'll be getting more substantial updates that I'd previously assumed, lining up with IO's promises that Hitman isn't completely wrapped up as they move on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>. This is a videogame news piece on a videogame website. You can't say it isn't.</p>

		<p>Sports Interactive and SEGA has released a new teaser for Football Manager 26, the next football manager game that will be released after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled-to-focus-on-fm-26/">Football Manager 25 was cancelled earlier this year.</a> This new video gives us a glimpse at some in game footage of the Football Manager 26’s match day experience, including a tease of player walk outs. There is also a focus on the Premier League branding, which has been officially licensed for the new release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | GUESS WHO'S BACK | #FM26" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faFwhGRwLCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This has been a very bumpy journey for Sports Interactive and its long running Football Manager series. The cancellation of Football Manager 25 was the first time a game in the series had ever been cancelled, and the main reason for this was the shift from the old engine to Unity to provide a more up to date gameplay experience. Football Manager 25 was meant to incorporate women’s football, but it was going to cut &nbsp;Sports Interactive also announced some features were set to be removed from FM25, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. It is not yet clear if these modes will be in Football Manager 26.</p>
<p>While there is no release date for Football Manager 26 yet, it would be expected to follow previous games in the series and launch at some point in November, so players can play through the 2025/26 season and beyond. Sports Interactive has stated more information will be coming soon about what to expect in Football Manager 26.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-%E2%80%98fox-hunt%E2%80%99-multiplayer-mode-launches-in-fall-with-no-crossplay.1269816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KONAMI announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox Hunt</a>, the multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, will be available sometime in the Fall season. However, there's also some bad news: the official Japanese account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1955585126286377462%7Ctwgr%5E73386f46dba965f7676b994d8eff39cf2cc05419%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that there will be no crossplay in Fox Hunt. </p>



<p>This is less than ideal, to say the least, especially for a multiplayer mode that launches after launch. Most players might have already forgotten about it by the time Fox Hunt becomes available. Some fans are already worried that the mode could be 'dead on arrival', although that's way too early to say. </p>



<p>Fox Hunt has been heavily inspired by the fan-favorite Metal Gear Online, as outlined in the mode's official description: </p>



<p><em>A thrilling, hide-and-seek-based, completely original online multiplayer experience. This unique Metal Gear online experience utilizes the central elements of the base game: camouflage and survival.</em></p>



<p><em>It is based on the Sneaking rule from METAL GEAR ONLINE. It utilizes the fundamentals of one of the most popular game rules from METAL GEAR ONLINE, as well as the iconic sneaking gameplay elements of the METAL GEAR series. The latest graphical enhancements amplify the tension of hide-and-seek to a whole new level.</em></p>



<p>Still, this is really just an extra. The main course will be the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, which fans of the series have been waiting for a long time. Developed with the help of Virtuos (which also took care of the Oblivion Remaster) in Unreal Engine 5, MGS: Delta Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to debut in exactly two weeks</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game features a few quality-of-life improvements, such as a modern control scheme (although the original is optionally available, too), but the original's core experience remains intact. We'll soon learn if it stands the test of time.</p>

<p>Nintendo recently updated its music app on mobile devices, and this week it has released a new update for its Switch Parental Controls app.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 Could Be Getting a ‘Surprisingly Big’ Update Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-could-be-getting-a-%E2%80%98surprisingly-big%E2%80%99-update-soon.1269792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested on social media that Battlefield 2042, the most recent game in the series to hit the open market, will get a ‘surprisingly big’ content update soon. It was theorized that this could be the final update to hit the Battlefield 2042 platform before Battlefield 6 is released worldwide on October 10.</p>



<p>The claimed update that comes from ‘Temporyal’ on social media includes a new map, three new weapons, and two new vehicles being broken out of the Battlefield Vault.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-s-final-content-update">Battlefield 2042’s Final Content Update</h2>



<p>With Battlefield 6 sitting tantalizingly close on that horizon, Battlefield 2042 is preparing to become a forgotten thing of the past. In a new post on social media, prolific dataminer ‘Temporyal’ claimed that a ‘surprisingly big’ update is headed to Battlefield 2042, and that it might be <strong>the final update</strong> for the game, content-wise.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 2042 may be getting a surprisingly big (maybe final?) content update soon.</p><p>New Map:<br>🇯🇵 Iwo Jima</p><p>New Weapons:<br>🤫 The Prototype (“Riverdweller”)<br>🔫 KFS2000 (FN F2000)<br>🎯 GM6 Lynx</p><p>New Vault Vehicles:<br>🇺🇸 A-10 Warthog<br>🇷🇺 SU-25TM Frogfoot</p><p>🪖 Pax Armata-themed cosmetics <a href="https://t.co/vvZ3P4uhUl">pic.twitter.com/vvZ3P4uhUl</a></p></div>— temporyal (@temporyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/temporyal/status/1955701622660591897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Iwo Jima is a setting we’ve seen before in the Battlefield world, even if it seems a little out of left field for Battlefield 2042 (and Battlefield 6, for that matter).</p>



<p>The suggestion that this update includes Pax Armata is interesting. It almost guarantees it’ll drop soon, as Pax Armata is the antagonist faction in Battlefield 6, and this would be Electronic Arts fuelling the hype for the next game by bleeding it into Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>I’m personally more interested in the return of the SU-25TM and the A-10. They’re timeless classics in the Battlefield space, and raking the ground with fire from the Warthog’s auto-cannon never gets old.</p>



<p><strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT</strong>.</p>



<p>Temporyal explained a little more about the Pax Armata cosmetics by offering a description from a datamined bundle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A new way of warfare has been born, and that requires soldiers trained for the task. Pax Armata intends to change the world – will you join their ranks or become one of the conquered?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you eager to see the back of Battlefield 2042, or are you intent on enjoying this potentially final content update? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong>Kang Dong Yeon, Director:</strong> “Hello, I’m Kang Dong Yeon, director of <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em>.</p><p><strong>Mok Youngmi, Art Director: “</strong>Hi, I’m Mok Youngmi, art director of Woochi the Wayfarer.”</p><p><strong>What kind of project is this?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “We are LoreVault, a name that means ‘a vault of stories.’ <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em> is an action-adventure game we’re creating here at LoreVault. It combines a moving, memorable story with a richly imagined Joseon-era setting, and the thrilling battle action of a ‘Dosa(the Mage of the Way).'”</p><p><strong>What is the setting of the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Internally, we call it ‘Joseon fantasy.’ We’re building a world based on historical research, blending in imaginative and fantastical elements to enrich the gameplay. You’ll meet characters from Korean myths—‘Dosa’, Dokkaebi, Gumiho, and more from this fusion period drama.”</p><p><strong>What does the title mean?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “As the title suggests, the hero is Woochi, a legendary ‘Dosa’ well-known among Korean gamers. At its core, the story follows Woochi during his training to become a ‘Dosa.’ The game is built around the adventures he experiences on that journey. We felt it was important for the title to symbolically capture the hero’s identity, story, and goals. After exploring various possibilities to express all these aspects, we decided on the title <em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em>. Since we’re aiming for a global release, we chose an English title to feel more approachable to players worldwide.”</p><p><strong>How does this differ from the original Woochi?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Woochi’s story has many traditional versions, which makes him open to broad interpretation. We want to capture his existing charm, while adding our own vision—creating something distinct from films or TV dramas. We blend traditional Korean looks like gat, hanbok, and dorongi with fantasy elements to create our unique version of Woochi.”</p><p><strong>What type of game is this?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “The game is a story-driven single-player title with combat. With our story, we aim to leave players with a lasting emotional impact by the time they reach the ending. Of the various storytelling methods, we especially focus on delivering the narrative through striking cinematic direction. Equally important, we aim to deliver thrilling combat scenes in many forms, creating a game that’s just as fun to play.”</p><p><strong>Does the game have a dark tone or atmosphere?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “We didn’t set out to make it dark, but the characters and environments shown so far have a heavier tone, which might have given that impression. In reality, the game’s core atmosphere is bright, colorful, and warm. We believe these vibrant colors and inviting tone will clearly distinguish us from other East Asian fantasy titles. To give you a sense of the atmosphere, we’ve prepared a short in-game clip—though the visuals are not yet final.”</p><p><strong>Does the magpie wearing a gat actually appear in the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “Yes, it will. When we saw <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>, we were genuinely surprised—and delighted. We could tell the creators had done a lot of research, and we really related to that. While some motifs may overlap, our game will feature a far more realistic and adorable magpie, as well as a majestic tiger. We can’t share too much without spoiling the story, but the shaman character ‘Myoan’ from our teaser will also appear in the game.”</p><p><strong>What did you want to convey through the teaser video?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Every shot in the teaser was created using actual in-game assets. We aimed to capture scenes exactly as they appear in-game, so the video could convey the real mood and quality of the title. We’re using 3D scanning and <a title="Platforms > Meta [148 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>Human-based facial work to create lifelike characters with an immersive presence. By presenting high-quality versions of distinctly Korean elements such as the magpie, the shaman, and the ‘Dosa,’ we wanted to highlight the game’s identity.”</p><p><strong>What’s the story behind the magpie wearing a gat?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “In the video, the magpie copies a scholar’s look, wearing a gat it crafted from twigs. I personally find it quite cute.”</p><p><strong>When will the game be released?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “The video we’ve released this time is an announcement teaser. This teaser is meant not only to showcase our project to players, but also to appeal to fellow developers. While the release date is still undecided, we’ll keep sharing updates as development progresses.”</p><p><strong>What are the strengths and challenges of using the Joseon era as the game’s setting?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “One of our big advantages is easy access to reference materials, such as lifestyle, architecture, clothing, and food. We also take inspiration from exploring real Korean landscapes, which has been incredibly helpful. For many on our team, this is their first time working this way, and they’re really enjoying it. The challenge is finding the right balance between accuracy and fantasy. Because the Joseon era was a real period in our history, accuracy and responsibility matter. At the same time, imagination and creativity are key to gameplay. So we’re always discussing what to portray realistically and what to reinterpret. When it comes to mythical creatures from folklore, reference images are often scarce or nonexistent. That makes them tricky to design, but also makes it exciting—we get to bring them to life through our own interpretation.”</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for developers interested in this project?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “This is a particularly challenging genre to take on in Korea. so we actively seek people with a bold, adventurous mindset. And because we’re making a single-player package game, a dream for many developers, we especially welcome those with a passion for this kind of project.”</p><p><strong>How can developers join the project?</strong></p><p><strong>Yeon:</strong> “If you click the link below this video, you’ll be taken to the Nexon Games careers page. There, you can search for ‘LoreVault’ or ‘Woochi’ in English to find information about open positions.”</p><p><strong>Do you have a message for developers interested in this project?</strong></p><p><strong>Youngmi:</strong> “Being able to capture the beauty of Korea in our game is such a unique advantage, and anyone who joins our studio will find it enjoyable. If you’re interested in or knowledgeable about the Joseon era, we’d be thrilled to have you join us. We’ll continue to share news as we go. Thank you for your interest and support.”</p></div><p><em>Woochi the Wayfarer</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,679 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,900 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.

<p>When Raw Thrills released Cruis'n Blast on Switch in 2021, we called it a hugely entertaining arcade-style racer, awarding it eight out of ten stars.</p>
<p>Much like Cruis'n Blast, Fast &amp; Furious: Arcade Edition also features licensed cars and includes all kinds of action-packed sequences. As noted in the press release and video above, racers can look forward to split-screen multiplayer as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hit the road in legendary cars including the Dodge Charger, Corvette Z06, Shelby GT500 KR, Ford GT, Bronco DR, Jeep Wrangler and more - plus customize your car with unique color schemes.</p>
<p>Race through each of the original arcade game’s tracks solo or in split-screen with a friend and discover destructible environments, branching paths, and sneaky shortcuts that can shake up any race and reward risk-takers. Take on thrilling challenges with high-stakes objectives like intercepting a missile in the Swiss Alps or grounding a plane in the heart of Hong Kong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The press package also includes a look at a European physical Switch release. It mentions how this is a "download code only".</p>

                <p>After adding two-player expeditions in the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, From Software's latest patch is adding some balance adjustments to the powerful abilities that come with the legendary sword known as Storm Ruler.</p><p>Going forward, it won't take as long to charge the storm effect and the animation speed of the blade will be faster. Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations. Performance issues appear to have been the main problems addressed in the patch, but there were others as well, including a bug that prevented some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign Caligo, Miasma of Night from hitting other players.</p><p>There was also one bug fix that specific to PlayStation 5, where both the user interface and the heads-up display might disappear for players. That bug might be followed by the game crashing altogether if players attempted to continue playing.</p><p>What's coming next for Nightreign after this patch? A recent datamine suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/" data-ref-id="1100-6533778">a ranked mode may be debuting on Nightreign</a> in the future. Last month, Bandai Namco and From Software announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">Nightreign has shipped 5 million copies</a> since its debut at the end of May.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-confirmed-for-switch-2/1100-6530541/" data-ref-id="1100-6530541">Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year, which will include the base game and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. There's also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-movie-director-is-more-than-familiar-with-the-game/1100-6532534/" data-ref-id="1100-6532534">live-action Elden Ring movie in development from A24 with Alex Garland slated to direct.</a></p><p>The complete patch notes for Elden Ring Nightreign version 1.02.1 are included below.</p><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Increased the performance of the skill "Storm Ruler"</li><li>Reduced the time to charge the storm effect</li><li>Increased the speed of the blade unleashed by the attack</li><li>Increased the attack power when not charged with the storm</li></ul><h3>Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, using dropped items would prevent any actions other than moving and camera operation.</li><li>Fixed a bug where effects triggered by successful guards would not activate for certain guard actions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where target lock would immediately be released on eggs or insects parasitizing the player character when Duchess's Ultimate Art "Finale" effect is active.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks by Everdark Sovereign "Maris, Fathom of Night" would cause stagger damage when negated with the Executor's Skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, the relic effect "[Executor] While Character Skill is active, unlocking use of cursed sword restores HP" would not activate.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the skill "Storm Ruler" could be used without consuming FP by specific steps.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the damage dealt to enemies by the passive effect "Frostbite Produces a Mist of Frost" was higher than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where using a Flask would not heal the player's own HP when equipped with relics that have the effect "Flask Also Heals Allies".</li><li>Note: We have identified a bug where healing is not distributed or the amount of healing distributed changes for allies who have acquired the passive effect "Gradual Restoration by Flask." This will be fixed in a future update.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the displayed effect value of "Extended Spell Duration" differed from the actual effect value.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the color of effects generated by certain Passive Effects was different than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign, “Caligo, Miasma of Night,” would not hit playable characters.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the framerate would drop during battles with Everdark Sovereigns "Caligo, Miasma of Night" and "Maris, Fathom of Night" under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the number of displayed relics did not match the actual number shown when sorting by "Order by Size" or "Order by Color" in the Relic Rites menu.</li><li>Fixed a bug where certain relics could not be equipped when using specific filter functions in the Relic Rites menu.</li><li>Fixed a bug where, under certain conditions, audio may not play correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where continuous use of Sorceries and Incantations would degrade game performance for other players.</li><li>Fixed a bug where activating certain passive effects or continuous use of Sorceries and Incantations could impact network stability.</li><li>Corrected some texts in Brazilian Portuguese.</li></ul><h3>Only for PS5 Bug Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the UI, including the HUD, would disappear and the game might unexpectedly terminate if play were continued.</li></ul>
