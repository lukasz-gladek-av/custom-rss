			<p>A little more than four years ago, <strong>John Gibson</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role as CEO and co-founder of <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong></a> following a controversy sparked by his tweet supportive of the <strong>Texas Heartbeat Act</strong>, which banned abortions in the state after the detection of embryonic or fetal cardiac activity.</p>



<p>For a while, Gibson, who started as a programmer on the <strong>America's Army</strong> series (developed and published by the <strong>US Army</strong>) and then went on to co-found the studio known mainly for Red Orchestra and Killing Floor, remained out of the games industry. That changed around two years ago, when he started consulting for <strong>Bible X</strong>, the studio behind the Christian-based game project <strong>Gate Zero</strong>. Last month, Gibson, through his recently established publisher <strong>Templar Media</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the developer</a>.</p>



<p>I recently interviewed him to discuss the investment and the game itself, although we started with an explanation of Templar Media's slogan: <strong>"Entertainment First."</strong> Gibson wants to deliver games that focus on the fun factor rather than pushing a political agenda, as he said games (and other media) have been doing lately. </p>



<p><em>I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year.  After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. <strong>I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, "Entertainment First," originated.</strong> I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] <strong>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. </strong></em></p>



<p>Later, the former Tripwire executive referenced <strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</strong> specifically, where the <strong>Qu'nari</strong> companion <strong>Taash</strong> eventually transitions to non-binary and has a significant discussion with their mother, <strong>Shathann</strong> (an NPC), about it during a personal quest.</p>



<p><em>When I was growing up, movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones or games like Zelda and Metroid were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. <strong>For example, in the new Dragon Age game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people.</strong> While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</em></p>

			<p>A UK judge has denied 31 former <strong>Rockstar</strong> employees' bid for interim pay as they and their union representation, the <strong>Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB)</strong>, fight their dismissal and are accusing Rockstar of <strong>union-busting</strong>.</p>



<p>If their interim bid pay had been granted, then Rockstar would have been mandated to put the 31 employees back on the payroll while the legal battle between the employees and Rockstar raged on. The ruling to deny the interim pay bid comes from a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2ODI0NzI2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY4ODUyMDYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUOFJPOVVLSVVQU1owMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.27VI473B4UvIhmPh6eOoW2Crg7Pem9jtOtoGNX34Bco">Bloomberg</a>, which reports that after a two-day tribunal last week, Judge Frances Eccles felt that the IWGB and the fired workers had not successfully met the bar to demonstrate they had a "<em>pretty good chance of success</em>" at convincing the tribunal of Rockstar's alleged union-busting.</p>



<p>"<em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>," Eccles wrote in their ruling.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-Feature-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CWA Canada representatives, local game developers, academics, and their friends came together to show solidarity with the 34 workers fired from Rockstar. Pictured: Jim Munroe, co-founder of Toronto Games Week.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year, Rockstar fired 34 employees (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">31 in the UK and three in Canada</a>) at the end of October 2025, with the news breaking and initial union-busting accusations flying at the beginning of November 2025. Rockstar shot back at the accusations, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">claiming the workers were fired for leaking confidential information,</a> which Rockstar would later claim included "<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><em>specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</a></p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">The IWGB filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">employees asked for reinstatement</a>, while protests began to appear in physical and digital forms, with game developers both within and outside of Rockstar and Take-Two taking to protesting at Rockstar and Take-Two offices and <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">over 200 Rockstar North employees signing an open letter to management</a> calling for the reinstatement of their colleagues.</p>



<p>An anonymous employee claiming to have knowledge of the situation came forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">claim that Rockstar's accusations are false and that this is a clear case of union-busting on Rockstar's part</a>, and the issue has since been brought to the UK parliament twice, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer speaking on it the second time, calling the accusations "<em>deeply concerning</em>."</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rockstar-Toronto-Protest-6-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Pictured: Protestors outside of Rockstar Toronto</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The alleged leaking of confidential information is said to have taken place in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">a Discord server used by the IWGB and Rockstar employees for the purposes of organizing</a>. Initially, the IWGB claimed that Rockstar was trying to call employees discussing internal Slack policy changes in that Discord server, the 'leak' of confidential information. A claim that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">corroborated by one of the three employees fired from Rockstar Toronto when Wccftech spoke to them, CWA Canada, and other protestors who demonstrated at the Rockstar Toronto offices in December 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Though Rockstar alleges it was more than just the discussion of Slack policies, today's ruling from Eccles does seem to clear up a few unanswered questions about the Discord server in question. Eccles' ruling confirms that the server, which includes 350 members, was, as advertised, used for organizing, but that it also included more than just current Rockstar employees and IWGB staff. </p>



<p>Eccles cites that beyond the three Canadian workers who were not part of the IWGB union, the server did include former Rockstar staff who did not leave the server after having left the company, and it even included one person who Bloomberg describes as someone who "<em>writes articles about the video-game industry</em>."</p>



<p>When Wccftech asked the fired Rockstar Toronto worker about the server, who spoke to us under anonymity, they claimed that if there were people in the server who were no longer at Rockstar, they had "<em>no idea</em>" of their presence, adding, "<em>everyone I've ever spoken to [in that server] was a current employee</em>."</p>



<p>Eccles' ruling also points out that there were other organizing members within the server who were not fired, though, in a point against Rockstar, Judge Eccles also noted that some of the employees who were fired were dismissed despite "<em>having posted very little on the Discord server</em>."</p>



<p>Rockstar, for its part, says, "<em>We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing</em>." Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, the IWGB is "<em>more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/rockstar-wins-initial-ruling-against-fired-gta-6-devs-we-regret-that-we-were-put-in-a-position-where-dismissals-were-necessary-2000658984</link>
            <guid>1403980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-union-busting-firing-keir-starmer-2000652135">30 fired Rockstar Games employees</a> have lost a request for interim relief following an ongoing fight with the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker. A UK employment tribunal ruling read that it “was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB,” meaning the legal battle will continue with no immediate back pay for the fired developers. The union representing them says it’s undeterred while a spokesperson for Rockstar said the company regrets being put in this situation and maintains the employees were fired for leaking confidential information.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">The dispute revolves around a Discord</a> set up by the IWGB to help organize union video game developers. Rockstar says it fired 31 UK developers last year for disclosing company secrets in the channel, including information related to development schedules and game features. IWGB has denied that any sensitive info was leaked and claims the firings infringed on employees’ labor rights and are tantamount to union-busting.</p>

 <p>According to employment Judge Frances Eccles’ initial ruling, the Discord channel included around 350 members, including former Rockstar employees, at least one of whom had <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">previously published articles</a> about the company online. A spokesperson for Rockstar pointed out that there were current employees who shared support for unionizing in the Discord and who weren’t fired, stressing that the terminations were specifically for mishandling of company information.</p>

 <p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout,” a spokesperson for Rockstar told <em>Kotaku</em> in an emailed statement. “We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</p>

 <h2>Rockstar accused of spying on fired devs</h2> <p>But the IWGB says the ruling highlights that Rockstar failed to follow procedural guidelines when firing the employees, with no disciplinary meetings, investigations, or chances to appeal the company’s findings internally. It also accused Rockstar of “covertly monitoring” employees on the Discord by “impersonating” a union staff member. And the organization points to a part of the judge’s ruling that reads “There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” as evidence that Rockstar overreacted.</p>

 <p>“Despite being refused interim relief today, we’ve come out of last week’s hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful,” IWGB president Alex Marshall said in a statement emailed to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “The fact that we were granted this hearing speaks to the strength of our case and, over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures.”</p>

 <p>The case will now continue to be argued before the tribunal for a full finding which could have important implications for whether the studio behind one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world becomes unionized. Whatever the outcome, it seems likely to be decided before<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em> ships later this year in November.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO Says AI “Doomer Narrative” Is “Hurtful”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/</link>
            <guid>1403944</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants everyone to stop being so negative about AI. </p>



<p>The head of the company with the $4.502 trillion market cap—the highest in the world—feels that people spreading a “doomer narrative” are only doing harm to the industry.</p>







<p>Speaking on a recent episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xtmISBCNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">No Priors podcast</a>, Huang was asked about the idea of “God AI” and the stigma that’s surround the growth of the technology as a whole. </p>



<p>Regarding God AI, Huang doesn’t see researchers “having any reasonable ability to create god AI.” </p>



<p>“The ability&nbsp;to understand human language, genome language, and molecular language and protein language and amino-acid language and physics language all supremely well—that god AI just doesn’t exist,” he says. </p>



<p>He continues to say that there are a lot of industries that “need” AI, which he calls “just the next computer industry”. Huang says that while this God AI isn’t coming next week or next year, the “whole world needs to move forward next week, next year, next decade.”</p>



<p><strong>“I think that the idea of a monolithic, gigantic company, country, nation-state is just…super unhelpful, it’s too extreme,” </strong>he said. <strong>“If you want to take it to that level, we should just stop everything…what’s the point?”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-continued-fear-of-ai">A Continued Fear Of AI</h2>



<p>With the growth of AI continuing at a rapid pace, there are many people out there who are completely against the idea. Whether it be for the fear of losing jobs or the ability to create believable falsehoods, you don’t have to go far to find someone with a negative opinion on the technology. </p>



<p>To that notion, Huang feels that the constant negativity from the general public and prominent figures has been <strong>“extremely hurtful”.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think we’ve done a lot of damage lately with very well-respected people who have painted a doomer narrative, end of the world narrative, science fiction narrative,”</strong> he said. <strong>“And I appreciate that most of us grew up enjoying science fiction, but it’s not helpful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“It’s not helpful to people, it’s not helpful to the industry, it’s not helpful to society, it’s not helpful to the governments.”</strong></p>







<p>Huang then continued to question what the purpose of that type of narrative and what the intentions are of those who spread it. </p>



<p>Of course, the feeling around AI is going to continue to be division both in the general population and within the games industry. Just recently, the use of generative AI resulted in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seeing its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award at the Indie Game Awards</a> stripped away. </p>

            <p>
It feels quite fitting that a game like Big Hops released today, the day after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a> wrapped up, because this thing feels like it has a guaranteed spot in Summer Games Done Quick already. You're a frog! Who hops around! What's not to love? It helps that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> feels so good in motion, too.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard of Big Hops before let me give you the proper run down. You play as Hop (get it?), a happy-go-lucky frog that is fooled into unleashing a mischievous spirit called Diss that I was half convinced was voiced by Elijah Wood for a minute (but is actually voiced by the very talented Ben Diskin, hey there Young Xehanort). Big Hops is very much a game that would not exist without, well, any 3D Mario, but it isn't beholden to those games either.

There's no triple jump, at least in the demo, but there is a crouch jump. There's some wall bouncing, but more critically there's some Breath of the Wildian wall climbing, complete with a stamina bar. And of course there's tongue swinging, rolling, mid-air dashing, a real mish-mash of original and borrowed ideas that have been cooked up into a game that feels incredibly tight, speedy, and most importantly of all, bouncy.
</p><p>
I like the sillier elements, like catching bugs with said tongue, giving them a good inspection before adding them to your collection. The environments feel neatly designed too, no wasted space, secrets to be found, and colours that make a nice meal for the eyes. It is a game I cannot describe as anything but delightful, and I look forward to finding the time to play the actual game, somewhere amongst the mess that is life!

Still, a small cluster of fans had been tracking Anthem's final hours, and a few dozen had been playing the game on Twitch to see out its final moments. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At around 10.03am Pacific, in-game players reported getting suddenly booted as the plug was pulled. After warnings of a connection problem, players were left sitting back on the Anthem's startup screen, showing the game's logo and its characters — now left to forever tinker with their amored Javelin suits, which will never fly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of all the dead live games, this is one of the most painful, as the game was so very close to greatness," wrote Anthem fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Com_Raven/status/2010807200458117385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcel Hatam</a> on X/Twitter. "Great core gameplay with fun combat and flying, an intriguing world and great customization. Freelancer signing off 🫡."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Damn wanted to get a few more hours before closure, sad," wrote new fan Regis via BioWare's Discord, who said they'd only given Anthem a try this month after learning it was shutting down. "Got to play the game for just a week but it already leaves a hole in my chest."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/12/playing-anthem-until-the-servers-shut-down-01-33-45-1768250034127.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">BioWare's Anthem, 2019 - 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem launched in February 2019 to lukewarm reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">including IGN's own</a>, which criticized the game's grindiness, lack of polish and mismatched story. The game sold more than 5 million copies but failed to meet EA's own internal targets, set after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bioware-executive-producer-breaks-down-what-really-happened-to-anthem">long and troubled development</a>. Despite some effort to further update and improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">BioWare ceased active development on Anthem back in February 2021</a>, citing a need to prioritize Dragon Age: The Veilguard (which launched in late 2024 to its own set of mixed feedback) and Mass Effect 5 (which is still seemingly years away).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem publisher EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced last year that it would stop running the game's servers today</a>, and confirmed that users would no longer be able play at all after this point. Premium in-game currency was withdrawn from sale last summer, and the game was delisted at the same time from EA Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An online-only action RPG spread across a large multiplayer map, Anthem had no offline option — meaning that the game's world, characters and lore are now officially gone for good. But as IGN reported last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-biowares-failed-live-service-anthem-gets-ready-to-die-players-rush-to-unlock-platinums-and-say-their-goodbyes-while-others-work-on-custom-servers">there are fledgling efforts underway by fans to bring Anthem back online via custom servers</a>, though it is too early to tell exactly how far this option might progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1403914</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">An employment tribunal has today rejected an application for interim relief filed on behalf of the fired Grand Theft Auto 6 developers at Rockstar Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Glasgow Employment Tribunal released the outcome of the hearing today, rejecting all applications for interim relief. “We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout," a Rockstar Games spokesperson told IGN. “We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which had accused Rockstar of “union-busting,” asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK last week. Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. If the interim relief had been granted, the workers would have been put back on Rockstar’s payroll and had their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the ruling, Judge Eccles said that of the approximately 350 members of the IWGB Discord, over half were members of the IWGB, but some were no longer employed by Rockstar Games. One member was said to have written press articles about video games, including at least one that commented on Rockstar and the development of GTA. Judge Eccles added that because Rockstar dismissed three employees in Canada who were not members of the union, their union membership could not have been a factor in their dismissal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to information provided to IGN by a Rockstar Games spokesperson, the ruling indicates that Judge Eccles believes that the IWGB is not “likely” to show that union activity or membership was the reason for their dismissal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord John Hendy KC, who represents the fired developers, argued it was not “gross misconduct” to share confidential information in a group containing external third parties, even as a matter of principle, but Rockstar insisted this claim was not credible. Lord Hendy KC also suggested there was ‘no leak’ of information, at best only a ‘risk’ of leak. However, Rockstar said that posting confidential information in a public forum constitutes a 'leak’ because that information was shared with people outside of Rockstar, including individuals who work at competitors and with journalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize"><u>as it has said before</u></a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the alleged leaked information, Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the overall progress of GTA 6 development, timelines to launch, and company IT security protocols. Rockstar believes that if the comments in question had leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</u></a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking. Rockstar said that many of the claimants accepted in the Discord server that their comments might not have aligned with Rockstar’s policies on confidentiality and security, which it believes to be a sign they were aware of the company’s zero-tolerance approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB issued IGN with a lengthy statement in response to the ruling:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The judge’s decision - that Rockstar will not be forced into providing emergency support to our members whilst they await trial - is disappointing but does nothing to dampen our hopes of winning justice when the full hearing takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In fact, we are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar’s flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful. The judge stated in her ruling that: ‘There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was also highlighted in the ruling that many procedural guidelines were broken in the process of firing these employees, including there being no disciplinary meetings, no chance for appeal until six weeks later, and no evidence of an investigation. Comments relied on by Rockstar’s lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have always been clear that Interim Relief is an incredibly high bar to meet as a temporary measure before the substantive tribunal, and it would have been almost unprecedented for a Judge to award this to a group of this size. That we did not secure an interim relief order means the especially stringent conditions required for this kind of hearing were not met, but does nothing to suggest that Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The facts of the matter remain shocking, such as how Rockstar management have now admitted to covertly monitoring their employees on this private Discord by impersonating a member of staff. Rather than focusing their case on evidence that Rockstar acted fairly and reasonably in their decision to fire 31 people on the spot, the argument resided largely on legal technicalities, with Rockstar's lawyers declaring that it doesn’t matter if the dismissals were unfair, or if the leadership that dismissed them acted with malice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Such an approach is wholly in keeping with what we already know of Rockstar’s utter disregard for the people whose creativity and hard work deliver its billions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain confident in the strength of our case against Rockstar Games and we reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 union members. We look forward to the day we face them in court."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex Marshall, President of the IWGB added: "Despite being refused interim relief today, we’ve come out of last week’s hearing more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar’s calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful. The fact that we were granted this hearing speaks to the strength of our case and, over the course of the two-day hearing, Rockstar consistently failed to back up claims made in the press or to refute that they acted unfairly, maliciously, and in breach of their own procedures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They’ve shown their hand and also shone a light on their own callousness and incompetence. Given the outpouring of public support over the last few months, from Paris to New York, the world knows that Rockstar is in the wrong and their disregard for workers will cast a long shadow over the release of GTA6. This hearing could have alleviated the hardships faced by those in financial precarity or forced to leave the country as a result of Rockstar’s actions but we remain undeterred in our efforts to hold them to account."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB also provided a statement attributed to a former Rockstar employee: "This decision to fail to award IR is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless uncaring employer’s quest to crush a trade union. We’ll continue the fight to clear our names, regain our jobs and put an end to this chapter of our lives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Throughout all this, the bonds we have made with those who were unlawfully fired have kept us all strong. The kindness, compassion and dedication we have all shown to each other is heartwarming and a reminder that we are all fighting for workers rights. This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar’s behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Union busting has consequences!

            <guid>1403911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Peter Molyneux, the mind behind the Fable series, Populous, and Black &amp; White, announced his next game, Masters of Albion, during <a href="https://youtu.be/CSLGKKAuZwo?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB">Gamescom 2024</a>. His next – and final – game is coming to PC on April 22.</p><p>Masters of Albion comes from Molyneux’s studio, 22 Cans, and blends elements of real-time strategy, town management, and simulation to an experience Molyneux describes as “the culmination of my life’s work,” in a press release. Players take on the role of a powerful god possessing a “god hand” capable of designing and building entire villages from the ground-up.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/joy9aDGawTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Buildings can be customized, and different types of structures can be combined to form new building types. As you lord over your human citizens, you can manipulate them via possession, inspire them with divine acts, or punish them using abilities such as weather manipulation and more. Masters of Albion does not feature timers or waiting, allowing players to rule their worlds at their own pace. You can explore Albion from the heavens, control humans or animals such as dogs and chickens to take in the sights on foot. Players can complete quests to unlock treasures and secrets, or explore hidden areas to uncover the secret history of Albion.</p><p>When night falls, the gameplay of Masters of Albion shifts into more of an RTS as players defend villages against evil creatures that appear in the dark. Fighting back involves building and placing defensive weapons, such as turrets, constructing walls and other structures to funnel enemies where needed, and hiring heroes to protect the populace. You can also possess heroes to fight monsters directly in real-time combat.</p><p>Masters of Albion is 22 Cans’ first game since launching The Trail: Frontier Challenge in 2017. In October 2025, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/">Molyneux told <em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a> that the game serves as a form of “redemption” following 22 Cans’ previous projects in which he overpromised and underdelivered, such as 2012's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2013/05/26/22-cans-announces-goddess-curiosity-cube-winner-will-control-the-game.aspx">Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube</a> and 2014’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/godus/b/ios/archive/2014/08/07/godus-launches-today-on-ios.aspx">Godus</a>. He also stated that Masters of Albion would be the final game of his 43-year career.</p><p>“I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about Curiosity,” Molyneux told <em>VGC</em> last October. “But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time. And so, Masters of Albion is a redemption title for me. But also, it’s my last game. It just is.”</p><p>It makes sense, then, why Molyneux bills Masters of Albion as the nexus of every game he’s worked on, from Dungeon Keeper to Fable. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map,” says Molyneux in today’s announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Masters of Albion will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/12/peter-molyneuxs-final-game-masters-of-albion-gets-april-release-date]]></content:encoded>

One continues to expand the layered and complex setting of Golarion. The other, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em>, introduces new and updated magic classes for its players.</p><p>In an official live stream, reported on by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/pathfinder-announces-two-new-rulebooks.717153/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Paizo announced both <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> and the <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplements for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>.</p><picture>

Among those options are four new dedicated spellcasting classes: Magus, Necromancer, Runesmith, and Summoner.</p><p>These classes are important since three out of the four are updates from <em>Pathfinder First Edition</em>. The Runesmith can transcribe and apply magical runes and glyphs. The Summoner can summon creatures to do their bidding. The Magus is a classic GISH; a combination of strong spellcasting and martial prowess. With this new supplement, players can see how these classes work in the latest edition of the game.</p><p>In addition, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> introduces over 200 new spells to the game, new character archetypes, and new schools of magic derived from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-impossible-lands-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Impossible Lands</a>. If you are attending GenCon this year, you can pick up a copy of this book for yourself. The store page listing has it priced at an MSRP of $29.99.</p><p>The other supplement, <em>Lost Omens: High Seas,</em> is a continuation of Paizo's in-depth setting books in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tian Xia</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a>. As the name suggests, the book will cover the open waters of the Inner Sea. This will include the failed utopian island of Hermea, Mediogati Island, the mysterious Mordant Spire, the pirate-scoured isles of the Shackles, and the dangerous underwater depths.</p><p>The <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplement releases in July. The store page price listed is an MSRP of $44.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>2025 was an odd year for me and my "best of" list. Many of the titles I thought would be absolute locks for this--like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <em>Civilization VII</em> and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--ended up getting nowhere near it!</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions/"><u><em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign was a disaster</u></a>, and I wasn't able to play the multiplayer at all thanks to a bug where the game told me my GPU wasn't physically connected (it, uh, was), so it's been a total write-off.<a href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5/"> <u><em>EU V </em>was fine, but as I said at the time</u></a>, it's so ambitious, and needs so much more tweaking, that it feels like a game I won't sit down with properly for another year or two.<a href="https://aftermath.site/endless-legend-2-review-impressions-early-access/"> <u><em>Endless Legend 2</em> was just a good old-fashioned disappointment</u></a>, and<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review/"> <u><em>Civ VII</em>, whew, man</u></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024/"><div><p>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024 - Aftermath</p><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>I know it's weird to lead a list of my games of the year by talking about games that weren't on it, but those disappointments defined my 2025 in a way, and seem to be mirroring many of the various crises the wider games industry itself has faced in 2025. Namely AAA bloat and strategic mismanagement leading to dependable sequels losing their way,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two/"> <u>before the resulting layoffs</u></a> threaten to simply make everything even worse.</p><p>In a way, then, putting this list together felt like a slight bummer; I'd come into 2025 <em>really </em>excited for a bunch of seemingly dependable heavy-hitters, all of which ended up letting me down. Thankfully, <em>Civ VII</em> sucking simply freed up more time to play other stuff, like all the games on this list, most of which I'd never even heard of until I sat down with them, but all of which ruled on their own merits, and my year was better for having played them.</p><h3 id="flotsam">FLOTSAM</h3><figure></figure><p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, Flotsam is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlook, actually feels more like the start of a new world instead. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/flotsam-impressions-review-city-builder/"><div><p>Flotsam Builds Some Hope At World’s End</p><p>The end of the old world is a chance for a new one</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="tavern-keeper">TAVERN KEEPER</h3><figure></figure><p>It's always fun running a pub, pubs are inherently great, but running a pub that's truly&nbsp;<em>yours</em>, right down to the designs on the cushions and the placement of the silverware, is even better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/"><div><p>Tavern Keeper: It’s Good</p><p>“But the only brew for the brave and true...comes from the [Redacted]!”</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="town-to-city">TOWN TO CITY</h3><figure></figure><p>It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores.

            <title><![CDATA[A Steam Sale’s Background Art Was Filled With Hidden Free Game Codes]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-team-17-hidden-codes-free-games-deal-secret-artwork-2000658974</link>
            <guid>1403869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At any given point in time, there are at least two or three different sales happening on Steam. Most of them include some background art that you aren’t really meant to notice. But Team 17’s new sale did something I’ve not seen before. It hid free game codes in the sale artwork for those observant enough to spot them.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://go.bsky.app/redirect?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbuff.ly%2Fxu8nST3">Team 17 launched its big Hidden Treasures Sale on Steam</a>, featuring discounts on over 50 different games, ranging from recent hits like <em>Dredge</em> to older titles like <em>Golf With Friends</em> and<em> Worms Reloaded</em>. There’s some great stuff on sale from today until January 19.</p>

 <p>But the best deals were hidden in plain sight. Over on the Hidden Treasures Steam event page, you can spot a pirate-themed background filled with gold and treasure. If you scroll down and look past the game deals, <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/32941731/c454af314fa3cb448a7a4012aa50e6bf78b8c507.png">you’ll spot faint writing on what looks like parchment paper</a>. And it’s buried in these words that you’ll also notice some alphanumeric codes, which are in fact keys for different Team 17 games.</p>

 <p>Shortly after the sale went live, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcamwhbmpq2g">this neat detail was shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a>, but even by then, it seems like most of it not all of the codes had already been redeemed. And at this point, it seems all but certain that every code has been grabbed and used.</p>

 <p>Even if you didn’t get a free game, you can still take advantage of the sale. Here are some of the best deals I spotted in the Team 17 Steam sale. These offers may not be as good as free, but they still beat paying full price.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Heavenly Bodies</em> – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Hell Let Loose</em> – $21 ($60)</li> <li><em>Golf With Friends</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Killer Frequency</em> – $5 ($25)</li> <li><em>Moving Out</em> – $2.50 ($25)</li> <li><em>Conscript: Director’s Cut</em> – $8 ($24)</li> <li><em>The Escapists 2</em> – $4 ($27)</li> <li><em>Overcooked 2</em> – $1.70 ($17)</li> <li><em>Sworn</em> – $20 ($40)</li> </ul> <p>If you were one of the lucky ones to snag a code, let us know in the comments below and tell us what game you got!</p>

                <p>While a few first-party Nintendo Switch 2 games have invoked sticker shock, that won't be the case with Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Once the Switch 2 edition of the life sim releases on January 15, it'll be the least expensive paid upgrade from Nintendo.</p><p>Existing owners of New Horizons only have to cough up $5 for the upgrade pack, while the entire Switch 2 edition retails for $65 digitally and physically.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is making kids’ online safety a cornerstone of her administration, and she’s eyeing a platform that has often flown under the radar: Roblox.</p><p>As progress in Congress has stagnated, states have become the primary drivers of internet reforms meant to protect kids, including age verification laws and new requirements for online platforms. Hochul announced a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/protecting-our-kids-governor-hochul-announces-nation-leading-proposals-protect-kids-online">sweeping plan</a> to expand online parental controls and age verification, which she’ll tout at her State of the State on Tuesday. It notably pulls from a piece of legislation crafted by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic meant to plug a gap in earlier state legislation in order to encompass online gaming. Gounardes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a 2024 interview when he first introduced the legislation as the New York Children’s Online Safety Act (NYCOSA) — now the Stop Online Predators Act — that the idea came from parents who wondered whether his earlier kids safety legislation would cover Roblox, the social gaming platform that is extremely popular with children.</p><p>Drawing from the bill, Hochul’s plans include expanding requirements for platforms to verify their users’ ages to include online gaming platforms like Roblox. She also wants platforms to keep kids’ accounts on the highest privacy settings by default so that they can’t be seen or contacted by unknown accounts, and to disable AI chatbot features for kids. The plan also includes requirements for parents to be able to limit financial transactions on their kids’ accounts.</p><div><p>“There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different”</p></div><p>New York state leaders don’t want Roblox, for which more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">40 percent of users are reportedly under age 13</a>, to be left out of new protections. “From toys to food to cars, we regulate all sorts of products to keep children safe. There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different,” Gounardes said in a statement ahead of the State of the State. “Online platforms like Roblox are enabling unsafe environments for children, including allowing predators to send explicit messages to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urgently need to pass crucial online safety protections to stop predators from exploiting children and create safer online environments for children to play.”</p><p>Roblox did not immediately provide comment on the State of the State proposal, but Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield told <em>The Verge</em> after Gounardes unveiled the legislation in 2024 that the company is a “COPPA compliant gaming platform that is designed for all ages,” referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). Porterfield said Roblox has “gone beyond COPPA-compliance and built safety tools and systems that address the unique needs of children and do not support photo uploads or other features specific to social media platforms.” The company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat">since rolled out</a> new requirements for users to undergo a facial scan to estimate their age in order to access its chat features.</p><div><p>States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections</p></div><p>The kids online safety proposals were the first of the State of the State plans that Hochul previewed last week, underscoring how important an issue that internet safeguards for kids has become in states like New York. States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections since the 1990s. The proposals come alongside offline actions to address kids’ mental health, including expanded mental health clinics in schools, and an advisory board that includes 11-to-17-year-olds to inform youth mental health policy. They build on earlier legislation passed in New York state, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182396/new-york-governor-social-media-law-parental-consent-algorithms">Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act</a>, which requires social media companies to obtain parental consent for using “addictive feeds” on kids.</p><p>But some of the proposals, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/859351/age-verification-app-stores">age verification</a>, come with their own risks that opponents ranging from industry players to civil liberties groups oppose on the grounds that they could require more data collection, and potentially chill adults’ speech online. The Supreme Court recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/internet-censorship/686042/supreme-court-fsc-paxton-porn-age-verification-ruling">opened the door</a> to some age verification of porn sites, breaking from earlier decisions, but age-gating platforms that host a wide variety of speech raises even thornier questions. Courts across the country have struck down a variety of laws seeking to impose age verification at the platform and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/849752/texas-app-store-accountability-act-age-verification-injunction">app store level</a>, raising questions of constitutionality under the First Amendment. But states have continued to try to enact different kinds of age verification laws nonetheless, creating the potential for a fractured landscape state to state should some courts eventually uphold them.</p><p>Still, many advocates for more online safeguards are praising Hochul’s plans. “The online games kids play and the social media platforms they use for hours and hours a day have become veritable hunting grounds for predators,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said in a statement. “Kids and teens need these new protections now more than ever.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MjI4"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lauren Feiner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/policy/860727/new-york-governor-hochul-roblox-kids-online-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>By now, I hope I’ve made it abundantly clear that I’m an anime fan <a href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires/"><u>born to slice-of-life romance</u></a>, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/solo-leveling-impressions-anime/"><u>condemned to a lifetime of battle shonen exposure.</u></a> So when I learned that a friend gifted another friend of mine a romance manga I’d only vaguely heard of over the holidays, I treated it like homework I actually wanted to do. I binged the entire thing in a week. Naturally, when the three of us finally met up this past weekend, my friend sheepishly admitted they hadn’t even cracked the spine yet. Which means the burden now falls to you, dear reader, to hear why <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> has quietly become one of my favorite recent romance reads, thanks to how effortlessly cozy it is.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://squareenixmangaandbooks.square-enix-games.com/product/9781646092864?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</u></em></a>, by mangaka <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jinushi</u></a>, is an office workspace rom-com tailor-made for anyone weak to kinda mean goth women who’d step on you and the oddly endearing charm of exhausted, gravely-voiced middle-aged men. It’s a bisexual harvest if ever there was one, and a rare adult romance with an unproblematic age gap.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woclqV1wINo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」メインキャストボイスPV"></iframe></figure><p>Like “<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-04/rockin-out-with-sumiko-arai-the-guy-she-was-interested-in-wasnt-a-guy-at-all-manga-creator/.223419?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Green Yuri</u></a>” (AKA <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><em><u>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</u></em></a>) <em>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</em>, found its <a href="https://thetv.jp/news/detail/1084476/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>humble beginnings as a manga series published on Twitter</u></a> in the wake of the pandemic before getting picked up by Square Enix as a serial. It’s not only the first serialized series from Jinushi, but it’s also one that’s got <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-09-21/smoking-behind-the-supermarket-with-you-tv-anime-reveals-main-cast/.229036?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an anime adaptation in the wings</u></a> in 2026. So allow me to yap about why the romance manga is heat so you can say “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>but I was there!</u></a>” too.</p><figure><blockquote>— TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」公式 (@yanisuu_anime) <a href="https://twitter.com/yanisuu_anime/status/1946132855618502947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>From the jump, I was immediately arrested by how <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You </em>wastes no time resonating with anyone trapped in the corporate grind, clinging to the tiny rituals that make the day-to-day survivable as the series’ thematic anchor. Be that stopping by a convenience store, catching the warm smile of a store clerk who unknowingly gave you just enough serotonin to make that bread, or just grab some smokes and take the edge off from a hard day's work.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the cadence of Sasaki’s life. Sasaki is a middle-aged, overworked salaryman who every day gets berated by his boss. The series, on the whole, strikes a chord with anyone who deals with the corporate grind and finds solace in frequenting a haunt only to be graced by the beaming smile of a store clerk that gives you a boost in happy brain chemicals to continue waking up and making that bread. Or, at least doing so until you need to grab a smoke to take the edge off. That’s the case with Sasaki, who ends each day at a convenience store not just to grab groceries, but to bask in the bright, grounding presence of a cute clerk named Yamada. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>That is, until the rhythm of his day is thrown off one night when he swings by the store late and discovers Yamada has already clocked out. Instead, he’s greeted by a leather-jacketed, pierced woman named Tayama, who casually invites him out back to share a smoke and some company. Because Sasaki is, frankly, severely face-blind in the most endearing way, he never clocks that Tayama—whom he assumes is some coworker he’s somehow overlooked for months—is actually Yamada without the uniform, <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1829923640743444748?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">customer-service smile</a>, or the practiced bubbly disposition she uses on the clock.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/LS6xTacYqF?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/LS6xTacYqF</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1977692567988060316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>What follows is a wonderfully lopsided pseudo-love triangle in which “Tayama” (and the rest of the store staff, fully aware of the comedy of errors unfolding) gently teases Sasaki for his obvious crush on her other self. Meanwhile, Sasaki, thrilled to finally have a smoking buddy, finds himself falling for the woman behind the polite platitudes. On paper, <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of wacky setup you’d only find in a gag manga or an early-aughts rom-com—the sort of <em>Miss Congeniality</em>, <em>Princess Diaries</em> bit where a change of clothes and vernacular somehow renders a person unrecognizable. And the whole Yamada/Tayama dual identity asks for a level of suspension of disbelief from the reader that practically nudges the series into sketch comedy territory. But what makes the manga sing is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/RSOrscuIFC4?list=TLPQMTIwMTIwMjY3M6WWk_hqFw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>beneath its deeply silly premise</u></a>, it harbors a romance that could only work between adults.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/7slP9xWlTC?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/7slP9xWlTC</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1897839463834976469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>A huge part of that comes down to smoking itself. As a habit, smoking is both a self-destructive vice and a symbolic pressure valve to let off some steam. But between smokers, it becomes something more intimate: a quiet ritual of shared air, time, and vulnerability so addictive that you’d jump at the offer regardless of how chilly it is outside. Simply put, it’s a sophisticated, mature mode of connection that simply doesn’t exist in garden-variety romances. For the non-smokers of the world, it’s the equivalent of loading up a YouTube video on someone else’s account or sending them a song that’s been haunting your brain—forever altering the other person’s algorithm. Folding your tiny, private time-waster into someone else’s life in a way that feels strangely tender. “Intimacy in the modern day,” as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theofficialnorthernlion/video/7575988525087214866?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7494297314892203551&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitch streamer Northernlion</u></a> puts it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>Swap out playlists for preferred cigarette brand flavors, fireside chats, and easy shared silences that stretch as long as you let them, and you get something even more specific and profound as the bedrock of a romance. It’s here that <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> takes its cozy premise and leans into how something as ordinary as sharing a smoke with a friend can spark a kind of honesty and intimacy that hits harder than an indirect kiss over a shared drink. The small rituals between Sasaki and Tayama—the teasing, the quiet moments, the unspoken warmth—never overstay their welcome. Instead, each chapter offers another faint glow of their ember‑warm yearning, slowly shifting from easygoing companionship into something unmistakably romantic.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">３すう。 <a href="https://t.co/ZJj22t03lE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/ZJj22t03lE</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1898637057540407566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The flames of that yearning are certainly aided by <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1884197016353599641?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Jinushi’s online illustrations </a>of the two fulfilling <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1983550204868710535?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">nurse‑and‑patient cosplay</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1819346049754099821?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">other cheeky fantasies</a>. But the real magic lies in the series' quieter, less showy moments of wish fulfillment, threaded through the manga. The simple, disarming intimacy of being understood. <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of romance where letting the long fuse of this oddball relationship burn at its own pace is part of the delight. After all, you can’t appreciate a cigarette if you inhale it all in one hungry pull. Beneath the disguises and crossed signals, they’re just two people who genuinely like being in each other’s orbit—and who would quietly ache at the thought of losing the small, daily comfort of talking through the weight of their days or shooting the breeze about nothing at all.&nbsp; </p>

			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">Minecraft-like game that was recently resurrected</a> by its original creator, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, and is now due to be out tomorrow on<a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/"> <strong>January 13, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has just hit another milestone in its incredible comeback story, as Collins-Laflamme announces that the development costs for <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> as it builds Hytale in early access have been fully funded for the next two years based on <strong>pre-order sales alone.</strong></p>



<p>The game isn't even out yet in early access, but the community that has built around it since work on the game first started in 2015, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/"> stayed with it after it was acquired by <strong>Riot</strong></a>, only to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">shuttered by Riot and the team disbanded</a>, and then revived within the last few months have shown that they are very excited for Hytale to finally be here.</p>



<p>"<em>Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases</em>," Collins-Laflamme wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). "<em>Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future. Thank you for all the support. <strong>Hytale is saved.</strong> We are almost home.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Minecraft-like MMO has been a long time coming, and tomorrow's early access launch not only represents a new chapter for the game and the studio but also an incredible accomplishment for the team to be able to get it out of Riot's hands and across the finish line for release.</p>



<p>Of course, a whole new challenge begins once it is live and in players' hands, but at least the team at Hypixel Studios has the chance to see if they're up for that challenge, instead of the game lying dead in a waste basket of Riot-owned IPs, left wondering if they could have ever made something truly great with Hytale.</p>

There is a strange deliciousness in experiencing a game from a perspective that it does not otherwise allow. Sure, things don't always look right, there's just this opportunity to rethink how you view a particular world. Recently, it appears that someone playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> got to do just that, by switching it into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooting</a> mode as opposed to its usual third-person camera, all thanks to an accident.
</p>
<p>
You see, over on the game's subreddit, user Short_Satisfaction_9 (I guess Short_Satisfaction_1-8 was already taken) shared a clip of themself playing the game in first-person using console commands. There's some obvious jank in the clip, you can see through the player-character's face at points which is always yucky, as well as their arms when they're doing some shooty stuff. This, however, is not a thing you are meant to be able to do, and has already been removed by developer Embark.

"We have just pushed a hotfix removing the 'NewConsole' command," community manager Ossen shared in a message in the game's official Discord (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-removes-a-hidden-first-person-exploit-just-1-day-after-it-was-uncovered-this-feature-was-never-meant-to-be-player-facing/">PCGamer</a>). "This feature was never meant to be player-facing. We're continuing to investigate related reports and may take action where appropriate to protect fair play and the integrity of the game."
</p><p>
Just because it exists in one sort of functional form doesn't mean you should expect it at any point in the future, as the devs have already said that it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/dont-count-on-arc-raiders-ever-getting-a-first-person-mode-once-you-start-being-able-to-put-your-face-right-up-against-an-asset-it-kind-of-falls-apart/">extremely unlikely they'll ever add one in</a>. Still! An interesting insight into another world where it is a first-person game, but one you'll have to find an inter-dimensional portal to travel to. Good luck?

              <p>The latest of Steam’s creative weekly sales has just gone live, and this time it’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/detective">Detective Fest</a>. But rather than become entangled in red string as you try to pin all the available games to your enormous pinboard, we’ve inspected the selection through our microscope, whittled down the suspects, and then performed yet another detective cliche, to select the most suspicious(ly good) games for you to interrogate.</p>  <p>Investigative games have become a rather big deal in recent years, with many indie titles having broken through to the mainstream to enormous success. And, so of course, you’ve got the likes of&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Rise of the Golden Idol </em>in the sale, alongside less recent classics like <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. But you already know about all of those, so where’s the good in my suggesting those? Nope, let’s dive a little deeper with a selection of games that won’t be appearing at the top of all the store’s lists.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/"><em>The Ratline</em></a></h2>  <p>You know who was making amazing family-tree-like detective games long before&nbsp;<em>The Roottrees Are</em> <em>Dead</em>? <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/">Owlskip</a>. Titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/riley-rochelle-musical-music-pc-steam-sheinman-games-1849676247"><em>Riley &amp; Rochelle</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/07/family/">Family,</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/09/rivals/"><em>Rivals</em></a> were years ahead on the format, and definitely deserve to be discovered in light of <em>Roottrees</em>‘ breakout success. Anything else is frankly unfair. <em>The Ratline</em> is the latest from the studio, due out in March, once again asking you to piece together a mystery from an array of clues and documents. This time things are set in 1971 and have you hunt down Nazi fugitives after the murder of a priest, and who doesn’t need a little Nazi hunting just now? There’s a demo out for Detective Fest.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781420/Surradia_An_Art_Retrospective/"><em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em></a></h2>  <p>There’s also a demo for the upcoming <em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em>, a detective game about investigating the disappearance of three magical artists who vanished during World War II. That means scouring photographs, reading letters, and of course paying close attention to artworks, all found in a museum, as you try to unpick the mystery. There’s no official release date for the game yet, but the demo’s here right now.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618570/The_Detectives_Apprentice/"><em>The Detective’s Apprentice</em></a></h2>  <p>This is a tremendous trailer! You’re Cleo, working for world-renowned detective Maya Lynch, learning the ropes in this unbelievably lovely-looking game. There’s a demo out for Detective Fest, which features Cleo’s first three cases, with the full game due later.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3627210/Mansion_of_a_Million_Monsters/">Mansion of a Million Monsters</a></em></h2>  <p><em>Mansion of a Million Monsters</em> takes a decidedly different approach to the detective genre, combining its investigative ways with dungeon-crawling action. It has the vibes of one of those classic Amiga games that everyone still raves about today. The developers say they’ll hopefully have a demo up for this one in the next day or so.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060960/Sleuth_Saga_Under_Starless_Skies/"><em>Sleuth Saga: Under Starless Skies</em></a></h2>  <p>This detective sim is based on all the right names, like&nbsp;<em>Phoenix Wright</em> and&nbsp;<em><i>Danganronpa</i></em>. Set in the year 780 Quattuoris 32nd (which I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> find on my calendar), this is the tale of the daughter of investigative journalist Frederick Emery. Her father is found dead, a staged suicide, and she sets out to disprove the police’s claims. It’s to be five episodes long, with the first now playable via a free demo. Also, later this week developers Arboreal Interactive hopes to update with&nbsp;<em>another</em> free chapter, Chapter 0.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3485220/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Murder_Otaku/"><em>Murder Is Game Over: Murder Otaku</em></a></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Murder Is Game Over</em> series of pixel point-n-clickers started in 2022, and&nbsp;<em>Murder Otaku</em> is already the fourth! It came out toward the end of last year, and if you click with its tale of solving the murder of a J-pop singer at an anime convention, that means you’ve now got another three games that are sure things. You can pick up the whole lot in the Cleo’s Complete Casefile bundle, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/33733/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Cleos_Complete_Casefile/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://hitheryongames.itch.io/murder-is-game-over-cleos-complete-casefile">Itch</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/"><em>of the Devil</em></a></h2>  <p><em>of the Devil </em>is a six-part episodic detective game inspired by the likes of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>. Its first free episode was released last year, and two more paid episodes have already been released since then! The game, which features amazing art, is set in the cyberpunk future of 2086 and has you playing a criminal defense attorney. So yeah, grab the first episode for nothing, and then see if you want to pick up the next two, with releases seeming to come nice and quickly.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131660/Call_of_the_Golden_Valley/"><em>Call of the Golden Valley</em></a></h2>  <p>Australian detective sim&nbsp;<em>Call of the Golden Valley</em> came out last October and still offers a free demo. You play Danielle, an American tourist who arrives in the country to visit a friend, Marisa, only to find she’s gone missing. So you begin investigating the small town, piecing together evidence, and finding out why Golden Valley is the sight of so many disappearing hikers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919600/Paper_Perjury/"><em>Paper Perjury</em></a></h2>  <p>Another game you can play right now,&nbsp;<em>Paper Perjury</em> is a visual novel series from Paper Cat Games where new Azure City Police Department clerk Justina Smith begins investigating some peculiar crimes. Case 1 of the game is available as a free demo, and a sixth case is due to be added pretty soon.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689930/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved/"><em>Detective Instinct: Farewell, My Beloved</em></a></h2>  <p>A few of the games mentioned above were inspired to some degree by <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but few wear it on their sleeve so much as&nbsp;<em>Detective Instinct</em>. It looks like it could have come from Capcom, and this is high praise. The mystery adventure is all about trying to track down a woman who disappears from a train, only no one on board but you can remember her. It came out late last year, and is celebrating Detective Fest with a discount and a free demo.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/masters-of-albion-peter-molyneuxs-final-game-gets-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1403779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Masters of Albion, the new game from long-time developer Peter Molyneux has a release date. On Monday, developer 22cans announced that the game is set to launch on April 22.</p>



<p>The game will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-masters-of-albion-is-a-reimagining">Masters of Albion Is A “Reimagining”</h2>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, Masters of Albion is a <strong>“bold reimagining of the God Game genre.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Mixing strategy with simulation, town management and tower defence, the game takes you into the rich narrative world of Albion,</strong>” the game’s description says. <strong>“Starting in the undeveloped village of Oakridge, players will step into the body of a god, controlling the town and its citizens, building a small business and completing orders for various customers.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, the game comes from Peter Molyneaux, the man credited with creating the Fable franchise, The Movies, Populous, and many more. Back when it was announced, the 66-year-old Molyneux mentioned that Masters of Albion was likely to be his last game because of his age.</p>



<p>In a release announcing the release date, Molyneux said that the new game owes a lot to his prior titles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</strong></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-gamestop/</link>
            <guid>1403773</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Six and a half years ago—after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/gamestop-calls-off-its-search-for-a-buyer-sees-a-one-day-stock-dive-of-27/">a failed corporate sale attempt</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gamestop-posts-massive-loss-as-pre-owned-game-sales-plummet/">massive financial losses</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/management-reshuffle-at-gamestop">the departure</a>/<a href="https://x.com/ModernVintageG/status/1156658352874827776/photo/1">layoff</a> of many key staff—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/why-some-of-us-will-miss-gamestop-when-its-gone/">I wrote about</a> what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/">meme stock mania</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/gamestop-stock-falls-sharply-amid-5m-share-sales-plan-sec-investigation/">helped prop up the company’s finances a bit</a>, I’ll admit the video game <a href="https://x.com/OPMerchandise/status/2009627597915717797">and Funko Pop</a> retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.</p>
<p>GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/">has abruptly shut down 400 stores</a> across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm">per SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p>GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/gamestop-plans-up-to-200-store-closures-expects-many-more-on-the-way/">there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019</a>—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.</p>
<h2>The ghost of Tower Records appears in a vision</h2>
<p>The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/for-console-games-downloads-are-approaching-a-tipping-point/">more than half of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s game sales came via download rather than disc</a>, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue</a>, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/sonys-new-playstation-plus-launches-in-us-with-over-800-games/">PlayStation Plus</a>, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">skipping physical releases altogether</a> these days, while Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards</a> that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.</p>
