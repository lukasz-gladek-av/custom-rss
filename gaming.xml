Following Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-again-now-arriving-in-november">recent delay to November</a>, developer GSC Game World has rewarded patient fans with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLJ3lV-_V8">35-minute deep dive</a> into the post-apocalyptic horror shooter sequel - showcasing a mission across its bleak, beautiful open-world.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's "huge" world - officially known as the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone - consists of 20 regions, each with its own residents, anomalies, and nature. It's also said to feature few barriers, meaning players are free explore locations as they choose - with the goal being to "give the feeling of freedom, to give the feeling of loneliness, to give the feeling of anxiety".
</p>
<p>
While GSC's deep dive offers a good look at Stalker 2's strikingly varied enviromental work, the bulk of it is focused on the swamp - a formerly inhabited region, free of Stalkers but home to many other dangers, that plays host to a quest in which players must disable deadly, repurposed psi-beacons in order to reach the Clear Sky base.

<p>
As the quest played out, GSC emphasises the freeform nature of its mission design, explaining that it's impossible to see all content and every character in a single playthrough - players will get a slightly different story, slightly different quests, and meet different people depending on the choices they make.
</p>
<p>
Some of those choices might be tied to missions - at one point we see the player opting to approach a key location from the comparative safety of a rat-infested wine cellar rather than the potentially deadlier overground - while others are more organic. GSC says it's encouraging exploration by placing new equipment, weapons, weapon attachments, and upgrades out in the world - many of which can't be acquired through the story.
</p>
<p>
In total, Stalker 2 will feature 35 weapons, and each can be equipped with different upgrades and attachments for greater diversity. They'll be used against the likes of zombies, Pseudodogs (which roam in packs alongside phantom versions of themselves), and mutant pigs known as the Flesh. GSC notes its AI doesn't cheat by knowing where the player is at all times, and will instead hunt them by first hypothesing where they'll be.
</p>
<p>
Players will want to keep an eye on their hunger levels and tiredness to ensure their efficiency doesn't dwindle, and they'll also need to be mindful of their equipment load, as overburdening will limit their movement. GSC says it's deliberately avoided making Stalker 2 easy for players, as this would "kill the grip of reality" - an attitude reflected in the decision to forego a levelling system in favour of more naturalistic pogression, with players improving as they grow more familiar with the environment, or gain faster reactions through experience.
</p>
<p>
GSC's full 35-minute deep dive features plenty more tidbits of information - including a little about the routines of different people in the Zone, and the dynamic nature of factions, which can sometimes change their leader, even break up - and it's well worth a watch, if only to goggle at its gorgeously bleak environments.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is now set to launch on 20th Novmber, when it'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, PC (via  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en#editions">GSC's website</a>), and Game Pass.

But we never got an official announcement. Now, it looks like thousands of people are already playing the game in some sort of early play test, with the game reaching over 18,000 concurrent players earlier today.</p><p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Deadlock playercount started slowly climbing earlier this month, reaching a peak of 18,254 earlier today and expected to climb further. IGN understands that the game's current early access period is operating under an invite system, where certain Steam users are receiving invites and can then suggest other individuals to also receive invites.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Sreenshots and video footage of the game available to the general public remain minimal, given that players are required to sign a strict NDA before being permitted to play. However, players are free to discuss their experiences with the game, with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"DeadlockTheGame" subreddit</a> already accruing members and discussion of early impressions.</p><p>What we know so far is that Deadlock seems to be a mishmash of hero shooter ala Overwatch and MOBA with lane-based gameplay like DOTA 2 and tower defense elements. It takes place in a fantasy/steampunk setting. While we haven't gotten good looks at its hero cast just yet for the reasons outlined above, everyone currently playing seems to really love one character in particular:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me: I don't' get attached to things that easily!<br>Also me after 0.2 seconds of playing Deadlock: <a href="https://t.co/1EUfO0AK4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1EUfO0AK4d</a></p>— Moirai Agar'el ♻️💚 Slime Mom - S̶c̴u̴f̸f̸ ̸A̵R̶c̴ (@MoiraiVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoiraiVT/status/1821942558873833840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>With the growing playerbase and invites seemingly available to anyone willing to ask, it seems likely that an actual for-real official announcement of Deadlock may be imminent. Valve's been on a bit of a spree with stealth releases lately, having <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2">quietly dropped Counter-Strike 2</a> last year and Half-Life: Alyx being announced just a few short months before its eventual release.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

And if those constraints are just really constraining, then it’s not very appealing because who wants to work on something where the one thing they want to explore is not possible to explore?” said Sawyer. <br></p><p>He then reiterated that he still loves the <em>Fallout </em>franchise, adding: “I think there’s still a ton of stories that can be told in there and questions that can be asked about society.”</p><p>Sawyer ended his answer by pointing out that working with any IP is like that and ultimately it comes down to “what are we allowed to do and not allowed to do” with the characters and world. </p><p>So is it possible that Sawyer could lead the charge on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-interview-fallout-teases-show-starfield-1851449078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-interview-fallout-teases-show-starfield-1851449078">a new <em>Fallout </em>game, maybe even a <em>New Vegas</em> follow-up</a></span>? Yes. But Bethesda will have to let the famed designer do what he and the team want or they won’t be interested in playing in that radioactive wasteland. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo Switch exclusives don’t go on sale as often as games for other platforms, and it’s not uncommon to see games that were released years ago still listed at full price. However, a few big Nintendo titles are currently discounted--including big price cuts on multiple Zelda games, including Tears of the Kingdom, and smaller discounts on recent releases such as <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLuigi-s-Mansion-2-HD-Nintendo-Switch%2F5337897463%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-deals-games-controllers-nintendo-consoles%2F1100-6525715%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPaper-Mario-The-Thousand-Year-Door-Nintendo-Switch%2F5337897462%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-deals-games-controllers-nintendo-consoles%2F1100-6525715%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>.

The reprints are identical to the original versions--Link's Amiibo features the adorable doll-like art style from the Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening remake that launched on Nintendo Switch back in 2019, while the Zelda figure captures her appearance from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The reprints officially launch on September 26, and you can preorder both for $16 each at Best Buy. We recommend grabbing them quickly if interested, since we don't know how many figures Nintendo made for this reprinting and most Amiibo figures sell out before launch.</p><p dir="ltr">This Link's Awakening Link and Wind Waker Zelda Amiibo reprints drop alongside the next game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. The Switch-exclusive adventure features the same top-down presentation and toy-like art style of the Link's Awakening remake but mixes things up in big ways, most notably making Princess Zelda the main playable character for the first time.

In a new <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nacon announced that it will now delay the Terminator: Survivors launch until 2025, previously expected to release in October 2024.



Nacon broadly cited the need for “some additional time” in order to realize its vision for the game. The studio also wants to “deliver the game that fits your expectations.”



Nacon did not break down the exact cause for delay, nor offer a more concrete release window.



However, the devs say they are impressed by fan enthusiasm, and thanked the community for their understanding and support. Although fans are dismayed by Terminator: Survivors’ delay, they did support the decision to await a smooth launch.

&nbsp;



Nacon first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Terminator: Survivors</a> in February 2024, during the Nacon Connect showcase. A couple of months later, Nacon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-offline-story-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed more details</a> about the game during a Q&amp;A session.



Terminator: Survivors is an open-world survival game and first-person shooter, built in Unreal Engine 5. It will support co-op, as well as offline single-player gameplay.



According to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, players will “meet iconic characters of the franchise as well as original ones.” It will also feature “an unexplored storyline” about Judgment Day.



Terminator: Survivors previously planned to launch on PC on October 24, 2024, with console versions releasing later on. Most recently, Nacon shared a development video late last June, explaining the game’s inspiration from James Cameron’s original two films.

I don’t consider myself an achievement hunter. I see the appeal, and I’m excited to watch one of those videos on YouTube of someone achieving one of the rarest trophies in a game, but I don’t want to put in the work myself.

<figure><figcaption>Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>


Seriously, I’m right there with you. I want to get my hands on Black Myth: Wukong! But if you’re looking to track down and unlock all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, you must wait until August 20 to play the game.



Black Myth: Wukong launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, but sadly, there’s still no word about the Xbox Series X|S release date. It’s coming; the studio just doesn’t know when.



</p><hr><p>



To help you unlock achievements, it’s nice knowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-open-world-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is mostly linear</a> so that you won’t have to run far and wide. What do you think? Would Black Myth: Wukong be better as an open-world game or a linear one?

We have a lot of discussions with other teams to make sure if we’re doing similar things, we can collaborate and so if they want to do something afterward, we can take that into account. That’s what we do with our new Anvil pipeline, which is the tech teams working together. When we build new features, we make sure those features are available for all projects.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-wipe-event-nothing-new/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-escape-from-tarkov-wipe-event-is-nothing-new.951360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-wipe-event-nothing-new/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The first Escape from Tarkov wipe event has kicked off and is in full force worldwide. It’s nothing new, though – it’s something we’ve seen before, and it’s expected that it’ll be joined by other, typical pre-wipe events in due course. The event started after Battlestate Games had posted an image on socials showcasing in-game characters hefting around bags of concrete, and that was enough to give the game away.</p>
<p>For this first event, players will be able to level up their Hideout for nothing more than bottles of Pevko beer. Also, skill levels are climbing at an accelerated rate, which means that players will be able to hit max levels in a fraction of the time as wipe draws ever closer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wipe Soon?</h2>
<p>The next Tarkov wipe is on the horizon, and it has been a long time coming. This is officially the longest gap we’ve ever had between wipes at more than 225 days, and players are tired, to say the least. It has been a rocky few months for the Escape from Tarkov universe. First, there was the drama surrounding the release of Tarkov Arena, and then the reveal of The Unheard Edition threw the entire ecosystem into disarray. From the problems with incessant cheating to rampant instability, it has been a hard time to call yourslef a Tarkov fan of late.</p>
<p>But all that’s going to be pushed aside now that the first pre-wipe event has kicked off. It means that players are potentially days away from the all-important wipe that resets everyone’s account and brings hundreds of thousands of players back into the game. Plenty of changes and additions will be coming with the 0.15 patch that’ll come in alongside the wipe, too.</p>
<p>For now, players can take part in this basic event <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1822928618072236049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>To level up your Hideout as quickly as possible, you’ll need to collect Pevko beers. Fortunately, any enemy designated as a ‘Boss’ is now guaranteed to drop them, so you can farm them quite easily. Also, as you adventure across Norvinsk slaying these tougher-than-normal characters, you’ll find that your skill levels are climbing at an eye-watering pace, turning you into a super soldier in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As stressed, it’s the first pre-wipe event in Tarkov – we can expect much more to come in the next few days.</p>

		<p>It feels weird to not have the Olympics buzzing on my TV, much like the cicadas buzzing outside. (The cicadas, meanwhile, have not left yet.) In fact, Rob and I were so distraught over the endless sports being over that we decided to record a podcast waxing nostalgic over and event that literally concluded over the weekend. Alas. We do plan to watch the paralympicsthis month, so if you have recommendations on athletes to keep track of, events that are particularly interesting, let us know! (P.S. We are aware we've been pretty sports-centric recently.)</p><p>-pk, who cannot f'ing wait for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I have been watching <em>a lot</em> of Olympics the past two weeks, and supercharged by the way the men's and women's basketball teams finished, we decided to double dip on Sports!. (Yes, we talk a little Caleb Williams, too, but we are <em>really really really really</em> trying to play it cool.)</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an episode of HOA early with Janet, talking about Janet's office-to-studio transition, and how it's got someone like me considering a similar pivot this year. You'll hear that episode next week, but during the day, <em>Remap</em>'s football geniuses will join forces to check out the new Madden, in which us playing it <em>really really really</em> cool about Caleb Williams will suddenly be thrust into the spotlight, as we try to win with the Bears.) I think we're also going to spin the wheel to determine the next My Turn episode. If Sports! editing gets gone early, Cado will release it on Tuesday, otherwise...</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> ...Sports! will be released today. We're ditching the days between release. In the past, we dropped Sports! episodes on the main feed a few days later, timed to the Sunday NFL schedule, but it feels weird. The bonus you get for being a paid sub, like Remap Radio, is the podcast without ads. Cado and Rob will also take to the streams to continue motorsport managing.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>There will, hopefully, be a letter series that drop sometime this week, but as of this writing, I have not responded to Rob's prompt quite yet. Stay tuned, though. In the meantime, we'll be recording a new Remap Radio.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio goes live, amidst my push to finish <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>. We're at the endgame now, which opens the door to me finally playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>in the coming weeks.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-team-releases-35-minute-%E2%80%98deep-dive%E2%80%99-trailer.951330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>GSC Game World has just given fans worldwide the best look at Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>. In an extended 35-minute walkthrough, the team guides players through various elements of this post-apocalyptic FPS title, which has been developing for over a decade. Outside of the recent leaks that showcased several minutes of rough gameplay, this is the longest and strongest look we’ve had at Stalker 2 since it was announced more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Recently, the team at GSC Game World revealed yet another delay for the highly anticipated open-world game. In an announcement that went hand-in-hand with a tongue-in-cheek trailer poking fun at all the postponements, it was revealed that the launch of Stalker 2 will be pushed back two months to November 20, 2024.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Everything You’d Want to Know</h2>
<p>Stalker 2 has been coming for a long time, but there’s still a little longer to wait. If it runs well on launch, it’ll be a very well-received game, as some trends have surfaced this year, such as the rampant popularity of the Fallout television series, that have left gamers worldwide <strong>hungry&nbsp;</strong>for a solid post-apocalyptic adventure. Given that it has been several years since the last major Stalker release, it’ll also be a boon for fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>Several key details have been revealed in the massive gameplay walkthrough published today by GSC Game World:</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl - Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRLJ3lV-_V8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s stressed just how wide, open, and diverse ‘The Zone’ will be in Heart of Chornobyl. It’s a staggering world that features&nbsp;<strong>twenty regions</strong>, each of which offers unique elements that encourage open exploration. With that being said, the team has constructed the game from the ground up to give a sense of loneliness and apprehension as the player explores, fully unaware of what might be lingering around the corner.</p>
<p>Despite Stalker 2 being a solid competitor to games like Fallout, there’s no ‘traditional’ levelling system in the game, which restricts the more RPG-focused elements some players might have been hoping for. It’s still Stalker at heart, though – and that means that you’ll still have those survival elements and some resource management to handle.</p>
<p>For instance, you need to manage your inventory to ensure you’re not carrying too much weight. Instead of a typical levelling system, Stalker 2 will unfold like Metro Exodus, with the player needing to explore and dig in all the game’s nooks and crannies to unlock attachments, weapons, equipment, and upgrades.</p>
<p>With a dynamic faction system, a whole host of nasties to battle, a massive open-world map, and countless opportunities to take on side quests and other assorted missions, Stalker 2 looks like the kind of game that you’ll pour&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>upon&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>into.</p>

                <p>Nacon's upcoming Terminator game, Terminator: Survivors, will potentially bring the future war to life in a way that gamers have never seen before. But Judgment Day is going to have to wait. Nacon has announced that the game has been pushed back from its PC release date on October 24. Instead, both the PC and console versions of Terminator: Survivors will now be released in 2025.</p><p>Marco Ponte, Nacom's CEO and creative director, released a statement online that explains why the studio felt it needed more time to work on the game.</p><p>"This deferral of the game's release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality," said Ponte. "On behalf of the Nacon Studio Milan team, I would like to thank all the players and fans of the franchise for their enthusiastic reception of Terminator: Survivors. We are extremely proud to have this opportunity to work on such an iconic franchise as Terminator, and are eager to reveal more of it to you. Thank you all for support… We’ll be back."</p><p>While the Terminator continuity has been mangled by the last two movies in the franchise, Terminator: Survivors is taking its cues from the first two films. The title is an open-world game set four years after Judgment Day, as humanity is still scrambling after Skynet's attempt to wipe them out. Gamers can play solo or join other players in co-op as they look for resources to build a base and mount an offensive against the machines.</p><p>Naturally, Skynet won't be taking that lying down, and numerous Terminators from the films will be featured in the game.</p>

                <p>Activision's upcoming shooter<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/"> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> continues to be hit by leaks. This time, all of the campaign cutscenes have been leaked instead of more multiplayer mechanics making their way online.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the earlier leaks, the reason seems to be that beta files for Black Ops 6 were uploaded to the PSN database for PlayStation 4 users, according to the<a href="https://x.com/charlieintel/status/1822232565853344125?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" rel="nofollow "> official Charlie Intel X/Twitter account</a>. Based on recent trailers, Black Ops 6 takes place in the '90s at the end of the Cold War and will feature legacy characters such as Woods and Adler. Similar to Black Ops Cold War, the game will have players second-guessing who they can trust.</p>
