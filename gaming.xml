			<p>This decision will probably surprise many who enjoyed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-crew-2-ubisofitiest-game/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-crew-motorfest-already-has-a-new-free-trial-and-even-discounts-one-month-after-launch/">The Crew Motorfest</a>, especially since Ubisoft shut down the servers earlier this year. In addition to the controversial move to close down the servers, they then began revoking the licenses to the games, and they delisted The Crew from digital storefronts last December. So far, Ubisoft has continued to make a lot of mistakes with this franchise, especially since it was one that was well-liked by many people.</p>
<p>While they are now trying to fix the situation by giving the games offline modes, the damage was already done when the servers shut down, as it also meant that any single-player content in the game was equally unavailable. By delisting the games and putting them in the "inactive games" section in the Ubisoft launcher, players couldn't launch the game at all, no matter how hard they tried. For those who owned it on Steam, they were prompted to put in a game key, which, of course, many didn't have. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft tried to cover their backs</a> by saying, "While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints," as mentioned in a comment to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>Today, Ubisoft&nbsp;<span>posted a statement on<a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;social media</a> addressing concerns about access to The Crew franchise. In this short trailer and statement, Ubisoft</span> officially confirmed the offline mode for both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest "to ensure long-term access to both titles," with more news about the franchise due to be released in the coming months.</p>
<p>It's possible that this decision comes after Ubisoft began revoking the licenses of those who owned The Crew 1, as multiple consumer agencies began investigating the legality of the situation, with <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stop Killing Games</a> founder Ross Scott speaking out on this issue frequently on his YouTube channel and his other social media. The Crew was released as a one-time purchase, and there was never any notice about an expiration date, which is where the legalities of the situation become a little bit murky.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games currently has an active petition to try and get The Crew's situation investigated, as it had a strong 12 million-person player base. France has robust protection laws regarding consumerism, with the website quoting that "it's one of the best opportunities to hold a publisher accountable for this action."</p>
<p>Whether this means that The Crew will be given back to the players and get something similar like The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest remains to be seen, but it's a start in the right direction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mad-scientist-of-vtubing.977436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shindigs-vtuber-twitch-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good ideas are born of careful consideration – of reading the room and giving the people precisely what they seem to want. <em>Great </em>ideas are born of ignoring the room altogether and instead saying “OK, but what if I tried the dumbest thing possible?” <a href="https://x.com/shindags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shindigs</a>, a vtuber known for transforming Twitch into a stage for elaborate bits with chat in the starring role, is a master of this craft. He’s created a vtuber avatar that’s <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1492628361369116673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a talking gun</a>. He’s turned chat into <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1828837214958301631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his <em>GTA </em>character’s intrusive thoughts</a>. He made his stream into <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1783361543893324231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a high school anime</a>. Shindigs is vtubing’s eternally-eclectic mad scientist, but he’s got one consistent ambition: to show everybody else what’s possible in hopes that they, too, will get a little weird with it.</p><p><em>This interview, originally conducted earlier in 2024, has been edited for length, clarity, and to bring portions of it into the present day. Also, disclosure: Shindigs is a friend of mine. We mostly talk about how much we appreciate Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski. Not his games – just him as a person.</em></p><p><strong>Aftermath: How did you get started with all of this? What started you down the path of concocting increasingly-elaborate vtuber bits?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>I got into vtubing around the same time most people did: 2020. And I had seen streamers kind of do something very similar before that. But really, what was the tipping point was learning <a href="https://www.live2d.com/en/cubism/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live2D</a>. My first venture into that was turning different objects into vtubers that I just thought were funny – like a McRib or a gun, which resonated with people. I’d been thinking about avatars for streaming for a very long time as something I would just love to be able to do, and there was technology beforehand that enabled that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gun Vtuber causes a scene at a party" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/096Nstr83FU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But I think it was the perfect storm of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-vtuber-industry-corporatization-labor-and-kawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate vtubing or idol vtubing exploding in the West</a> with more tools, with more people doing tutorials that the scene really blew up. And I think we entered an era that I've always wanted. In my head, I saw this world that had people who could be anything they wanted to be on stream. And it just happened. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Aftermath: What was your first big experiment?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>I can't remember what the very first one was, but the most memorable one was the 2020 BlizzCon. [The real event that year] was completely online [because of covid]. I had this avatar that was like the guy standing in the room where people are dancing around him, and he says, “They don’t know I’m a vtuber.” I was like, “Wow, this is gonna be the first BlizzCon without the Hilton hotel lobby,” which for people who don’t know is the super iconic lobby that people hang out in for that convention.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Blizzcon Afterparty Roleplay Stream - Day 1 (Stream VoD)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oSnRobjs0LM?start=969&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>So I found a picture of the Hilton hotel lobby, and I just made it my background. And I went live. I think in the course of a minute, I was like, “I'm going to do this.” I pretended that I was in the Hilton lobby. People would come into my chat, and I would just greet them as if we were meeting in real life. It came very naturally. Then that turned into a two-day [stream]. They weren't marathon streams, but that was the longest I’d ever streamed. They were, like, four-to-five hour streams, one per day. And we visited all the BlizzCon sites – not the actual convention, but things around Anaheim that people would be familiar with.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: I remember! I was there, haha. Or “there,” anyway – in chat.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> When I think back, that was the genesis. Up to that point, I remember doing similar-ish things like trying different vtubers every stream, but that kind of changed my brain chemistry in a way. After that, I did one or two more concepts around it, and then I didn’t pick it up until a year or two later.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Why the lag time? What happened?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>The vibe was like, “OK, it had its moment. I'm gonna move on to other things like normal streaming, making interactive streams, a funny channel, partner awards” – things like that. But the thing that really drew me back in is this other idea I had where chat could use text-to-speech [functionality] to talk to me. This is something that streamers have been doing for a long time. But the idea that I really wanted to pursue was that each chatter would be assigned to a specific character. So they had to play a persistent personality, so to speak, and to take it even further, it wouldn't just be one chatter per character; it would be “This group of ten people will be assigned to one person, this group of ten people will be to another.” So it'd be a way to bring more people in.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've updated my dating sim stream overlay with a choice mechanic.  </p><p>Now chat can vote on decisions within the game.   </p><p>The crazy part is chat is making up the story as they go with text-to-speech, and I have to play along.   </p><p>They've been getting really creative with it. <a href="https://t.co/mJdg2Edew4">pic.twitter.com/mJdg2Edew4</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1786834157697634376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The first memory I have of that was, I made a board room and I called it “the Twitch executives’ meeting run by Twitch chat” or something. We were just spitballing really stupid ideas of how to make Twitch weirder. And I was like, “Wait, this is really fun,” because in that moment, I realized I could literally talk to chat and someone would be talking back to me. This mess of a thing would literally talk back to me. And I could respond to each one as a different person. So then I started pursuing that a bit more. That started evolving more from there.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Why do you think there aren’t more streamers and vtubers going all out in this particular way?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> I do think there are a lot of people going all out in different dimensions. I think some people go really all out in making their stream as close to a game as possible, or role-playing, or just being a really good vtuber. Especially in 2023 and 2024, people have really been waking up to what you can do. That's why I started <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1743439572594499783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding [and highlighting] people doing really crazy things</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think the unique thing that I'm trying to pursue that I only see a handful of people doing is [a] continued thread from the BlizzCon stream. It's this idea that, on a very surface level, it's like a roleplay stream, right? Chat is in on the RP, and the streamer is in on the RP. The simplest way to think about it is almost like a “chat plays D&amp;D” thing with the streamer with text to speech. You're the Dungeon Master, and then you guide chat through different things. I've done a “chat plays D&amp;D” concept, and I actually don't use D&amp;D rules. It's completely made-up RP; I'll show a troll, and I’ll pretend to be a troll, and then they will ask me to do something – like try to marry me or kiss me – and there’s no dice roll. I'm just like, “No, I'm gonna fucking eat you.” It's all the moment.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I played D&amp;D with Twitch Chat text-to-speech, and they kept trying to complete fetch quests with DoorDash. </p><p> It did not exist during this time period. <a href="https://t.co/P9NcOBQEio">pic.twitter.com/P9NcOBQEio</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1803284846992826410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>I think I'm really influenced by the whole tabletop gaming community around story games, which is generally more mechanic-light than D&amp;D, but very rich in narrative and story. So when I bring that to streaming it's like trying to evoke a strong sense of being somewhere, a strong sense of scene – like the Hilton hotel. The Hilton hotel lobby is a really great example for that, because so many Blizzard fans have [a strong attachment to it]. You can even smell the lobby if you think about it. That is the thread I'm trying to keep pulling on – like we're not just in a stream, or you're not watching a screen. We can suspend disbelief, and we are in a place that has very strong and evocative aesthetics, experiences, etc.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Which experiments of yours have been most successful in evoking that sense of place?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>The D&amp;D one and the BlizzCon one. With the BlizzCon one, people will come back to me and say, “This was an amazing stream.” When I think about streamers, they have to consistently do the same thing. They’re the best game player or variety streamer, or doing funny events. But the BlizzCon stream can never happen again. But it’s embedded in so many people’s memories in such a strong way that people come up to me and keep telling me about it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I made Twitch Chat into a Mecha Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ltJRiFNaoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More recently, what I’m really enjoying is this thing around turning our stream into a mech anime where each person [in chat] is a different pilot. It’s incorporating an actual game into it, which helps ground it. It’s not just anything goes. It’s grounded in something real. And I just like old mecha anime.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: More generally, what’s your favorite recent experiment, regardless of how well it evokes a sense of place?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>Recreating the infinite monkey theorem with Twitch chat. They can each type one word and have to complete works of literature. It wasn't too bad to make, but it was built on the past few years of experimenting.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I gave Twitch Chat infinite typewriters" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsU3MmhkBTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Aftermath: Did chat succeed? Did they complete any works of literature?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>They did. They completed "Hello from Twitch chat," "It was the best of times," and "To be, or not to be." I mean, it took maybe four-to-six hours total, but they did it. That's definitely less than an infinite amount of time.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: At this point, do you think vtubing is the most consistently innovative area of livestreaming? I’ve seen regular streamers </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-viewers-control-streamer-s-life-sims-style-1847517788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>do some pretty wild things</strong></a><strong>, but many of them are bigger names with, like, entire production crews behind them. It seems like what you’re doing is way less resource-intensive, which makes it more accessible.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> I mean, I’m most familiar with vtubing. The streamers that I feature are ones I’m kind of naturally drawn to. So for me, vtubing is where all the interesting things are happening because on a fundamental level, it’s easier to make a channel point that throws a rock at a vtuber’s avatar and nobody gets hurt versus doing that for a real person. Not to say that injury is innovation, but there are things that can be done digitally that can’t [otherwise].&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I created a codec overlay for Metal Gear Solid streams, where I can talk to Twitch Chat for support.   </p><p>They couldn't stay focused on the mission objective to rescue President Baker. <a href="https://t.co/OuTZvR61xq">pic.twitter.com/OuTZvR61xq</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1816924470948589891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>But I think more streamers in general are trying to go deeper on interactive streams. I think the thread everyone collectively is pulling on are things like Sammi [streaming assistant] and Streamer.bot [interactivity tools], and vtubers are adding an extra flavor to it given that their avatars can be flipped upside down, and they can have things thrown at them, and they can be in different spaces. Whereas flesh streamers will have to think of different ways to interact. Like, there was a guy who, every time you subscribed, bubbles got blown in his face. But that’s a bit more complicated to do.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Do you think you’ll ever pivot to a less chaotic, subject-to-change streaming format, or do you consider consistent inconsistency to be one of your strengths?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>This year I’m trying to stick on ideas longer, because sometimes people on Twitter or Discord will tell me “I really liked the stream you did, and I just missed it.” And I just don't do it again. I haven't done a D&amp;D stream in a while. So I want to do ideas more consistently, because it gets more people to experience them, and now that more people are stopping by, it just makes sense. That's just a quirk of myself: I do things for a bit, and then I try the next thing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I gave Twitch Chat the ability to call down Strategems for Helldivers 2 streams. </p><p>These Strategems effect the stream layout in different ways. </p><p>None of which are helpful at all. <a href="https://t.co/urLWBlfgSh">pic.twitter.com/urLWBlfgSh</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1760586048646897851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The only goal I have to keep growing is, I have a few ideas I think are interesting, and it’s just a matter of going down the list and completing them – exploring what makes them interesting. Everything else afterward is super nice. Whatever happens happens, but it’s really just tapping into ideas one by one.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Of the vtubers you’ve highlighted on Twitter, do you have any favorites? Or any you’re most inspired by in your own creations?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>One streamer I’ve been watching for a while that I do take a lot of inspiration from is <a href="https://x.com/pickychannel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PickyChannel</a>. She was one of the first streamers I’ve seen that had super evocative scenes in the sense that she really pushed the envelope to really frame her avatar like she’s in a place. She does these streams where she’s watching a walking-around-Japan video, but will move her avatar in a way that looks very natural. Like if you look at it for two seconds, you’re like “Wait, is she actually there?”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The way this vtuber controls their model in such a way that it blends seamlessly into the video, while livestreaming, is actual artistry.</p><p>I'm literally shaking from watching this. <a href="https://t.co/PJzO2TruJm">pic.twitter.com/PJzO2TruJm</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1729004282647896112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Every vtuber I’ve featured has spawned from this, because I’m like “If you like this, I know plenty more with similar vibes to this.” Her channel has&nbsp; really great framing around, like, she’s on a train and talking [and] a lot of walking streams. Concepts of being on vacation – things like that. They’re kind of like chatting streams, but they’re meant to make you feel like you’re there with her on the train or on the beach just having a conversation, you know?</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm in awe over this this stream overlay that is completely hand drawn and water colored. </p><p>It's not just "an overlay", it's an entirely interactive town for her vtuber and chat to inhabit.

So Julieee, the lore is that she’s the mayor of this doodle town, and she moves place to place and talks to these different NPCs who can be chat or text to speech. And yeah, it’s crazy – completely mind melting. It’s insane that someone not only drew this world, but they are now walking around and bringing you around for the story.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This streamer's overlay made my brain explode. </p><p>A living and breathing world, with a huge amount of custom redeems. </p><p>They basically redraw their character to make sure its cohesive with every scene. That is dedication. </p><p>This showcases what is truly possible with livestreaming. <a href="https://t.co/E5JlnUof5M">pic.twitter.com/E5JlnUof5M</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1731105265905520704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Tyjiro is doing something similar: putting a lot of effort into building this world around him. But I think the thing that makes him unique is, depending on where he is in the world, he redraws his avatar for whatever scene he’s in. He’s not 3D, so he can’t just rotate himself around the Y axis. He could have been 3D; that’s better tech for moving around the world and looking around, but the style of him being this cartoon character that changes frames – like more of a traditional cartoon – really works for the stream.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: What are your goals and ambitions for vtubing at this point? What do you want to focus on next?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>Adding more concepts around live music in vtubing. And like, that’s not a thing that is new. There are vtuber concerts happening all the time, vtubers doing karaoke. They build grand stages. They’re evoking a sense of place, too – so none of that is new. But for me, it’s about pursuing, like, being the guy at a party subjecting everyone to your YouTube algorithm. You’re like “I love this music, and you’re gonna listen to it” or “I love this YouTube video; we’re gonna see it.” Most concerts that I think people watch are idol concerts and things like that, which I think are excellent. They’re super grandiose and awesome. But the other side of that is, who’s doing the vtuber noise concert where their avatar gets completely distorted along with the sound?&nbsp;</p><p>I think the one ambition I do have is showing people what’s possible. And I’m not the only guy, right? I think for some people, it’s like “Oh, he’s the guy who’s doing that.” But I think part of the ambition is for myself to show what’s possible in the livestreaming and vtuber space and [the other part] is to highlight people who are doing the same. I think it’s really gratifying to spotlight other people, and people getting excited about that is really fun.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Instead of banning disruptive chatters, I've tried having a heart-to-heart. </p><p>I created an overlay so we can hug it out, with a special gift for hearing me out. <a href="https://t.co/jkOGZ7MMwA">pic.twitter.com/jkOGZ7MMwA</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1821447921268879849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>It’s a whole new canvas that involves a collaboration with your community and viewers. The closest analog I can think of is, it’s almost like game development. The scale at which some of these people are producing their streams is almost like making a new video game. But it’s not exactly a video game, right? Because there’s a viewer-streamer dynamic. There’s a chat. But in many ways it is like a video game because there’s role-play and interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>All the exaggerated stuff I write online [when spotlighting creators], I kind of believe that on a deep level. At first I thought it’d be funny to write something clickbait-y, but at the same time, that is how I really feel. I truly, sincerely feel that about these creators. I really am that hyped up about them. It makes me extra happy that people are paying attention, because I just do this bullshit to my friends. I used to just send them clips like this on Discord, or one time people were at my house and I had a stream on, and I was like “Look at this one! It looks like they run their stream through an actual fucking VCR, dude! That’s crazy!” And they were like “Yeah, that’s kinda cool.” So now I’m basically subjecting everyone to my tastes, which is awesome.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Back to School</em></a><em> is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

                <p>One of the biggest new features in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a>'s Max Out season is Dynamaxing--a phenomenon first introduced in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-sword-shield/" data-ref-id="5000-465594">Pokemon Sword and Shield</a>. Dynamaxing supersizes a Pokemon to gigantic proportions, giving them a power boost and access to some unique moves to use during battle.</p><p>Like other features from the mainline Pokemon series, Dynamaxing works a little differently in Pokemon Go than it does in Sword and Shield, so here's a rundown on how to earn Max Particles and Dynamax your Pokemon.</p><h2>Which Pokemon can Dynamax?</h2><p>While any Pokemon is capable of Dynamaxing in Pokemon Sword and Shield, only select monsters can do so in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Specifically, only Pokemon caught in Max Battles or around Power Spots have the ability to Dynamax, meaning you can't Dynamax the Pokemon you already have. You can tell if a Pokemon is capable of Dynamaxing by the Dynamax symbol on their lookup screen.</p><p>As mentioned, Pokemon that spawn around Power Spots are capable of Dynamaxing, as are Pokemon you battle and catch in Max Battles. You can also get a couple of Dynamax Pokemon by completing the "To The Max" Special Research quest you receive at the start of the season.</p><h3>To The Max Special Research Tasks</h3><p><strong>Step 1 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Collect MP from 3 Power Spots - 30 Poke Balls</li><li>Explore 5 km - 20 Great Balls</li><li>Collect 500 Max Particles - 10 Ultra Balls</li><li><strong>Reward</strong>: Dynamax Wooloo encounter and 8,000 XP</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Collect MP from 10 Power Spots - 100 Max Particles</li><li>Collection 1,000 Max Particles - 2 Golden Razz Berries</li><li>Level up 1 Max Move - 5 Rare Candies</li><li><strong>Reward:</strong> Dynamax Skwovet encounter and 8,000 XP</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Win a Max Battle - 100 Max Particles</li><li>Unlock a Max Move - 10 Ultra Balls</li><li>Win 3 Max Battles - 2 Pinap Berries</li><li>Catch a Max Pokemon - 2,500 Stardust</li><li><strong>Reward:</strong> Dynamax Band avatar item, 8,000 XP, and 4,000 Stardust</li></ul><h2>How to get Max Particles</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365089" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365089"></a><figcaption>Power Spots and Max Particles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg"></figure><p>In order to Dynamax your Pokemon, you must first collect a new type of energy called Max Particles. You can earn Max Particles by completing the "To the Max" Special Research mentioned above, as well as by interacting with Power Spots around the map. Max Particles are also sold through Pokemon Go's in-game item shop.</p><h2>Max Battles</h2><p>Once you've collected enough Max Particles, you can Dynamax a compatible Pokemon by participating in a Max Battle--a new type of raid that occurs at Power Spots.</p><p>To enter a Max Battle, you must spend a certain amount of Max Particles, depending on the strength of the raid boss. As you battle the boss, you will gradually fill your Pokemon's Max Meter at the top of the screen. Once the meter is full, your Pokemon will Dynamax for three turns, allowing you to use Max Moves for the duration of its transformation.</p><p>If you successfully defeat the raid boss, you'll earn a variety of rewards, including a chance to catch the Dynamax Pokemon you just battled. You can also place one of your own Dynamax Pokemon at that Power Spot to earn candy and assist other players who challenge a Max Battle at that location with a damage bonus.</p><h2>Max Moves</h2><p>When transformed, Dynamax Pokemon are able to use exclusive attacks known as Max Moves. Each Dynamax Pokemon starts with one Max Move, whose type is based on your Pokemon's Fast Attack. By spending candy and Max Particles, you can power up your Dynamax Pokemon and learn two additional Max Moves: Max Spirit and Max Guard.</p><p>Max Spirit is a support move that heals both your Pokemon and your allies during battle. Max Guard, on the other hand, is a defensive move that decreases the damage you take from the raid boss. You can level up each Max Move to improve its effects.</p><p>There's plenty more happening during Pokemon Go's Max Out season.

During the 9-minute-long technical presentation, system architect Mark Cerny showed us all the new features, from advanced ray tracing to an upgraded GPU, and the upcoming console’s ability to hit higher frame rates at high resolutions. Some gamers are ecstatic that the PS5 Pro (which costs more than any other game console ever has) can produce beautiful graphics at the highly sought after 60fps, but I couldn’t care less. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I just want my console or PC to run my favorite video games without overheating, blowing up, or crashing—I do not give a shit if a leaf in the background of <em>Spider-Man 2</em> is sharper on the PS5 Pro, and quite frankly, I didn’t see much of a difference during the presentation. I can’t justify spending more on a video game console than I do during a quarterly Botox session, especially when the purported improvements seem barely discernible to the naked eye.<br></p><p>At a certain point in the presentation, Cerny compared the visuals of a variety of games running on both the PS5’s performance mode (which favors frame rates over graphics) and the PS5 Pro. “What we see here is a difference in detail,” Cerny says as a clip shows Ellie from <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> aiming down sights. I caught myself leaning in so close to my monitor my eyes went slightly wonky. The difference in detail? You can kind of read a sign tacked to a tower 50 yards away. Is this going to fundamentally change your gaming experience? Will the ability to read the warning on a watchtower help me better understand the dangers of contributing to a cycle of violence? I don’t think so.</p><p>“My favorite is the parade scene from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>,” Cerny says, showing another side-by-side comparison of the PS5 in performance mode versus the PS5 Pro. “Distant details are much clearer.” The camera zooms in on the crowd of aliens populating the stands in the background of the scene, and though they are definitely sharper and more in-focus on the PS5 Pro, I once again ask: Does this matter? If I was in the midst of playing through this moment, would I stop to wonder at the fidelity of a bug-eyed alien waving in the stands?<br></p><p>There are some gamers who are frame rate and fidelity sickos (one of them works at <em>Kotaku</em>, and he goes by Zack Zwiezen), and I guess I can see why the PS5 Pro is their shit. I <em>did</em> let out a quiet “ooo” at a bright yellow car reflecting in the paint of a black car driving next to it in <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>during the presentation. And for games where frame rates are key and stuttering or input latency can break immersion or even cause you to die or lose, I can wrap my head around why, maybe, you’d be amped to see a game running at 60fps with gorgeous graphics.<br></p><p>But with a $700 price tag (and no disc drive, you need to fork over an extra $80 for that) and only slightly discernible differences in terms of graphics and frame rates, I just can’t bring myself to get excited over the PS5 Pro. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following Ubisoft's decision to shut down The Crew's servers earlier this year - a move made even more controversial when it began revoking players' licensing to the game - the publisher has announced plans to prevent other entries in the open-world racing series from suffering a similar fate by retroactively introducing offline modes.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">delisting The Crew from digital storefronts</a> last December, announcing it would be permanently shutting the game's servers down on 31st March this year. Unfortunately, its always-online nature meant players didn't just loose access to The Crew's multiplayer elements when the day came - all its single-player content became unavailable too. 
</p>
<p>
The controversy surrounding Ubisoft's decision led to revitalised discourse on video games preservation, and the establishment of Stop Killing Games - an initiative <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">aiming to mount political and legal challenges</a> to the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable. And debate only intensified when Ubisoft later began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">quietly revoking owners' licenses</a> to The Crew, making it impossible to download and install.

<p>
Five months on, Ubisoft has finally acknowledged player concerns around access - or rather, the complete lack of access - to The Crew in a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739">statement on social media</a>. And while it doesn't sound like there's much hope for the original The Crew's revival, the publisher is at least looking to protect its sequels.
</p>
<p>
"We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games," the publisher wrote on Twitter/X. "Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest." It then confirmed "an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles" is in the works, promising more details "in the next months". 
</p>
<p>
In response to today's news, Stop Killing Games founder and YouTuber Ross Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1833575742854340839">wrote</a>, "The Crew 2 and Motorsport is getting an offline mode. Hopefully this is in response to consumer agencies in multiple countries investigating the legality of them disabling [The Crew 1], which was sold as a one-time purchase with no stated expiration date."

			<p>Genshin Impact is a gacha game that continues to take the world by storm, with new updates coming out regularly<span>.&nbsp;</span><span>After years of being on PC, mobile, and PlayStation, the game is finally making <a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/">its way onto Xbox</a></span>. By using the codes provided by the Genshin Impact developers, you'll get free rewards such as Mora, Hero's Wit, Primogems, and Adventurer's Experience. There are many codes, but make sure to use them as soon as possible, as they are usually time-gated and will expire, meaning you won't be able to get rewards if you try to redeem them.</p>
<p>Here are all of the current active Genshin Impact codes for September 2024 and the rewards you can get for redeeming them.</p>
<h2>All Active Genshin Impact Codes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>GENSHINGIFT</strong>&nbsp;- x50 Primogems and x3 Hero's Wit</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Genshin Impact Codes</h2>
<p>While it may seem daunting, redeeming Genshin Impact codes is simple and only requires you to follow a couple of steps. The main pre-requisite you need to meet is <strong>Adventurer Level 10</strong>. Without it, you won't be able to redeem codes. This is a relatively easy requirement to meet and won't take you too long to reach.</p>
<p>To redeem codes, you must go to the <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Genshin Impact website</a>, where you can log in to your server and redeem them.</p>
<p>On the website, you'll be prompted to fill out three boxes. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Character Nickname</li>
<li>Redemption Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've completed all of those, you press the Redeem button, and the rewards will be sent to your mail in-game.</p>

But for most, the headliner of the patch is the ending update that adds new conclusions for the evil choice you can make at the end of the game. Precisely what happens after you make this decision will depend on a few factors, primarily whether you’re playing as one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-gale-romance-origin-shadowheart-popular-1850730799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-gale-romance-origin-shadowheart-popular-1850730799">origin characters</a></span> or as a custom protagonist. But even within those distinctions, there are some slight variations. Let’s break down each of the new endings. Spoilers ahead!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><p>If you’re playing as a custom character, your tyrannical ending is pretty straightforward initially. If, after fighting through the streets of Baldur’s Gate and defeating the final boss, you decide to take control of the Netherbrain, you gain absolute domination over the Illlithid army it once commanded. What you do with this newfound power will determine which of the dark, even disturbing endings you get. But you may have to pass one constitution check to get much choice in the matter. The possible outcomes include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If you consumed too many Mind Flayer Parasite specimens throughout your playthrough, you’ll have to pass a constitution check before you can make any decisions about where the game will wrap up. If you fail this, your character will turn into a mind flayer and will start fitting the citizens of Baldur’s Gate with tadpoles of their own. That’s the price of hubris, I suppose.</li><li>If taking over one world wasn’t enough for you, one choice you can make is to command the citizens of Baldur’s Gate as your personal army. Your character will force the people to take up arms in your name as you wage war on every other realm to expand your rule.</li><li>Not every evil ending has to end in violence, however. You can also choose to brainwash the people to serve you. Ignorant of what’s been done to them, they will happily rebuild the city to honor you, their savior. </li><li>The last two endings are some of the most disturbing. If you deem the citizens of Baldur’s Gate beneath you, you can execute them all with a flick of your wrist. Then your character just lays in all the carnage, basking in it.</li><li>The final ending is the most brutal. For those playing chaotic evil characters who don’t even care about ruling or mercy killing, you can send the people of Baldur’s Gate on a murderous frenzy through the city streets as you revel in the violence. </li></ul><p>All the origin characters can choose any of the above endings, but they also get an additional choice specifically tied to their stories. Let’s break those down.<br></p></div><div><p>Shadowheart’s story throughout <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>revolves around her crisis of faith at the center of two warring goddesses. If she gains the power of the Netherbrain, she can decide to become a goddess herself, creating a new church “united, in [her] image, and blessed with the blood of the faithless.”<br></p></div><div><p>Ever the jilted ex of a goddess, Gale’s evil ending has him set his sights squarely on the gods of Faerûn. With the Netherbrain subdued, the wizard looks to level the pantheon of gods with an army of brainwashed followers at his beck and call.<br></p></div><div><p>While Shadowheart and Gale are ready to fight gods, Wyll’s evil ending is a bit more ground level, though no less heinous in his manipulation of all of mankind. The Blade of Frontiers looks to subdue the citizens of Baldur’s Gate and rule over the people he once protected. He’s shown turning people into subservient mind flayers, even his own father.<br></p></div><div><p>Given how kind and caring Karlach usually is, I find it hard to even imagine an evil ending for her, but the conclusion Larian went with effectively pulls at some of the emotional threads of the Tiefling Barbarian’s history. Having been mistreated and outcast in Baldur’s Gate, she returns to the city to inflict the same pain onto its citizens that she felt in being rejected by them.<br></p></div><div><p>In most of Lae’zel’s endings, she seeks to overthrow Vlaakith, the ruler of the Githyanki. In her evil ending, she merely expedites the process with a mind-controlled force, leading an ambush on the queen on dragonback.<br></p></div><div><p>The handsome vampire bastard’s shift to full-blown evil is one of the easiest such turns to buy in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s new endings. If Astarion controls the Netherbrain, he becomes a king, using his rule to feed on his loyal subjects.<br></p></div><div><p>If, as the Dark Urge, you choose to give into your violent impulses one last time, your fate will be sealed. You are destined to commit wanton destruction, killing everything in sight until you eventually are the last living creature.<br></p></div><div><p>Also included in the new endings are a few variations for those who romanced the Emperor and chose to take over the world with the Netherbrain’s power. You can choose to rule together, or attempt to betray him.</p><hr><p>Well, there you have it. Look at all the awful shit you can make my babies do. Wouldn’t you rather the game end with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-new-ending-epilogue-patch-5-1851063292">everyone hanging out at camp</a></span>, reminiscing about the good ol’ days and catching up on what each of you have done in the time since?

Amazon-owned retailer Woot has brought back one of its popular deals on three-month subscriptions. For the next three days--or until Woot sells out--you can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-94-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-compared-to-new-price%2F1100-6526404%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for $36.49</a></strong>, which breaks down to $12.16 per month--substantially less than the $20 price that goes into effect this Thursday.</p><p>One-month codes are also available at Woot, though these are more expensive at $13.79 each. Though there's technically a limit on the number of codes you can buy, we highly doubt you want 24 three-month codes. You may want more than one, though.

After the price increase, three months of Xbox Game Pass will cost you $60, so this is still a solid offer.</p><p>Other Game Pass price increases include PC Game Pass increasing from $10 to $12 per month, and the annual price of Xbox Game Pass Core is going from $60 to $75 a year. The $10 monthly subscription price will remain unaffected for that leaner gaming library. Alongside its collection of monthly Game Pass titles, this year's upcoming Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a>, will also be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-leak-reveals-its-coming-to-game-pass-day-one/1100-6523742/" data-ref-id="1100-6523742">included in Game Pass on release day</a>. You'll also be able to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preorder-guide/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on Game Pass when it launches December 9.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">launched Game Pass Standard</a> on September 10. The $15/month subscription includes access hundreds of games, online multiplayer, and other perks--but you don't get day-one exclusives like Indiana Jones until a later date. At the moment, Woot's or even Amazon's Game Pass Ultimate deals are obviously the better purchase. </p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Activision has revealed Season 6 for Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile, and like with past seasons, this one also has a new BlackCell DLC offering. The headliner of the latest BlackCell bundle is an operator named "Alone," who is something of a monster.</p><p>Alone is described as a "three-headed zombified mutation" of the character Ghost, and as you can see in the image below, the character certainly lives up to that grisly description. It's a fitting and timely operator, as Season 6 also coincides with the return of Call of Duty's annual Halloween-themed Haunting event that brings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-myers-returns-to-call-of-duty-in-season-6-of-warzone-and-mw3/1100-6526390/" data-ref-id="1100-6526390">all manner of spooky elements to the game like Michael Myers</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365034" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365034"></a><figcaption>Season 6's BlackCell DLC has been revealed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4365034-mwiii-s6-announcement-051%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Pricing was not disclosed in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/09/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-6-haunting-returns-maps-modes-zombies-announcement#BlackCell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's blog post</a>, but previous BlackCell bundles sold for $30, and it's expected that will be the price for this one as well.</p><p>Buying the BlackCell bundle gets users access to a BlackCell-specific part of the Season 6 Battle Map, and comes with 20 instant tier skips, along with an allotment of 1,100 COD Points, the aforementioned Alone operator, and the "Ghost Charmer BlackCell" blueprint for the STG44 Assault Rifle with "Chromatographic" tracers and "Cenotaph Slam" death effect. The bundle also comes with the "Maximum Aspect BlackCell" blueprint for the Rival-9 SMG. It also has a new finishing move called "Throat Rip," and it's not hard to imagine what that might entail.</p><p>Additionally, everyone who buys the new BlackCell bundle gets special, BlackCell-specific rewards in the Season 6 battle pass, including:</p><ul><li>10 Operator Skins for: Farah (x2), Michael Myers (x1), Makarov (x1), Banshee (x1), Valeria (x1), Slamfire (x1), Dokkaebi (x1), Riptide (x1), Jabber (x1)</li><li>6 Weapon Blueprints with Chromatographic Tracers and Cenotaph Slam Dismemberment Death Effects</li></ul><p>Anyone who buys BlackCell after purchasing the Season 6 battle pass will get 1,100 COD Points back.</p><p>Season 6 launches on September 18 for Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile, as all three games share progression.

			<p>A couple of hours ago, the official Focus Entertainment Twitter/X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1833537959326339304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1833537959326339304%7Ctwgr%5Edb17e9dc9db64f3f0c366b2ff0ed3dd966bc624d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsogaming.com%2Fnews%2Fwarhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-two-million-copies%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has already sold two million units.</p>
<p>The long-anticipated sequel only launched yesterday, so it's likely the number is due, in large part, to the pre-orders. Indeed, during my Gamescom 2024 chat with Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits, the industry veteran <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We're very proud of where it is now. We're very happy with our work, and the people who played the preview were happy. Preorders are great. Right now, what we're focused on is September 9, you know, making sure that the servers are up and running for everyone, making sure that any issues are ironed up, but everything's looking good; it's all green lights. The game is fun and solid, so yeah, I'm excited about the launch.</em></p>
<p>So far, user reviews are largely positive on Steam. However, our own Chris Wray wasn't quite enamored with Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, giving the game 7 out of 10 in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>In all, while Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel. It&nbsp;is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>The developers already promised a lengthy <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a>, with lots of content coming, as well as frame rate-enhancing features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS3 and AMD FSR 3</a>.</p>

<p>When you imagine a side-scrolling adventure, it’s usually not a complex game. You move across the screen, slaying monsters and completing objectives from point A to point B. A few Towerborne tips and tricks should serve you well in your adventures beyond The Belfry, and Insider Gaming intends to take this adventure alongside you!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-towerborne">What is Towerborne?</h2>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-adventure game with RPG elements from Stoic, the developers behind The Banner Saga. You take on the role of a hero, an Ace, born of spirits and with incredible abilities to defeat the monsters encroaching upon The Belfry. You’ll venture out—solo or with a party of up to three other players—to explore new lands, acquire powerful gear, and defeat creatures of varying sizes and difficulties. If you intend to venture alone, you can hire Umbra—unique companions joining you in combat and enhancing your abilities.</p>



<p>But it’s not all fighting. Towerborne features an untold number of quests, the ability to reforge your equipment to become more powerful, and other RPG mechanics that promise to keep players enjoying the experience for years, according to the studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-towerborne-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players">Towerborne Tips and Tricks for New Players</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite its simplicity on the surface, Towerborne does offer complex mechanics and a few confusing design choices that have new players scratching their heads. We’re here to help with a handful of Towerborne tips and tricks!</p>



<ol>
<li>You don’t need to rush into combat. While the enemies prove squishy in the early game, some of them hit hard. They telegraph their tells, so learn your foe’s moveset, watch for their wind-up, and know when to dodge forward, backward, or strike to interrupt attacks.</li>



<li>Don’t fret over character creation too much, as part of the lore revolves around you being essentially immortal, which means you can alter your appearance anytime you wish from the hub area!</li>



<li>You can switch classes anytime, so long as you’re not in the middle of a mission, so experiment with the four available—Sentinel, Pyroclast, Rockbreaker, and Shadowstriker—to figure out which one meshes well with your preferred play style. They all feature unique abilities and weapons, allowing for plenty of variety.</li>



<li>Learn the game’s various roles and how they fit into a party-based environment. For example, the Sentinel excels as a frontline fighter that takes the brunt of the attack, while the Pyroclast moves up in the second slot to deal heavy damage to groups with its fire-based heavy attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>As we continue playing Towerborne, we’ll update this tips and tricks guide with additional insights!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hp-prebuilt-gaming-pc-deal-vs-ps5-pro-price-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For a limited time, Walmart (via the HP Store) is offering an <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVlYo?object_uuid=bd621eba-dc4d-4cea-983f-9cc90cb56f9d&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HP Victus</a> gaming PC equipped with the GeForce RTX 4060 GPU for only $749.99 shipped after a $450 instant discount. This is a solid 1080p gaming PC at an incredible price; in fact, I don't think we've ever seen another gaming PC equipped with an RTX 4060 GPU for cheaper.</p><h2>HP Victus RTX 4060 Gaming PC for $749.99</h2><div id="196408" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>HP Victus 15L Intel Core i5-1440F RTX 4060 Gaming PC with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</h3></p></div><p>This Victus is HP's budget line of gaming PCs. It might be as flashy as the OMEN series, but it's a good looking compact chassis with adequate cooling and - depending on how it is specc'ed - equally as competent. This particular model features an Intel Core i5-14400F CPU, GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Intel Core i5-14400F processor is Intel's newest generation CPU and features a Max Turbo frequency of 4.7GHz with 10 cores, 16 threads, and 20MB of total cache. This is a good gaming chip that won't bottleneck your RTX 4060 GPU.</p><p>The RTX 4060 is considerably more powerful than the RTX 3060 and almost nearly matches the RTX 3060 Ti. I would recommend this card for comfortable 1080p gaming. You could also run games at 1440p with relaxed graphic settings, but at that point I'd recommend upgrading to an RTX 4060 Ti or higher. Because it's a current generation card, the RTX 4060 supports <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-nvidia-dlss-meaning">DLSS 3.0</a>. It gives you a very nice framerate boost without sacrificing too much visual quality. It's basically like selecting Peformance mode instead of Quality mode on your PS5 gaming console.</p><p>For those of you on a budget, the RTX 4060 is going to be your best NVIDIA GPU that you're going to find for under $1000, and this HP Victus is well under that threshold. What's more, this is a pre-built HP config with a manufacturer's warranty, so you'll avoid the hassle of building DIY and dealing with component warranties.

Although the price of the PS5 Pro and this PC are pretty similar and they can both play games well, it's certainly not an apples to apples comparison. We actually wrote a lengthy article on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-pc-vs-console-differences">tradeoffs between console gaming and PC gaming</a> in general, but here's a quick list of bullet points comparing these two models specifically.</p><h3>The advantages of the PlayStation 5 Pro</h3><p>(1) Full access to the hundreds of games in the PS5 library</p><p>(2) Plug and play right out of the box</p><p>(3) Better performance; able to play games at legit 4K</p><p>(4) More storage capacity (2TB standard)</p><p>(5) VR capable with a PSVR2</p><h3>The disadvantages of the PlayStation 5 Pro</h3><p>(1) The PlayStation 5 Slim exists and costs $250 less</p><p>(2) Most games are expensive and it adds up fast</p><p>(3) No disc drive (costs extra), so you can't play 4K Blu-ray movies</p><p>(4) One trick pony; doesn't do much else besides being a gaming and multimedia device</p><p>(5) No future upgradeability</p><p>(6) Wonky keyboard/mouse support</p><h3>The advantages of this gaming PC</h3><p>(1) Full access to tens of thousands of games on the PC</p><p>(2) General utility (more than just a gaming box)</p><p>(3) Plenty of affordable games that are just as good as the AAA titles</p><p>(4) Future upgradeability</p><p>(5) Prebuilt so mostly plug and play</p><p>(6) VR capable with a Meta Quest, Valve Index, HTC Vive, etc</p><p>(7) Universal keyboard/mouse and controller support</p><h3>The disadvantages of this gaming PC</h3><p>(1) An RTX 4060 on a Windows OS can realistically run games at 1080p-1440p, <strong>not 4K</strong></p><p>(2) Much less plug and play friendly than a gaming console</p><p>(3) Doesn't include a disc drive either</p><p><em>Looking for more alternatives?
