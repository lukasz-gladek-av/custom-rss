However, the latest RTX 5090 Founders Edition card that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">we are currently testing</a> achieves its goals through a modular four-part design with a separate I/O board that allows air to flow through for a more efficient and compact cooler. According to Nvidia, these changes are why the new 5090 fits in two slots on the motherboard compared to the previous three-slot 4090. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced today that it is revising its outlook for the fiscal year after a slowdown in Global Football net bookings growth, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard missed the company's internal targets by nearly 50%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a press release,</a> the company said it was reducing its expectations for the fiscal year ending March of 2025 from mid-single-digit growth to mid-single-digit decline. The largest culprit, EA says, was global football, aka EA Sports FC, which it says experienced a slowdown last year in Q3 after two consecutive fiscal years of double-digit net bookings growth. In the press release, EA CEO Andrew Wilson specifically pointed to EA Sports FC 25 as underperforming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in addition to global football, EA also mentioned that Dragon Age "engaged" 1.5 million players during the quarter, which was down nearly 50% from the company's projections. Notably, EA does not say the 1.5 million number was unit sales - Dragon Age: The Veilguard was also available as a part of EA's Play Pro subscription service. Additionally, it's not clear whether EA is counting a free trial of the game that was available through the cheaper EA Play subscription in the 1.5 million number either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard released on October 31, 2024, and EA's report only covers the final quarter of the year through the end of December, meaning these engagement totals encompass the game's first two months on the market. It's worth noting that 1.5 million (or thereabouts) isn't an awful sales number, and companies overestimating sales targets is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-looks-to-assassins-creed-for-future-salvation-amid-challenging-year">nothing new</a>. In its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">first three days on the market</a>, The Veilguard managed to debut at No.6 on Circana's charts for the top-selling games in the US, and that's not including Steam digital sales. However, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-faces-uphill-battle-to-match-inquisitions-launch-sales-says-analyst">analyst we spoke to in November</a> suggested that Veilguard had tough road ahead:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just looking at the first days of sales and initial engagement levels via Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, it's been a good - but not great - launch," said Mat Piscatella at Circana. "Dragon Age: The Veilguard did not reach the launch week sales levels of either Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Dragon's Dogma II, and it will be a bit of an uphill battle to reach Inquisition's lifetime sales."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been some smoke around Dragon Age: The Veilguard's struggles, such as it receiving a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-cyber-monday-deal-2024">significant discount just a month after launch</a> for Cyber Monday, and the departure of its director, Corinne Busche, from BioWare just last week. We've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">chronicled some of the game's development challenges already</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">layoffs</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-4-creative-director-left-bioware">departure</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-to-leave-studio-all-current-projects-planned-to-continue">several project leads</a> at different stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">thought Dragon Age: The Veilguard was amazing</a>, saying it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-talk-weapon-changes-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Players prepare themselves each time a new Monster Hunter is released, wondering how their favorite weapon will feel in their hands in the upcoming game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the 14 weapon types displays its own unique characteristics while still changing to fit the design of each new title. Monster Hunter: World did away with segmenting off each area during a quest, while Monster Hunter Rise is notable for its Wirebug action. The weapons that feel at home in the hunters' hands show a new side of themselves in line with a game's design. So, what kinds of concepts guided the tuning of each weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds, a game that aims to create a seamless hunting experience?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To hear about these weapon details that act as determining gameplay factors, we spoke with the Monster Hunter Wilds art director and executive director, Kaname Fujioka, and Wilds director, Yuya Tokuda. Fujioka was also the director of the first Monster Hunter game, while Tokuda has had a hand in the series since Monster Hunter Freedom. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, we heard about the concept and development process for various weapons, garnering new details on weapons that players have been particularly interested in, as well as the kinds of adjustments made for the release version of the game after the feedback they received from the November 2024 Open Beta Test.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Adjustments for a Seamless World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda starts by saying that significant changes needed to be made to how a number of weapons are used due to major shifts in the gameplay loop, affected by Wilds’ seamless map and changing weather conditions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are a number of large changes to the Light and Heavy Bowgun, as well as the Bow," he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While previous Monster Hunter titles featured a routine of returning to your base to replenish your resources after each quest, Wilds aims to offer seamless play, making this process no longer required. Ranged weapons in Monster Hunter historically use consumable ammo and coatings, so there was a possibility that they would be more of a burden to use in Wilds without an established time to restock these items. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's why we designed it so that basic damage sources can be used without expending resources,” says Tokuda. “We balanced it around the idea that things like normal, pierce and spread ammo for Bowguns and coatings for Bows can fire unlimited times while managing your gauge. But we still wanted it to be possible to use what you’ve prepared ahead of time or what you find in the field on top of that, and so our balancing took into account the presence of design that allows you to create powerful ammo with attributes from gathered materials."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One change after the next was made to each of the weapons while considering the new elements found in Wilds and the game's concept, with ranged weapon changes being the most notable. Fujioka says that this goes beyond playstyle and mechanics, even stretching into design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had the idea of wanting to properly show the movement of charging a Bowgun for a special shot,” he says. “Shots that cancel out a monster's attack look properly convincing as they perform that canceling. Ever since the previous game in the series, we've put a lot of work into making it visually clear to the player what they're doing in the moment."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He says that advances in technology increasing the ability to create such depictions also play a major role in these animation changes. Players can swing weapons, put them away, and switch between them. Tokuda says that adding more fine detail to the transitionary animations that connect each action changed even what hunters can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One common concept shared by all weapons is that we made sure it's possible for hunters to use them in a natural way given the situation at the moment,” he says. “Our goal was to do this particularly when you can't make any inputs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in previous games, you needed to stow your weapon and stop moving before using a healing item. The greater ability to depict actions through animations played a role in changing that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka continues: "The Focus Mode that we added to [Wilds] is something we put a lot of work into when it comes to action. You can move while facing a specified direction, making continuous attacks possible while on the move but slightly off-center from your target. Players can properly go in the direction they want. We wanted to make a game that made possible the image players have in their minds about how they want to play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There have been incredible technical leaps for the development environment in recent years, such as in managing animations, and there have been even greater changes in how games themselves are played. For action games, in particular, the question of how you meet the players’ desires to play in a certain way in the moment they actively want to make a movement is an important one. During development, we're always conscious about not being left behind by changes in the times."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Focus Strikes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One major change in Wilds is the new system that allows you to wound a monster if you continuously attack a specific spot on its body. Whether or not a wound is formed is generally determined by the amount of damage dealt to that area. Some acts wound a monster more easily, such as attacks that use environmental elements like falling rocks or battles between monsters. When it comes to attacks from player weapons, though, they generally form due to accumulated damage, which is why there aren't any differences between weapon types in this regard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunters can deal massive damage to wounded monsters by using Focus Strikes while in Focus Mode. Completely different animations were prepared for each weapon type, such as acrobatically flying all around a monster with the dual blades, making it appear at first glance like there are differences in abilities here. So do different weapons have different Focus Strike effects aside from the visuals? Tokuda gives us an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For Focus Strikes, we wanted to have animations that show each weapon's uniqueness,” he says. “But I admit that this also created a variation between weapons during the open beta test where some were far too strong, while feeling the strengths of others was difficult. Though we do allow differences between weapons in order to give them personality, we don't want the disparity between weapons to be too extreme, and so we're tuning them to be more standardized for the official release of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wound system gives hunters a new option when hunting. For example, if you're attacking the head while using a hammer to flinch a monster, the accumulated damage can create a wound there. You're then able to deal a large amount of damage by then hitting it with a Focus Strike, but that wound will turn into a scar, meaning that you can no longer create a new head wound. You can of course continue to focus on the head, or you can target another body part that can be wounded. Once players are in the latter half of the game, they will learn that there are ways to use the environment that lead to unexpected scars. Tokuda says that, like flinching and part breaking, the wound system acts as a new option for players, where they may expect to create a wound on a monster by hitting it just one more time in a certain location.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monsters are unwounded when a quest begins, but you can hunt monsters as you explore the locale in Wilds, so as the situation in the locale changes, monsters can have turf wars even without a hunter's involvement,” he says. “This means that a monster may already have multiple wounds by the time it interacts with the player. You can think yourself lucky and hunt a monster when it's in that state. There may also be special additional rewards for felling monsters wandering the locale. In some cases, there are even monsters that give gems as additional rewards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this game, the use of Focus Mode and wounds has made it easier than before to land dramatically damaging attacks, like the Great Sword's Charged Slash. So were changes made to monster health and toughness to go along with the addition of these features?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not as if that was our intention from the start, but health did end up being a little bit higher than World once we thought about maintaining appropriate playtimes and player satisfaction, compared to past titles,” says Tokuda. “Elements like flinch resistance are also higher, but this doesn't mean that hunts will be tedious. Part of the purpose of Focus Mode is to allow players to feel more accomplished through shorter loops. We tried to design it so that the time they spend hunting is even more concentrated than before."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Tempo of the Great Sword</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can imagine that tuning each of the 14 weapon types requires quite a lot of development work. We asked Tokuda if each weapon type had a dedicated director or designer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are some staff members who oversee multiple weapon types, which ultimately makes for about six individual planners, who are responsible for player experience,” he replies. “We don't just have game designers, of course. We include artists and animation designers to discuss details like what kinds of movements would be good and how that may mean a weapon could be better off used in a different way as we polish the weapons. We didn't have staff members assigned to weapons from the start; their number grows as development progresses. We generally begin by developing the Great Sword as a prototype, then verify weapons like the Sword and Shield and Heavy Bowgun, applying the knowledge we get from there to the other weapons as we create them."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Designers and artists work together to create a weapon's action as they think about how much fun it is to use along with how good it feels to look at. It seems that Focus Strikes were an inspiring idea for the art team led by Fujioka as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Attacks like the Focus Strike didn't exist in the series before, so now that we had this new form of expression available to us, we began by coming up with ideas while focusing on making it feel good over anything performance related,” Fujioka explains. “The Great Sword is an all-rounder weapon, so we generally begin with it when creating animations. It's one of the first weapons we created for the original Monster Hunter, and there's a strong sense of wanting to challenge ourselves with the Great Sword first. We felt excited when we first made the Focus Strike for the Great Sword, thinking that if we were able to create something that feels this good, we'd be able to do even more with the other weapons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that the Great Sword has an even larger presence when it comes to the development of Monster Hunter's animations than we expected. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda continues: "I feel like weapons with a sense of heavy tempo like the Great Sword are rare in other action games. That's why it's a Monster Hunter standard to begin by making sure that the Great Sword is fun to use. The concepts for the other weapons come together in part by placing the Great Sword at the center and seeing how we can differentiate each of the other weapons from it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess you could say that once you're used to the game, you'll have noticed that the Great Sword is the most rounded of them all. While the speed of weapons like the Dual Blades or the Sword and Shield will always result in there being technical elements needed in order to earn damage in small ways, you're able to go straight to defeating a monster once you're good at using the Great Sword's style as it exists. It can even block, it has area of effect attacks, and it can create moments where you can deal solid damage. It's actually made so that you can go back and forth with a monster in the most straightforward way if you can just get used to its weight."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Creating a game that's fun to play using the Great Sword's weight makes it easier to create weapons that fight with a quicker tempo,” adds Fujioka. “If high-tempo weapons become the focus, or if we match the speed of the monsters to them, movements will just get quicker and quicker. I think that we're able to create a game that feels like Monster Hunter when you play it by making sure that both sides are properly tuned with a weapon that has the Great Sword's tempo."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Weapons with Personality</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Every hunter has a favorite weapon, with strong feelings about weapon types in general. But at the same time, it's an unavoidable fact that there will always be a most used and most popular weapon along with a 14th-place weapon. Players will make themselves heard if they feel that a weapon is being treated unfairly, and many players will inevitably pick a weapon up if its strengths are easy to understand. There are no right answers when it comes to weapon tuning, which is why these creators aim to bring out their individuality instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka explains, "We always think that it's better to focus on how to design what makes a weapon unique rather than trying to make all weapons equally easy to use. That said, we do think it's a problem if players can't have the gaming experience we want them to have. Of course, it's not a good thing to have a weapon that's both easy to use and overpowered, so there are weapons we've made a lot of changes to for the release version of the game given what we saw in the open beta."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What exactly does he mean by "what makes a weapon unique?” Tokuda explains, using the example of the Hunting Horn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the outset, I told the team that I wanted the concept of this weapon to be that it can produce proper amounts of damage when used where it performs best, the area around you,” he says. “Instead of being able to unleash one attack after the next, you can use something like an Echo Bubble to deal damage by controlling the area. Since we have this element of sound that other weapons can't produce, how do we make use of that while outputting damage? That's the kind of thing we challenged ourselves to do with the weapon. Instead of thinking that it's all about damage, we care more about making the most out of each weapon's personality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now that you're able to carry two weapons in this game, there was some discussion during the open beta about the most powerful choice being to buff yourself with the Hunting Horn before switching to another weapon and fighting. We're tuning the release version, balancing with the end content in mind, to make sure that the Hunting Horn isn't the only choice for a secondary weapon by having self-buffs be worthwhile but not too strong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are always going to be certain weapons that do better or worse against each individual monster. The developers accept that these discrepancies are going to exist, but they want to avoid there being a certain build for a certain weapon that would allow anyone to hunt every monster in the most efficient way possible. Of course, the range of monsters that players target will narrow the further into the endgame they go, and weapon usage will narrow to some degree from an efficiency standpoint. Yet flattening the uniqueness of the game's weapons and monsters would be to erase the roots of Monster Hunter. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka has this to say. "While I think that weapons that stand at the top in terms of time efficiency–ease of use and ease of hunting–are going to see more popularity, we have made it so that if you really care about a weapon type, you'll be able to beat a monster through enough trial and error." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding this, Tokuda brings up the fact that hunters can carry a primary and a secondary weapon in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if you have somewhat specialized weapons, it'd make me happy if players brought two in order for them to complement one another as they play," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Build Your Own Skills</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When thinking about weapon performance, one ultimately begins to wonder about the endgame content that is decorations. The decoration system affects skill builds, so what does it look like in this new title? Tokuda explains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Decorations are currently similar to the system in World, with decorations having specific skill abilities,” he says. “These skills are still activated by placing them into weapon or armor slots (In Wilds, weapon and armor skills can each be activated separately). However, you can make single-skill decorations through something like alchemy. So in [Wilds], players won't have the issue of never being able to get a specific skill."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka nods vigorously from his seat beside Tokuda before speaking about his experience with World. "I never ended up getting it once. My Shield Jewel 2... I ended up finishing the game without having completed my build." (Read more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-surprising-skill-and-weapon-changes-preview">how equipment skills work in Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we are on the subject of builds, I decide to ask the duo about their favorite weapons. Tokuda says he often uses long-range weapons like the Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, and the Sword and Shield which has high adaptability to show monster actions and movements, because as the game's director, he needs to explain what's going on as he plays. He says that he'd like to take plenty of time after the release of Wilds to try out all the weapons now that hunters can carry two. Meanwhile, fans are aware that Fujioka's favorite weapon is the Lance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm a Lance main, or rather, I only use the Lance,” he admits. “I think that the Lance is a weapon where positioning is very important, as you stick to a monster's feet or some other part. Until now, you had to perform this kind of positioning by walking or sidestepping, but in Wilds it's now a lot easier to make minor adjustments, like shifting over slightly as you attack. It's a simple change, but it's important for players to have more choices, so in that sense I think that's one of the positives for Lance users in this game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then again, the Lance is also the weapon that generated the largest reaction during the open beta. While the developers have already announced that major tweaks will be coming to a number of weapons before the official release, we ask Tokuda about the user reaction they received during the beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We received a lot of feedback during the open beta test, and to be honest, one of the largest reactions we got was that the Lance isn't embodying its concept as a weapon,” he says. “Our intention was for players to guard in a variety of ways, sticking to a monster as required and counterattacking. But there were a lot of actions that weren't working properly, such as it being hard to use and perform the right action at the right time, actions going off by mistake, actions coming out late, and so on. Surrounded by so many other actions that worked properly, it ended up feeling like a pretty dull weapon. We're now making major improvements to this for the release version, and we hope you look forward to that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at the time of our interview, the Wilds creators were working tirelessly in order to give hunters the best time they can. They've heard what players had to tell them during the open beta. Both as developers who've made Monster Hunter for many years now and as hunters, they're coming face to face with the 14 weapon types to build the greatest gaming experience. Monster Hunter continues to be an unmatched action game series because of the support it receives from both the players' passion and the developers’ tireless spirit of inquiry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see for yourself just how much the Monster Hunter Wilds developers take feedback from passionate players into account in their official detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update video</a>, where Tokuda covers performance enhancements, detailed weapon changes, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shuka Yamada is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <p>
EA has lowered its financial forecast for its current fiscal year, pointing to the 'underperformance' of EA Sports FC 2025 - which it says accounts for the "majority" of the shortfall - alongside lower-than-expected interest in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
As noted in EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">revised outlook</a> for the year ending 31st March 2025, the company was previously forecasting a  "mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings". However, it now expects a "mid-single-digit decline", blaming the "majority of the change" on EA Sports 2025 - which saw a "slowdown in momentum" following its release in September.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA has reported lower-than-expected interest in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, saying BioWare's fantasy RPG "engaged" approximately 1.5m players during the quarter - a number it describes as being "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations."

<p>
All this means the publisher now anticipates net bookings of approximately $2.21 billion for its third fiscal quarter and an updated range of $7-7.15 billion for fiscal year 2025.
</p>
<p>
"During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio, EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a statement accompanying today's revised guidance. "However, Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> underperformed our net bookings expectations." Even so, Wilson says, "We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline."
</p><p>
Despite Dragon Age: The Veilguard failing to meet EA's business expectations, BioWare's latest was well-received by critics when it launched in October 2024. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">wrote in his five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was less enthused by EA Sports FC 2025, however.

<p>EA has announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company’s internal expectations. In its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary Q3 FY2025 earnings report</a>, EA revealed that it was forced to lower its revenue forecast for both the quarter and fiscal year after the first Dragon Age game in 10 years missed expectations by a wide margin. </p>



<p>“Dragon Age engaged approximately 1.5 million players during the quarter, down nearly 50% from the company’s expectations,” the company said. </p>



<p>Because of the lower player engagement of Dragon Age: The Veilguard—as well as EA Sports FC 25—EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the year to be between $7-$7.15 billion compared to the originally expected $7.5-$7.8 billion. For the quarter itself, EA has adjusted its expectations to $2.21 billion in net bookings.</p>







<p><strong>“</strong>During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a prepared statement. “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline.”</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was released on October 31, 2024 to generally favorable reviews from critics. The game’s director, Corine Busche, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently left BioWare</a> after 18 years with the company for a new opportunity.</p>



<p>EA will present its full earnings on February 4 at 5pm ET/2pm PT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the call when it takes place. </p>

                <p>Several popular gaming-related subreddits are banning posts that link to social media site X (formerly Twitter). Among those issuing the ban are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1i7f9br/rsteamdeck_will_no_longer_allow_links_to_x/?share_id=iV0qYi-9g5id_e-aHsrW9&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/SteamDeck</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1i7ideu/x_twitter_links_are_banned_from_rmonsterhunter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/MonsterHunter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1i7ivkr/posts_linking_to_twitterx_are_now_banned_in_rwow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/WOW</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/PCGaming,</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1i73hne/rnintendo_joins_other_subreddits_in_banning_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Nintendo</a>.</p><p>These bans are part of a larger movement on Reddit to ban X content. Since the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/2025/01/22/x-ban-spreads-across-reddit-as-communities-react-to-musks-gesture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">influx of blacklisting</a> began, there have been a number of posts made across various subreddits raising the question of if the respective subreddit should follow suit. Currently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1i6y5cw/should_rhalo_ban_or_restrict_xtwitter_posts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1i7d4mj/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/RPG</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/1i6ozcd/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Valorant</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1i7c49p/proposal_to_ban_x_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/AnimalCrossing</a>, and several other prominent subreddits are in discussions, with the majority of subscribers currently in favor of a prohibiting content pulled from X. The extent of the bans vary from subreddit to subreddit, with r/Nintendo and r/SteamDeck allowing screenshots while r/WOW is prohibiting images as well.</p><p>The official reasons for the ban vary, though many cite Elon Musk's recent actions as the primary motivation. Musk, who owns X, recently attended President Trump's inauguration and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was seen doing a Nazi-like salute</a>. However, different forums have also cited X's lack of moderation and "increasingly hateful" content as reason to blacklist the website.</p><p>"This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now," r/PCGaming moderator Shock4ndAwe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently."</p><p>r/WOW, a World of Warcraft forum boasting over 3 million members, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1i6mjqc/rmagictcg_and_the_website_formerly_known_as/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> that a combination of "recent political events" and X's declining reliability as a news source contributed to its decision. r/MagicTCG, a subreddit dedicated to Magic the Gathering, confirmed that its users were "overwhelmingly in favor" of a ban due to "Nazi behavior from the owner."</p><p>Though some news outlets and citizens continue to debate if Musk's gesture was a Nazi salute, German and Jewish communities alike have expressed their belief that the gesture was antisemitic. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, condemned Musk, stating that while "everyone can say what he wants, even if he is a billionaire, what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship-pandemic-middle-earth-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> board game is coming to store shelves. Z-Man Games, the studio known for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-legacy-season-0-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is using their beloved game system as a foundation for <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>, a take on Tolkien's iconic world.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, Z-Man Games provides an overview of <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>. It is, as expected, an adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy where players must work together to destroy The One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship-frodo-and-sam-game-pieces.jpg?itok=kOIq72Ml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship-frodo-and-sam-game-pieces.jpg?itok=_xTtjJN2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like other <em>Pandemic</em> games, <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> will be played on a giant map of Middle-earth. Each player starts controlling two characters in their canon locations. Frodo starts in The Shire, Arwen starts in Rivendell, etc..From there, players can move characters to different places and join friendly characters and troops to form their fellowship.</p>

<p>Once the players finish their turn, shadow troops will deploy from Mordor and spread out, attempting to capture safe-havens. In addition, Sauron commands the Nazgul to stop Frodo from reaching Mount Doom. For the players to succeed, they will need to use stealth, resistance, friendship, and valor to overcome these dangerous challenges.</p>

<p>Like other <em>Pandemic</em> games, <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is replayable. The game includes 24 objective cards, each one based on iconic moments from the books, Each time you play, you can choose a different subset of cards, leading to other scenarios. Of course, there is the straightforward, but challenging scenario fans are familiar with.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship-sauron-tower.jpg?itok=b3AR3mNU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-fellowship-sauron-tower.jpg?itok=clLtSgNx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those curious about how the game plays, the starting scenario is available to play for free on Board Game Arena for a limited time.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Z-Man Games has adapted a beloved fantasy property with their <em>Pandemic</em> system. The studio also adapted the iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wrath-of-lich-king-board-game-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em></a> to gaming tables back in 2021. It even dipped into space fantasy with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-clone-wars-pandemic-game-coming-to-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></a> adaptation in 2022.</p>

<p><em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is available for pre-order right now. There is no official release date, but early adopters will receive a promotional Gandalf The White meeple and character card at no additional cost.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is getting five new maps in Season 2. The first details for those maps were confirmed via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-2-trailer-gives-more-details-on-maps-modes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 launch trailer</a>, but, now, Activision has released full details on the new multiplayer maps coming to the game. </p>



<p>The five new maps are Bounty, Lifeline, Dealership, Grind, and Bullet. Three maps—Bounty, Lifeline, and Dealership—will be available at launch on January 28 while the other two will come mid-season. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-two-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Details of each map</a> can be found below via Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-2-multiplayer-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Multiplayer Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Bounty</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Bounty is a new 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a penthouse at the top of an Avalon skyscraper. </p>



<p>“From the starting point of a pristine Patio, move inside an opulent, gold-plated Nightclub and Lounge where top-shelf entertaining was provided to a variety of rich guests,” the map’s description reads. “Ambush enemies by jumping over the light fixtures hanging over the Lobby below.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Lifeline</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It may seem similar to Black Ops 2’s Hijacked map, but Lifeline appears to be much smaller an more chaotic. A new small-sized map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6, Lifeline sees you fight on a high-end yacht that’s burning in the middle of the sea.</p>



<p>“From Bow to Aft, it won’t take long to collide in the center Bar and gambling den, the disco room, or along the steps on Portside and Starboard,” says Activision. “Keep your head on a swivel or risk getting thrown overboard.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Dealership</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last of the three Season 2 launch maps, Dealership is another medium-sized 6v6 map that takes place around the Pallasar car dealership. And while it looks like a dealership on the outside, it’s actually a front for a black market where cars are traded for weapons.</p>



<p>“Battle around the wreckage in the Car Lot and Showroom, pushing the fight into the interior Commissary and Lounge or out on the Courtyard and once offered an idyllic vista,” it’s description reads. “Open the sliding doors to either side of the Garage for a quick ambush or close them to stall incoming enemies.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Grind</strong> <strong>(mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A remaster of the classic map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Grind is a 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a skatepark. In addition to the outdoor skatepark, there is a pro shop and indoor stadium to fight your opponents in.</p>



<p>“Use the ramps for cover and to get above the competition and bust out your best tricks like the 360-corkscrew one-shot. Also expect an additional surprise related to this map, later in the season,” Activision said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Bullet (mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, Bullet is another small map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6 multiplayer matches. The map takes players aboard a bullet train where you can go between train cars with little room to hide. If inside gets too tight, players can head to the roof of the train to fight.</p>



<p>“Race through the automatic sliding doors separating each car, from the first-class lounge through the dining car, second-class seats, and up to the cab where the fallen conductor dispels any hope of reaching the destination in one piece,” Activision writes.</p>

The Titanium Core skin is ripped straight out of the movie, featuring the machine’s iconic, cold facial features and glowing red eyes. The T-800 skin, meanwhile, aims to bring Schwarzenegger's appearance to the battlefield, though it doesn’t exactly look like the younger version of the action star it’s based on. Still, it’s no doubt a fun callback to a classic series that also comes with four Weapon Blueprints, a special finishing movie, the “Tracking…Tracking…” emote, “What Pain?” emblem, and “Lookin’ Fly” calling card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Terminator Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 crossover content doesn’t stop there. From February 6 to February 20, Warzone, Multiplayer, and Zombies players will enjoy The Terminator event, which sees players collecting skulls to unlock up to 13 rewards. This is in addition to two other events – Shadow Hunt and St. Patrick’s Day: Clover Craze – which will add even more unlockable upgrades in February and March, respectively.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-preview-an-rts-that-takes-me-back-to-the-90s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as I fired up the Tempest Rising demo for the first time, I had a good feeling. Watching the opening cinematic, which set the tone with cheesy dialogue from bulky armored soldiers and a reedy scientist, I couldn’t help but smile. The music, UI design, and units seem tailor-made to take me back to high school, when I’d stay up late playing Command &amp; Conquer with my friends, hopped up on Mountain Dew, taco-flavored Pringles, and sleep deprivation. Recapturing the feeling through a new game in the modern era is a blast, and I’m excited to see what else the developers at Slipgate Ironworks have in store at launch and beyond. Whether I was jumping into Skirmish to play against bots with clever AI, or Ranked Multiplayer, playing Tempest Rising feels as comfortable as putting on my well-worn baseball glove.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My initial reaction is no accident, either. The developers told me they <em>set out</em> to create a nostalgic real-time strategy (RTS) game that evoked the classics of the 90s and 2000s, with quality-of-life improvements expected of modern games. Set in 1997, Tempest Rising takes place in an alternate history in which the Cuban Missile Crisis exploded into World War 3. In the wake of widespread nuclear bombardment, strange flowering vines started to grow. These plants contain vast amounts of electrical energy, ushering in a new era of power for those prepared to withstand the fallout to harvest them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the build I played was focused exclusively on multiplayer, I’ll have to wait to see what story mode will bring, but it will feature two replayable 11-mission campaigns, one for each of the main factions available in the preview. The Tempest Dynasty (TD) is an alliance of Eastern European and Asian countries who were the most devastated by WW3. The Global Defense Forces (GDF) on the other hand, are an alliance between the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. There is a third faction, but we’ll have to wait to learn more until the campaign is available, as they aren’t playable in the preview build, the Steam RTS Fest demo, or at launch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the two factions, the Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste. The Dynasty also has access to something called ‘plans,’ which are used to activate faction-wide bonuses of three specific kinds. Your Construction Yard, the main building everyone starts with, can activate one plan at a time. All you need is a little extra power generation and, apart from the 30 second cooldown for switching plans, you’re good to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Logistics Plan let me build new structures faster and harvest resources more quickly. Mobile resource harvesters move more quickly, too. The Martial Plan boosted the attack speed of my units and gave them resistance to rockets and other explosives, as well as giving Machinist units the ability to drain their own health to gain 50% additional attack speed. Finally, the Security Plan cut the cost of making units and buildings, improved the Repair function certain units have, and expanded Radar vision. I found a fun rhythm by alternating between economy-boosting phases where I would gather more resources with the Logistics Plan, then sped-up building phases under the Security Plan, and finally going on the offensive with the enhanced combat potential of the Martial Plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of flexibility extends to other aspects of the Dynasty, as well. Instead of having to establish a base with a Refinery to harvest nearby fields of tempest (like the GDF does), the Tempest Dynasty builds Tempest Rigs, vehicles which drive to a resource-rich area and harvest until the field is depleted, then are free to pack up and go somewhere else. Because of this, my favorite ‘fast expand’ RTS strategy is easier than ever, particularly because it doesn’t matter how far away from my base these self-contained units go. In fact, sending a few Tempest Rigs to faraway places was a great way to let them harvest in peace, generating reliable cash for me without being discovered by my opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynasty also has a fun unit called the Salvage Van, which repairs nearby vehicles. It can, however, also be converted into Salvage Mode, which destroys nearby vehicles no matter who they belong to, giving resources back to the salvaging player. I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, power plants created by the Dynasty can switch from power generation to ‘Distribution Mode’ which speeds up the construction and attack speed of nearby buildings (yeah, some upgraded Tempest Dynasty buildings have cannons. It’s awesome), at the cost of taking damage while the mode is active. Thankfully, the mode will stop affecting buildings at critical health, so I didn’t need to worry about destroying my own base for the speed boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While I prefer the Tempest Dynasty, the GDF certainly has its allure, too. They focus more on buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and exercising control over the battlefield. My favorite synergy between GDF units revolves around the Marking mechanic. Certain vehicles and infantry can ‘mark’ the enemies they target. Marked enemies drop Intel when defeated (a currency used for creating advanced units and structures), but if you invest in certain Doctrine upgrades (Tempest Rising’s version of ‘tech trees’), Marked enemies will get various debuffs including dealing less damage, taking more damage, and even increasing the range of certain units who attack them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction has three tech trees to explore, which is where you’ll decide which part of your faction you’ll lean into. Like the GDF ‘Marking &amp; Intel’ tree, the Dynasty has a tree which boosts the effectiveness of their ‘Plans,’ and that’s just the start. In addition to fun tech trees,there are cooldown abilities enabled by constructing specific advanced buildings. They cost money to activate, and each has its own cooldown, but these abilities are powerful ways to swing the tide of battle while adding flavor to the type of strategy each faction excels at. While both factions have abilities which deal damage in an area, or spawn extra troops, the GDF can also create spy drones, spawn beacons to allow building in remote locations, and even stop enemy vehicles from being able to attack for 12 seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Dynasty has fewer buildings, with each basic building capable of being upgraded into the advanced version, losing a structure to an enemy Engineer can be rough. To counter that, the Dynasty has a special ability called Lockdown, which prevents enemy takeovers, but simultaneously stops the building from taking action. The Field Infirmary was the ability I got the most use out of, which let me drop a stationary troop-healing area anywhere on the map. This ability is a great compliment to the Dynasty, which already has both special infantry units and vehicles to repair mechanized allies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is more to dig into, and I can’t wait to do it, particularly because the launch version will let me jump into Custom Lobbies with friends, letting us team up against the very clever AI bots (which used impressive hit-and-run and harrying tactics on me during Skirmishes). Until then, I’ll have to settle for fighting alone, squishing my bot enemies with swarms of death balls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Barnett writes reviews, features, &amp; more for</em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/Ribnax"><em> </em><u><em>IGN</em></u></a><em>, GameSpot, &amp; Kotaku.

            <p>
Two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a "really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">shortly after The Witcher 4's reveal</a> last year, CD Projekt called Ciri's promotion to lead "really exciting" in terms of the opportunities it opened up, "by just virtue of who she is [and] what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well." And it turns out that's a sentiment Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle shares.
</p>
<p>
"I'm really excited," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says">recently revealed to IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the Saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons. But mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."

<p>
Of course, Cockle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">now confirmed to be returning as Geralt</a> in The Witcher 4, despite the character's demotion - although it's not currently clear how substantial a role he'll play. The actor had already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">let slip he'd be "part of" the new game</a> last August- earning himself a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doug-cockle-got-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-saying-geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-but-not-as-the-main-character">bit of a slap on the wrist</a> from CD Projekt - and it was finally made official when Geralt popped up at the end of December's reveal trailer to utter a gravelly, "See you on the path".
</p><p>
Unfortunately for impatient sorts, The Witcher 4 is likely still some considerable way off (CD Projekt's hasn't even announced a release year yet), but fans can, at least, get a fresh Cockle fix much sooner. The actor is reprising the role of Geralt of Rivia in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-doug-cockle-starring-animated-witcher-movie-sirens-of-the-deep-gets-february-arrival-date">upcoming animated movie The Witcher: Sirens of The Deep</a>, which joins the streaming service on 11th February.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-in-progress.1089210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time I lost my mech in Synduality Echo of Ada was on my second sortie, and lot of things went wrong. I didn’t buy insurance beforehand and I took way too much stuff out with me because I hit the wrong button, and then I chose not to take a moment to repair right before I got into the encounter that killed me. I made a series of avoidable mistakes followed by a bad decision, and this mech-flavored extraction shooter made sure I lost everything I had for it – so it’s a good sign that, after I was done cursing Synduality and then myself, I was immediately excited to try and get it all back. I have much more to do and see before I am ready for a final review, but that trial by fire will certainly stick with me until the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Synduality has a pretty cool premise: In the far future, humanity has been nearly wiped out by a mysterious blue rain called the Tears of the New Moon. In addition to killing humans on contact, the blue rain also made animals and plants gigantic and aggressive. To survive, society has moved underground and adopted the use of enormous mechs called Cradlecoffins to explore the surface world and gather energy-producing AO Crystals to survive. You step into the role of a nameless, faceless Drifter — someone who pilots a Cradlecoffin. Your goal? Get up there, get the things you need to upgrade your base and make some cash, and get out before the locals turn your Cradlecoffin into a grave.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Synduality Echo of Ada Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cradlecoffins aren’t your traditional mechs. They’re slower than something you’d find in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review"><u>Armored Core</u></a> – though similarly armed, as they’re still bipedal and wield weapons – but faster than the behemoths you’d see in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mechwarrior-5-clans-review"><u>MechWarrior</u></a>. Ready for a deep cut? They’re actually a lot like the mechs from 2002’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/04/phantom-crash-review"><u>Phantom Crash</u></a>, which is to say they are a nice balance of being reasonably fast but still heavy and limited in terms of, shall we say, vertical mobility. Armored Core mechs can dunk like Jordan. Cradlecoffins got no ups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you’re not alone. In addition to your mech, you’ve got a Magus — think a humanoid AI you can fully customize and play dress up with — helping to guide you when you’re out on the surface by marking objectives on your map, alerting you to threats, and even keeping track of the weather. You can be as normal or as strangely intimate as you want about the creation process, though it kinda seems as if Synduality assumes you’re more likely to pick a robo-girlfriend than a robo-boyfriend based on the clothing choices available. (Even the AI-controlled Cradelcoffins have robo-girlfriends.) There are several different personalities to choose from, including supportive mentor lady, demure, eager-to-please girl; encouraging big brother, and spicy athlete who just wants you to be the best version of yourself. They’re a weirdly likeable little crew — I chuckled when my spicy athlete robo-girlfriend essentially told me to stop whining and eat my veggies (read: weeds that we had removed from the base) or she’d beat me up. And since they’re the only companion you’ll have for most of your time with Synduality, their presence is welcome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the other players I've seen aren’t out there to kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to their clothes and look, you can also customize the special abilities and focus of your Magus, whether that’s finding AO Crystals, providing more info about different Enders (the name for that superpowered flora and fauna I talked about earlier), or giving you the low-down on the other Cradlecoffins you’ll run into once you pop out on the surface. So far I’ve liked both the one that’s good at protecting me from the evil rain and the one who has a knack for spotting other Cradlecoffins at range because hearing another engine in this game is <em>stressful</em>, but I appreciate that you can tailor your Magus to assist you be the best Drifter you wanna be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll run into other players in Synduality’s world, but in my experience, most of them aren’t out there to kill you and take your things. Usually, an encounter with another player means the two of you being very cagey, aiming your guns at each other, until one of you finally uses the wave emote. Then the other returns it and you both go on your way. It’s admittedly tense, and an extraction shooter like this should be, because you’re never more than a single insurance-less run away from losing all your things. The whole “we’re all working together to help humanity” thing sets up that cautious camaraderie, but there is always the danger that someone’s gonna see your shiny shotgun and think “I want that and I don’t wanna work for it,” so… you know. This does seem (so far) like a kinder, gentler extraction shooter, but you should still be careful around other people, even if they do the wave emote.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing each mission means making a lot of interesting choices. How far from the elevators that bring you to and from the safety of the underground are you willing to venture? What kind of materials are you looking to collect for your base, and how much are you going to risk to get them? How much ammo will you head out with? What kind of mech? Will you prioritize carrying capacity or defense? All of these choices matter, and you may regret your words and deeds when you’re sitting at low health with no repair kits, far away from an elevator in a world where everything wants to kill you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far Synduality has mostly just been this loop played over and over again, but it’s at least an amusing one, with a little bit of fun base building and dress-up in-between that I haven’t had a chance to dig too deeply into yet. What’s less amusing are the microtransactions and battle pass (we live in hell!) that can speed up the process of getting a better Cradlecoffin substantially despite this not being a free-to-play game. You get almost nothing in the free track of that pass, which is a standard-issue problem to some degree, but I’ll need to play more to see how much these systems feel like they impact the overall pace of progression without spending any money. I don’t think I would have all the nice things I have now, which replaced the stuff I lost, if I didn’t have that battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am at least enjoying Synduality for now, though I have yet to unlock the single-player missions or the second map. Once I put some time into those, expand my base, and just generally Do More Stuff, I’ll have a better idea of where Synduality falls. Until then, I’ll be out in the world, trying not to die too much. Buy insurance, kids. It’s a scam, but it may save your life – or, at least, your mech.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first thing you'll want to double check is whether there are any typos or spelling mistakes. Roblox codes have to be entered exactly as the developers intended, and can even be case sensitive. Make sure there aren't any spelling errors, and that the lower and upper case letters are all in the correct place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything has been typed in correctly then that means the code is, unfortunately, expired. Roblox codes typically only last for a short amount of time, so if you see a code you like, you need to act quick and redeem it while it's still active.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Guardians Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">New Anime Guardians codes are shared by the experience's creator, Zero Developer Studio, on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MdXq9qZG3k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's official Discord server</a>. We update this page regularly, but if you want to get codes as soon as possible, it's best to join the Anime Guardians Discord server where you'll see codes posted in real-time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Guardians In Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Guardians is a Roblox tower defense game that should appeal to fans of experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-world-tower-defense-codes">Anime World Tower Defense</a>. The aim of the game is to defend your base from wave after wave of enemy forces. To protect your base, you'll have to place auto-battling characters, known as units, on a map in the best positions possible so they can strategically defeat the opposition quickly and efficiently. On the battlefield units can be upgraded so you can easily take on tougher enemies, while during your downtime you can also add new characters to your anime-inspired army via the game's gacha-style summoning system. Characters in Anime Guardians are inspired by a range of beloved shows including Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen and Re: Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The first teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> confirmed what fans had long suspected by depicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri as the game's new lead character</a>. Through the first three games, voice actor Doug Cockle portrayed the previous main character, Geralt of Rivia, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">he will reprise his role in the sequel</a> as well. But Cockle is far from disappointed about taking a backseat this time, and he's eager to see Ciri get the spotlight.</p><p>"I'm really excited," Cockle told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because... I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."</p><p>Cockle also related that CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">gently admonished him</a> for sharing his theories about Geralt's presence in the game.</p><p>"I was never really out of their good books," said Cockle. "All developers are like this. They want to keep their surprises and I actually didn't know anything, so I was just making guesses at things and stuff like that. And probably one of their requests was to just to stop guessing, 'Doug, you might be right. You might not be right. It doesn't matter if you are talking me. Doug, who plays Geralt, whatever you say is going to be taken as something.' So it was a very, very light slap on the wrist. It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p>Cockle is reprising his role as Geralt in Netflix's upcoming animated film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-faces-a-war-between-the-land-and-the-sea-in-the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep/1100-6528810/" data-ref-id="1100-6528810">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>. That will premiere on Netflix on February 11, while The Witcher Season 4 is expected to arrive later this year. As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">ramped up production</a> at the end of 2024, and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/age-of-pirates-captain-blood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Development on Captain Blood</a> reportedly began as far back as 2003, as Russian developer Akella planned to make a game based on a novel by author Rafael Sabatini. A game titled Captain Blood was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/22/1c-announces-e3-line-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased at E3 2004</a>, but it switched teams and restarted development multiple times before the project settled with publisher 1C Company around 2008. GameSpot even went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-blood-hands-on/1100-6192241/" data-ref-id="1100-6192241">hands-on with Captain Blood</a> around this time, already lamenting that it had "been in development for several years now." While a release was supposed to happen by 2010, it kept getting delayed and ended up never releasing due to parties involved with the game going bankrupt and other legal challenges surrounding the game.</p><p>All of that meant Captain Blood was left stuck in development hell after 2010...until now. In 2024, video game publisher SNEG Ltd. acquired the rights to Captain Blood and began working on an offical release. After one last small delay from late 2024 to 2025, we finally have a concrete release date for this action-adventure game. While we have no idea whether or not the game itself is any good, it's impressive that a game that seemed cursed to never release is finally coming out.</p><p>Captain Blood launches for PC, Steam, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 6, priced at $25.</p>

The card game features many famous and obscure Disney characters from movies like <em>Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Snow White</em>, and more. I’ve been playing since last year and have had a great time with it. But I also know that getting into <em>Lorcana </em>can seem overwhelming and confusing at first. </p><p>However, there’s actually a really simple, cheap, and easy way to get into Disney’s hit card game. All you need to do is buy the <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway kit. That’s it. </p><h2 id="h855796"><a id=""></a>Buy A <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway Kit!</h2><p>No, seriously, if you and a friend, spouse, or sibling want to start learning and playing <em>Lorcana</em>, just buy the Gateway kit. That’s all you need! This starter kit contains two decks, four booster packs, a playing mat, damage tokens, a handy rule book, and a guide that walks both players through learning <em>Lorcana</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">While the retail price of this kit is $25</a></span> or more, its regularly marked down for half that or less at places like Walmart and Best Buy.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"> I found a copy at Target recently for $12 and that deal is available online</a></span> as of this writing. At that price, the Gateway kit is one of the best deals in card games. </p><p>Just make sure you buy a Gateway kit specifically, and not a Treasure Trove or Starter Deck box. These can sometimes cost around the same price and offer some of what’s found in the Gateway box, but they aren’t the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lorcana</em> Gateway kit’s cover has Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Maleficent, and Stitch on the front and features a big gold sticker that says “Learn to Play!” It also says “Gateway” on the bottom of the front of the box. That’s the one you want to buy! </p><p>I’ve played a lot of card games, both physical and digital, and learning them can be a hassle. And my wife has far less experience with card games than I do. But in just a few hours, we were both playing the game without looking up rules or making mistakes. And more importantly, we were having fun.</p><h2 id="h855797"><a id=""></a>The Gateway kit is the perfect way to learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>The key is that <em>Lorcana’s </em>Gateway Kit isn’t just a bunch of cards, but instead a fully developed system that slowly builds up each player’s deck and options over time. </p><p>You start with just 30 cards each containing simple, basic characters. You then play a few matches and work together to complete challenges laid out in the guidebook. These tasks are usually simple, but make you engage with the game’s mechanics. So you might have to both play five high-cost cards, or challenge and defeat seven characters, things like that. </p><p>Once you’ve completed all the challenges and feel comfortable with the rules and cards so far, you unlock new cards via reward pack boosters. In here you’ll find specific new cards that add a few more rules and options to your deck. Then you complete more challenges and repeat until you’ve unlocked all the rewards. At that point, you’ll each have a full <em>Lorcana </em>deck of over 60 cards and you’ll completely understand how the game works.</p><p>This is the best way to learn a card game in my opinion. It’s fun, cooperative, and super effective. And you can reset the Gateway kit using a guide found inside and teach other players using the same box. Nifty! </p><h2 id="h855798"><a id=""></a>What to do after you learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>Okay, so after learning how to play <em>Lorcana </em>using the Gateway kit, you might want to keep playing and collect more cards. Now what? Personally, I recommend picking up a few starter decks. These contain 60 cards and a booster pack and let you quickly get your hands on a pre-built deck with some solid synergy options. </p><p>You can also start buying boosters online or in card shops. I’d avoid some retailers that sell them at full price (or more!) and instead look for places selling these 12-card packs at a discount.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you do start to buy booster packs and starter decks, you might also want to invest in a few deck boxes, some card sleeves, and something to hold your excess cards in when they aren’t in a deck. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">There are official <em>Lorcana</em>-branded products</a></span> if you want to go that route, but these tend to be a bit pricey.

<p>It probably happens to you all the time. You’re sitting there immersed in a new video game, and then a new character is introduced, and you swear that their voice actor sounds familiar. You spend time looking up everything they’ve done, scrolling through the list in hopes you find something you recognize. We’ll make life a little easier with the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth voice cast!</p>



<h2 id="h-main-voice-cast-for-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">Main Voice Cast for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2>



<p>The cast of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is quite large and varied, with a slew of main characters, supporting characters, and more than a few side characters you’ll interact with occasionally but not frequently. They’re all mostly memorable in some way, thanks in no small part to their highly talented voice actors!</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Cody Christain, who plays Cloud Strife, also played the main character in <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong>. But outside of the long-running RPG series, he has roles in:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Assassination Nation – Johnny</strong></li>



<li><strong>Teen Wolf – Theo Raeken</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pretty Little Liars – Mike Montgomery</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grey’s Anatomy – Brad</strong></li>

<h2 id="h-what-other-else-is-sephiroth-s-voice-actor-in">What Other Else is Sephiroth’s Voice Actor In?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Teen Wolf – Derek Hale</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supergirl – Superman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Superman &amp; Lous – Superman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Road to Perdition – Michael Sullivan Jr.</strong></li>

                <p>Thus far, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest gaming story of 2025, and there's barely been any definitive word on the subject aside from the announcement video earlier this month. Nintendo hasn't even disclosed any upcoming games besides <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">an apparent Mario Kart sequel</a>. Now, online retailer Newegg has kicked off another round of speculation by listing new Mario and Zelda games coming this year as well.</p><p>Newegg is selling <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop gift cards</a>, which includes a brief list of some of Nintendo's upcoming titles. Some of the games--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-trailer-shows-off-the-remasters-switch-glow-up/1100-6528711/" data-ref-id="1100-6528711">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>--were already confirmed and announced. However, putting titles down like "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, [and] a Legend of Zelda remake/remaster" is going to attract attention.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't confirmed that a new Mario game or a Zelda remake/remaster are on the way, and it's likely their inclusion here was either a mistake or guesswork. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review/1900-6416795/" data-ref-id="1900-6416795">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was one of the first big games on Switch, and it seems very probable that Nintendo will have the next AAA Mario game for Switch 2. It also stands to reason that another Legend of Zelda won't be far behind. Whether either or both projects are real and ready to arrive this year remains to be seen.</p><p>Although more information about Switch 2 will be revealed at the Nintendo Direct on April 2, the company has shared a new video that reveals <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-video-reveals-how-snappy-joy-con-removal-works/1100-6528933/" data-ref-id="1100-6528933">how the snappy Joy-Con removal works</a>. Meanwhile, a Switch developer has offered his breakdown of the Switch 2 reveal to explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-significantly-more-powerful-according-to-a-game-dev/1100-6528921/" data-ref-id="1100-6528921">the sheer power of the new system</a>. Nintendo hasn't revealed a more specific release date than 2025 for Switch 2 yet, but some are predicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">a June launch</a>.</p>
