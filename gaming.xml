            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-early-access-review-in-progress.1139637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of fine details that go into making a life simulator fun but also reflective of the real world. You have to balance customizability and creative freedom with just enough rules to make choices feel realistic and challenging, and then invisibly weave those decisions together in a satisfying way. (It turns out recreating life is hard – sorry for all the flak, Dr. Frankenstein.) Yet, despite the difficulties, it’s a task developer Krafton has taken a respectable stab at with inZOI based on what I’ve played of its Early Access launch version so far. Its beautiful, realistic aesthetic makes a striking first impression, and the ambitious simulator systems underneath initially result in some impressive harmony. However, as I continue to spend more time within this simulation, the seams of inZOI’s universe are starting to show, leaving the world more empty than you might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Addressing the elephant in the room first, it’s impossible not to immediately compare inZOI to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-4-review-2024"><u>The Sims</u></a>, a series it’s very clearly both taking inspiration from and attempting to compete with. You play as an omnipotent figure who can create and control little citizens as they live their best, or more often worse, lives. You can build up a house from scratch, manipulate the features of each person (who are called Zoi), and embroil them in all the local drama you can find. They can have jobs, go to school, and explore the local area with as much or as little free will as you allow. These surface-level similarities quickly run thin, though, once you start digging into Krafton’s unique take on this genre. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">inZOI Gameplay Screenshots (Early Access)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you start a new game in inZOI, you must first build a household using the detailed Character Creator Studio. Alongside choosing their name, gender, and age, you can select a Trait that defines your avatar’s personality. There are 18 to choose from, ranging from Authoritarian to Individualist, with each option providing a handy Characteristics sidebar describing how this choice will affect how they operate in-game. As a hardworking freelancer, I opted for the Go-Getter trait, which values professional activities and, in an endearing twist, also holds onto nervousness for longer than other Zois. As you press on into the ebb and flow of virtual life, your Zoi will develop their ego further as they encounter likes and dislikes, such as fast food and fitness, that meddle with their mood. inZOI neatly wraps up personality archetypes into simple grab-and-go options, which, while convenient, can feel a bit limiting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where looks are concerned, you can pick from a sizeable list of presets or take a more fine-tooth comb approach, tugging at the specific anchor points on your Zoi’s body and face – I opted for a combination of both, finding my closest match and generously moulding them in my image. There's a selection of preset colours alongside a granular colour picker for many options too, allowing more nuance in your choices. Courtesy of inZOI’s realistic visual style, my Zoi quickly resembled a real person, and I enjoyed the process of coordinating their make-up and hair with my own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s inZOI’s fashion sensibilities that really make it stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The system for adjusting facial features is a thoroughly engrossing time-sink, but it’s inZOI’s fashion sensibilities that really make it stand out. During the creation process, you need to curate nine different outfits, including formalwear, sleepwear, and weather-appropriate attire for summer and winter. There’s a decent mix of modern trends, like cargo-style parachute pants, alongside tailored classics like military and leather jackets. Basics like t-shirts also come in multiple lengths, and you can mix and match and layer to your heart's content. Safe to say, I spent even longer here, curating a Y2K-inspired outfit complete with leg warmers, Doc Marten dupes, and an adorable oversized baseball jersey. It’s not a totally flawless system, with the baggier silhouetted clothing options clipping against the Zois in strange ways. Still, this felt like one of the more polished aspects of inZOI, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing dress-up with my creations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once your family is organised, the next step is finding them a home. Currently, inZOI boasts two locations: the Korean-inspired city of Dowon, and the Californian Bliss Bay. You can build your own house or move into a predesigned lot, with each township featuring a small selection of public plots like shops, cafes, and open spaces like parks or shrines. Unfortunately, it’s here that I first noticed the seams of Krafton’s ambitious project starting to show. Illuminated neon signs coat the streets of Dowon with a dreamy multicolour glow, while in Bliss Bay, the setting sun imbues the beach with a soothing coastal atmosphere. Sit too long, though, and it all starts to feel a bit hollow. Those neon signs sit atop empty buildings, and the gentle sunlight reflects off static bits of set dressing. It’s clear a lot of care has been taken to give the <em>impression </em>of a bustling environment, and I admired those details – particularly the faux McDonalds, which garnered a giggle from me – but I couldn’t shake the feeling that much of the world is mostly a facade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That nagging sensation continued into my Zoi’s daily life, where I could manage their needs like hunger and hygiene but not really make headway on how they fit into the digital culture. Despite choosing the Go-Getter trait, I didn’t get the impression it was making too much of a tangible difference in my day-to-day activities, especially when my other Zoi was acting essentially the same despite the fact I’d given them an oppositional personality style. I ran into the same blockades when I started a family in a separate household, with many conversations repeating on a loop no matter who I was controlling. Topics like Cryptocurrency and the power of humility kept showing up in my dialogue tree. It was admittedly funny the first few times, but gradually, that repetition made progressing relationships a tad monotonous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s delightful that the things like your Zoi’s treadmill display seems functional, or that the detail of  their food is so convincing that my stomach often rumbled in unison with my avatar’s as they tucked into their lunch. However, these pockets of well-designed actions can make the simplistic or repetitive alternatives feel cold by comparison. Over time, it was as if my Zoi was less of an individual and more of a semi-controllable drone, performing tasks without rhyme or reason. Perhaps the options will diversify once they fill out their likes and dislikes and make more friends, though I certainly didn’t notice any differences across the roughly 15 hours I’ve played so far. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>inZOI is an Early Access game, and as of right now, it certainly feels like one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, a salve to this weirdness is inZOI’s Karma system, which punishes or rewards citizens based on their actions. When interacting with other Zois or objects, you’re occasionally presented with a choice accompanied by a yin and yang symbol, letting you know that performing that action will affect their Karmic score. Stealing coins from a parking meter is considered bad, whereas giving directions to a random person is considered good. While I was initially sceptical, I soon came to feel the system’s wrath. I sent my Zoi on an unwarranted tirade, hulking out at the local park and kicking a vending machine before attempting to win a stuffed turkey toy at a claw machine. After a shocking number of attempts, the toy remained trapped in its plexiglass prison. From here, I directed my Zoi to become a model citizen, complimenting strangers and telling gregarious jokes before returning to the same machine. Wouldn’t you believe it, they won a prize on their first attempt this time. Karma is a simple concept that works well in practice and offers a pleasant invisible boundary to rub against – I only wish more actions would impact the score. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is still much more to do and see before I reach a final verdict, like diving into its careers, cars, and the nitty-gritty of the build mode, and that’s just to start. inZOI is an Early Access game, and as of right now, it certainly feels like one. The lifelike visuals and smattering of highly detailed interactions feel at odds with its rougher, less immersive edges, giving the world a sometimes strange and sterile atmosphere. Even so, there’s a surprising amount of depth hidden amongst these blind spots, and I’m keen to see if inZOI can deliver on its monumental promises – both in the long-term, and as I work toward my final review of what’s here at launch in the coming weeks.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><span>Hitting is one of the most frustrating yet rewarding experiences in all of </span><a href="///">MLB The Show 25</a><span>.</span> One moment, you're sending balls into the stands; the next, you can't seem to hit a single pitch coming your way. While you can go through slumps, just like MLB players do in real life, your struggles with hitting could come down to something as simple as your settings.</p><p>In MLB The Show 25, the ideal hitting style uses the "Zone" Hitting Interface. This interface allows you to more accurately get the barrel of your bat on the ball. The Zone interface is also the only option that allows for the use of PCI, or Plate Control Indicator. PCI is an entirely different ballgame in the settings menu, and going through the various options can get confusing.</p><p>To ensure you have the best chance to hit in MLB The Show 25, check out the guide to see the top PCI settings.</p><h2>Best PCI Settings in MLB The Show 25</h2><p>You can change your PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 by going to the settings menu, selecting "Gameplay," and then scrolling down the "Hitting" section of the settings. As previously mentioned, you can only use PCI settings if you have the Zone Hitting Interface selected. If you have the other two options, Timing or Directional, all of the PCI settings will be locked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524"></a><figcaption>The hitting menu in MLB The Show 25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg"></figure><p>The PCI settings encompass a few different areas. You have how the PCI is set up when certain pitchers are on the mound, how the PCI looks at the plate, and whether you can see the PCI icon or not. There are over a dozen PCI-specific settings in the hitting menu, and the game doesn't do a terrific job of explaining what each one does.</p><p>Fortunately, you can view the list below to see every PCI setting laid out and what we recommend for every option:</p><ul><li><strong>PCI Anchor</strong>: This determines if the PCI icon appears in a specific spot depending on what type of pitcher is on the mound. It's usually better to have this off if you want to have full control over the PCI, but you can also enable it if you're just learning how to hit.</li><li><strong>RHP vs RHH, RHP vs. LHH, LHP vs. RHH, RHP vs. RHH</strong>: These can only be changed if you have enabled the PCI Anchor. If you have the anchor enabled, you can choose where the PCI Anchor is parked when each pitcher/hitter scenario arises.</li><li><strong>Free Anchor Reset</strong>: Batter</li><li><strong>PCI Anchor Dots</strong>: On if you are using the PCI Anchor</li><li><strong>Plate Coverage Indicator</strong>: This setting determines whether the PCI icon appears in the strikezone when you're up to bat. Generally, most players want this enabled, as it can get difficult to know where you're swinging without seeing the indicator.</li><li><strong>PCI Center</strong>: Diamonds. This has been the PCI meta for years, as Diamonds don't take up too much room but they're easy to see</li><li><strong>PCI Inner</strong>: Starfighter. This is more preference, but Starfighter is the best all-around option. You can use Basic if you're just learning how to use PCI.</li><li><strong>PCI Outer</strong>: None. This helps to reduce the size of the PCI icon and gets rid of some extra distraction that you really don't need.</li><li><strong>PCI Color</strong>: A bright color that you can see easily. Most players use the standard Yellow color, but you can also use Red or something else. You could go the other way as well and use Black, but that can get lost in the background of a field sometimes.</li><li><strong>PCI Opacity</strong>: 80%. This increases or reduces how transparent the PCI icon is. You want it mostly visible but still a little see-through so it doesn't become too distracting on the screen.</li><li><strong>PCI Fadeout</strong>: None. This either makes it so the PCI icon fades before a pitch is delivered or it stays on the screen until you swing the bat. This is mostly personal preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525"></a><figcaption>The preferred PCI settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg"></figure><p>Those are some baseline PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 that can work for new and veteran players alike. It's also recommended to head into a practice mode and try out different settings so you have a better idea of what you prefer.</p><p>Some MLB The Show players like the Bat PCI Center, as it allows them to visualize swinging a pitch better. However, others prefer no center and just like a couple of dots on their screen so they can focus more on the pitch. The PCI color is also completely up to you, as everyone has a different eyesight.</p><p>If you're just looking for some basic PCI settings that you can set and never touch again, you have them. However, this is also just a foundation, as you can fiddle with the individual settings more and more as you continue to use the PCI system in MLB The Show 25.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> studio Hazelight has invited two players to Sweden to see its next game after they completed a secret level so challenging, "there are barely people on our team that can make it."
</p>
<p>
Laser Hell, as the level is known, can found toward the end of Split Fiction's Isolation chapter, specifically during the Maximum Security level. In order to access it, players are required to enter the binary code found on a bit of Skotos signage using the elevator floor buttons nearby. With that done and both players in place, the elevator begins its descent into Laser Hell.
</p>
<p>
This rock-hard secret area is essentially a five-stage laser gauntlet, requiring players to navigate its perils and get to the end unscathed. Success, if it ever comes, is rewarded with a video message from Split Fiction director Josef Fares, congratulating the victors on crossing the finishing line. "Wow, amazing," he says. "This challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it... It took us a lot of time to finish it... This is a crazy, crazy achievement."

<p>
And how do we know about Fares' secret message? That's thanks to the skills of two Chinese content creators, E1uM4y and Sharkov, who <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/">both recorded their journey through Laser Hell</a> for all to see. But it doesn't end there. Fares continued by promising the first pair to complete the secret area would be invited to visit Hazelight for an early look at its next game - and he's now <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068">confirmed he'll be sticking to his work in a post on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Congrats to 'sharkOvO' and 'E1uM4y' for finishing the secret challenge Laser Hell in Split Fiction," he wrote. "VERY impressive! I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We'll be in touch!"
</p>
<p>
As to what that new game is, it's currently being kept firmly under wraps - in large part because it's still very early days. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ">recent conversation with the Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Fares said he was "fully-focused and excited on the next thing that we already have started", confirming it had only been in development for around a month.
</p>
<p>
Whatever it is, it'll be one to keep an eye on. Split Fiction, the follow-up to Hazelight's much-loved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, launched to massive critical acclaim earlier this month, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>, where we called it "one of most inventive and joyful co-op games to date". And it's resonated with players too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">shifting over 2m copies since its release</a>.

Their three-minute video showcases not only what a successful run looks like but also the hellish tasks that await inside it. Split Ficition’s Laser Hell level is a gauntlet of demanding platforming challenges that see players dodging up and around a series of laser rooms, but it is doable — and there’s a special video for those who see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As demonstrated in E1uM4y and Sharkov’s video, reaching the end of Split Fiction’s hardest level rewards Mio and Zoe with a clip recorded by Hazelight’s own Josef Fares. After opening the video with applause, he says he’s “super amazed” by anyone who was able to beat the level while joking that his praise isn’t for “you guys who are looking (at) this on YouTube.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wow. Amazing. You have to understand, this challenge, there are barely people on our team that can make it,” Fares says in the video. “It took us a lot of time to finish it. I’m telling you; this is a crazy, crazy achievement you have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a feat worth celebrating indeed, but wait, there’s more! Fares promises that the first pair of players who manage to beat Split Fiction’s Laser Hell level and confirm their success will be flown out to Hazelight in Sweden for an early look at the studio’s next game along with a few “other surprises.” It’s a promise that the director personally followed up on and confirmed in <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Congrats to ”sharkOvO” and ”E1uM4y” for finishing the secret challenge ”Laser Hell” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#splitficton</a>.

All you need to do is input a binary code listed under a Skotos label at the location shown, have your partner stand beside you, and you’ll be taken down to a room where you’ll surely spend countless attempts trying to see Fares’ video in person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what exactly Hazelight will be showing E1uM4y and Sharkov, those details remain a mystery. Fares recently shared that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-dev-calls-ea-a-good-partner-as-hazelight-begins-work-on-next-game"><u>the studio has been working on its next project for around a month</u></a> but declined to spill much in terms of its story, name, or release plans. We do know, at least, that the Hazelight team is “very excited” about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction launched earlier this month for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and quickly became yet another co-op success for the studio. After securing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>1 million sales in just 48 hours</u></a>, Mio and Zoe’s story pulled a total of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-hits-2-million-sales-after-just-1-week"><u>2 million in just one week</u></a>.

She really is the Golden Teppo, and she leaves you with a stern warning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462021" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462021"></a><figcaption>Yes, confronting Wakasa is the correct decision.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="What_happens_if_you_confront_Otama_">What happens if you confront Otama?</h3><p>If you choose to confront Otama, well, then that's quite a bummer indeed. Even though Otama is a mean lady, she's not the actual mercenary that you're looking for. This decision causes her to run away, and you have to give chase and take her down. You're then left with a note saying that she's still a corrupt person, though Naoe learns that Wakasa is the true culprit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462022"></a><figcaption>Otama might not be a very nice person, but she's not your quarry either.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Taking_out_the_Golden_Teppo">Taking out the Golden Teppo</h3><p>Regardless of your decision on confronting either Otama or Wakasa in Assassin's Creed Shadows, you do get to face the Golden Teppo (Wakasa) once you're ready.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, Chicago-based, solo independent developer Shared Memory, headed up by Billy Basso, released its first game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Offering a combat-free approach to the exploration platformer genre (also known as a Metroidvania), Animal Well garnered a wealth of acclaim and praise for its highly stylized design ethos. Once the project was complete, its file size clocked in at a microscopic 33MB. Even compared to other independent games at this scale, shipping a game that takes up less than one-tenth of a gigabyte on a hard drive signifies a feat of technical wizardry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appropriately, Basso hosted a talk titled, “Developing at 5MB per Year: The Making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” at the Game Developers Conference this week. Focused on both the scratch coding he used to code the game and the discipline required to stick with a seven-year project, Basso spilled some of his secrets to making such an impressive—and small—game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, he broke down the tools he used for various parts of the game, saying, “I used Visual Studio for code. That actually covers a lot of development because you don’t really get a level editor when you’re not using Unity or Unreal, so there’s a lot of good data in the game that’s hard-coded in C++ files. I did make my own custom level editor that’s kinda built into the game that can be toggled on and off.” For the sprite and pixel art, he used the program Aseprite for the pixel art, mentioning that he modified the program itself on GitHub after coming up with a bespoke animation format. And for audio production, Basso used Reaper, another common choice for smaller developers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But here is where Basso began to deviate from his peers. Addressing the discipline and workflow side of managing a solo project like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for nearly a decade, he said, “For design and sort of task-tracking production stuff, I would just open up text files in Notepad on my desktop.” The crowd chuckled a little before he followed up, “I wouldn’t even name them or save them. I’d just type things in them and then when all the tasks were complete, I would close and then Windows would warn me ‘You might wanna save.’” This got even more shocked laughs from the packed convention hall.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Returning to the development tools he used, Basso demonstrated the various modes of his homebrewed level editor. Using a tool that resembles Super Mario Maker’s level editor, he showed the palette of every sprite and tile in the game, adding “I could just pick one and sort of paint them around. [Designing levels] was just a matter of drawing these sprites and making the screens with all the basic kind of Photoshop-y tools.” Basso described a handful of Photoshop-inspired tools like the eye dropper and paint bucket. He even went into the Photoshop install files and extolled the application’s paint bucket icon because he liked that tool so much.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals" target="_self" data-discover="true">The technical magic behind Doctor Strange's portals in Marvel Rivals</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exactly 256 rooms in ">Exactly 256 rooms in <span>Animal Well</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He used these tools to fit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world into a 16-by-16-room grid, making exactly 256 separate rooms. Basso said, “I couldn’t create any more because every room had a one-byte ID to it, so it only had 256 possible values.” That was a deliberate choice on his part to avoid any kind of scope creep where possible. Instead, he says he focused on getting the absolute most out of each of the rooms, adding, “I just focused on making every room as dense as possible. It was kind of a fun constraint.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> received glowing praise thanks in no small part to its dense, efficient use of its detailed world map. Cramming the entire map into a one-byte system feels appropriate for a game that was hailed by players for its Swiss watch-like complexity and attention to detail.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.
