<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af87bff3bf78a/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CDPR</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7fExZx1QyU">Digital Foundry</a> has posted its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> on the Switch 2, putting the game through its paces to see just how the main story and Phantom Liberty expansion hold up on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>To start, DF notes that the inclusion of Phantom Liberty itself is pretty remarkable given that developer CD Projekt Red opted to skip PS4 and Xbox One, favouring the beefier hardware seen in current-gen systems. The fact that the Switch 2 is able to handle this at all is commendable, but it should be said that this is where the hardware struggles the most.</p>
<p>As standard, Cyberpunk 2077 offers up four visual modes: 30fps quality and 40fps performance, with both also available as separate handheld options. Here's how each mode handles resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handheld Performance - 640x360 - 1280x720</li>
<li>Handheld Quality - 800x450 - 1440x810</li>
<li>Docked Performance - 960x540 - 1920x1080</li>
<li>Docked Quality - 1280x720 - 1920x1080</li>
</ul>
<p>DLSS is in use, but it's noted that high-paced action can cause a few visual hiccups, such as blurriness and temporal noise. However, outside of resolution, there's actually very little difference in visual quality between docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>When compared to other consoles, the Switch is running at the same texture quality setting as the PS5, putting it above Xbox Series X and PS4. Many in-game textures are purposefully the same across all platforms, but where there is a difference, the Switch 2 is actually one of the more accomplished consoles in this respect. Similarly, DLSS is put to great use, making image clarity a lot better on the Switch 2 when compared to the PS4.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the Switch 2 is a lot closer to the PS4 when it comes to pedestrian and vehicle density, so if the streets of Night City look a little quiet on the Switch 2, then you know why. It's largely done to ensure stable frame rates, but DF does still state that what the console is able to achieve is "impressive". With shadows, it's noted that indoor settings produce higher quality shadows than those seen on PS4, but outdoor shadows produced by the sun are actually slightly worse.</p>
<p>With frame rate, the Switch 2 holds up well, sticking to the 30fps target in quality mode for the main story. In the Phantom Liberty expansion, however, the more complex design of the environment causes frame rates on Switch 2 to drop as low as 20-25.</p>
<p>In the 40fps performance mode, the overall experience is a little bit of a mixed bag. Indoor areas are smoother, holding at around 40fps for the most part, but outdoor sections and busy shootouts actually cause the frame rate to drop down to 30fps or even slightly lower.</p>
<p>Finally, when playing handheld, it's estimated that frame rates are largely the same as docked, though DF isn't able to test this area properly. Thanks to VRR, however, it's said that portable play is probably the smoothest experience on Switch 2, though in instances where performance does drop below 30fps, it's a lot more noticeable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-will-continue-to-adjust-playstation-plus-pricing-says-more-players-are-choosing-the-extra-and-premium-tiers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation and business segment meeting</a>, the latest update on PlayStation Plus from Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer, Hideaki Nishino, confirmed that Sony will continue to adjust its pricing strategy around PlayStation Plus, as the company is seeing that players are "<em>increasingly choosing our Premium and Extra tiers</em>."</p>
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus has increased twice so far in this generation, with the first major increase happening in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23852353/playstation-plus-prices-increase-essential-extra-premium">2023</a> and the next one just a couple of months ago in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">April 2025</a> (though the most recent increase applied only to major regions outside the US).</p>
<p>PS Plus is getting more expensive, and yet, despite the uproar around Sony increasing the price while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">seemingly giving players fewer first-party offerings</a> and the snail pace with which games are added to the Classics catalog of games available at the Premium tier, more players are choosing to pay for the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>
<p>"<em>We are focused on driving profitable growth by increasing engagement and appeal, and by continuously improving the service proposition and the content that we offer players and subscribers,</em>" Nishino said.</p>
<p>"<em>As a result, subscribers are increasingly choosing Premium and Extra tiers, which now represent approximately 38% of all subscribers.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a separate 'Fireside Chat' video that was released alongside the business segment presentation, Nishino was asked more directly about the PS Plus price increases, and how frequently he sees PlayStation being able to raise the price of the service.</p>
<p>"<em>PlayStation Plus is highly valued by our players and continues to drive engagement</em>," he began. "<em>We are already seeing a trend towards the option of higher tiers within our service, as evidenced by the subscriber mix we achieved in FY2024, where approximately 38% are now subscribed to PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra tier. This is even after the global price increases we implemented in FY2023, and more recently, the local price increases in selected countries to improve our pricing strategy across certain market clusters, and also to account for [foreign exchange] movements</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These price increases were partly a result of increasing value we bring to the players, through the quality and diversity of content we continue to add, as well as investment in features to improve the service further, such as player personalization and enhanced content discovery. The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value, and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability</em>."</p>
<p>Nishino isn't directly confirming that we should expect more price increases, but maximizing profitability for a product, while adding features to it, doesn't usually equal a price decrease for that product.</p>
<p>For how upset players seem to get about the price increases when they happen, the numbers show that, increasingly, there's more who don't care that the price is going up, and want to keep paying for at least the Extra tier to get access to the large catalog of games available at the higher levels of PS Plus.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's recent openness to bringing its biggest Xbox Series X|S games to PlayStation 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">a boon for sales</a>. But the benefits for Xbox owners may not go both ways, as a trio of big upcoming Microsoft-published games are skipping physical releases on Xbox Series X|S. PS5 gamers, on the other hand, will be able to get physical editions of all three.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> are the three games in question, as seen on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FCJY74BS,B0FCJHHYZY,B0FCJTVGKZ,B0FCJC4CQJ,B0FCJYV9DY,B0FCJFY734,B0FCHZ55LQ&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. But it doesn't appear to be a case of Microsoft favoring PS5 over its own console. Instead, it seems to be part of Microsoft's broader push towards digital-only releases.</p><p>Instead of coming with a physical disc, The Other Worlds 2 and Ninja Gaiden 4 will only be packaged with a download code in Series X|S boxes. Strangely enough, Gears of War: Reloaded won't even have that physical option. It's strictly a digital release except on PS5.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer indicated that the majority of Xbox game sales are digital. Spencer also said that Microsoft was simply "following what the customers are doing." But the shift away from physical releases appears to be accelerating for Microsoft this year. That may be in part due to the uncertainty over whether the gaming industry will be seriously affected by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p><p>Of the three games, Gears of War: Reloaded will be released first on August 26 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Ninja Gaiden 4 and The Outer Worlds 2 will follow on all three platforms on October 20 and October 29, respectively. Brandon Adler, the game director of The Outer Worlds 2, recently shared his response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">Microsoft setting the price for that sequel at $80</a>.</p>

                <p>Epic Games surprised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> fans on Friday when it <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1933515577580024139" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that the next update, which was slated to introduce Season 9 of Fortnite Festival next Tuesday, has been delayed. Fortunately, the delay is about as short as it can get, as the patch has been pushed back just one day to Wednesday, June 18. Epic gave no reason for the delay.</p><p>The move is a surprising one, as it's rare for a patch to be delayed in advance by just a day. Normally, Epic doesn't openly discuss patch timing--it just deploys it when it's ready with half a day's notice. This patch gets a public acknowledgement of its delay because it comes with the new Festival season launch, which has been scheduled for June 17 for months. The delay means that the current Sabrina Carpenter pass <a href="https://x.com/FNFestStatus/status/1933516051834094022" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be extended</a> by one day.</p><p>Usually when a patch gets bumped from Tuesday to Wednesday it's because that week's Monday was a holiday--Epic doesn't deploy big updates when its employees aren't in the office. While June 16 is not a US holiday, there is one later in the week: Juneteenth, on Thursday. It could be that Epic is observing the holiday early instead of during the middle of the week.</p><p>While Season 9 of Fortnite Festival was long rumored to have Daft Punk as its headlining act, it's now looking as though the featured artist will actually be Deadmau5. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-super/2900-6649/" data-ref-id="2900-6649">the new superhero season</a> began in Battle Royale on June 7, the updated map included <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1931444514658422923" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadmau5 posters</a>, similar to the way Epic teased Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter ahead of their season launches. While it's not yet confirmed that Deadmau5 is headlining, he's by far the most plausible candidate right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been checking out a lot of new Switch 2 accessories recently, almost all of which were produced before the companies that made them ever touched a real Switch 2. Even a millimeter’s difference in dimensions could completely throw off a design, and some products I’ve tried lack a perfect fit. For example, Genki’s Attack Vector <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l7hpz6/warning_for_switch_2_owners_who_bought_an_attack/">has problems</a>, which the company is now reworking. It’s probably not the only one. However, Dbrand’s Killswitch kit offers the best fit and best protection right out of the gate.</p><p>I adored the kit when I tested it on my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/28/23373094/dbrand-project-killswitch-steam-deck-case-magnet-stand">Steam Deck</a>, and this one doesn’t mess with the winning formula. Dbrand had to engineer its own USB-C dock adapter since a Killswitch-equipped console doesn’t fit in Nintendo’s dock. Its adapter is included, with no cutbacks to visual fidelity in docked mode. It’s a little clunky, but I’m mainly just happy that it works, so I don’t have to take the Killswitch off every time I want to dock the Switch 2.</p><p>The most basic “Essentials” kit is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$59.95</a> and includes a grippy, form-fitting shell that latches around the Switch 2’s back, slightly latching around the front. It can be secured to your console with some small adhesive strips. A separate, adhesive-backed strip of protection for the kickstand comes with the kit, too. Dbrand includes two Joy-Con 2 shells that have thick, textured grips that make them significantly more comfortable to use without adding too much weight. Unlike Joy-Con shells from other accessory makers, these were as easy to install as I hoped they would be, sliding securely into place thanks to the Killswitch’s tough, but just-malleable-enough materials.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Each component that attaches to the Switch 2 is malleable enough to easily fit onto its pieces, but secure enough not to wiggle off.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$79.85</a> “Travel” option adds a tough latch-on cover that protects the front of your Switch 2, and a tray that fits within it for storing up to 10 game cartridges. Of the cases I’ve tried so far, I have the fewest reservations about putting my Switch 2 in this one. With the front cover on, it provides hard case protection. When detached, it offers solid protection with an understated look for the parts of the Switch 2 that are most vulnerable to damage.</p><p>The most expensive <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fkillswitch%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases" rel="sponsored">$99.80</a> “Ultra” kit includes everything mentioned above, plus additional stick grips and two glass screen protectors. The added cost isn’t outrageous if you still need a screen protector.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Killswitch secures to the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 with a small lip that keeps it on. And yet, it’s simple to remove if you want to.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Killswitch is great. I often forget that it’s installed. I thought I’d miss the console’s slim design, arguably one of its biggest selling points compared to chunkier handhelds like the Steam Deck. But, after mainly using a Deck instead of the aging Switch, I’m spoiled by big grips, and the Killswitch turns the Switch 2 into something that I want to use in handheld mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you pine for the rotting corridors and tactical limb-surgery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>, it looks like Bloober's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> may have you covered. Fresh from revealing that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remaking the first Silent Hill</a>, the Polish team have released a new trailer for Cronos that shows off more of its bubble-suited third-person gunnery.</p>
<p>In particular, it spotlights the Merge mechanic, whereby guttural tendril beasts known as Orphans devour the corpses of their brethren to enhance their abilities. It's implied that they can do this more than once, so be sure to clean up after yourself. As in so many other walks of life, punctual incineration may be the cure.

<p>
I find the trailer interesting for a couple of reasons. The simpler draw is that, yes, this sure does reek of Dead Space, my beloved. In particular, the Merging mechanic calls to mind those awful Necromorph facehugger equivalents who'd scuttle around reanimating cadavers. And let's not forget the crawling arms and legs that'd sneakily join up into a Biggermorph if left unattended. How I hated them. Can't fault the animation, though. Excellently horrible.
</p>
<p>
The other reason that interests me is that it's continuing a theme for Bloober, a developer who love to tell stories about torturously overlapping dimensions. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/observer">Observer</a> - Bloober's best game to date, for my money - explored the familiar cyberpunk premise of ailing flesh and masonry corrupted by digital technology. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> gave you a splitscreen view of 90s Poland and an adjoining fungal purgatory inspired by Zdzisław Beksiński's surrealist landscapes. And in Cronos: New Dawn, you're an agent of the "Collective" alternating between a shattered post-apocalypse and the 1980s, your job being to digitise and extract lost souls from the past for safe archiving in the future. All of this reflects Bloober's creative debts to the Silent Hill series, with its parallel realities. 
</p>
<p>
Those themes extend into a mechanical focus on the implications of blending things or splitting them apart. In Observer, the splicing of digital and non-digital realms produces a grating, fizzy nightmare, to be forensically dissected using your bionic eye. In The Medium, you'll cut through seams of flesh with an icky razor even as you try to reconcile the architecture of the mundane and the otherworldly. And in Cronos, you have to worry about merging enemies, which seems to parody the Collective's goal of recovering and pooling the electronic spirits of the long-dead.</p>
<p>I realise this is quite fast-and-loose analysis, but in my defence, I am writing up a 90 second trailer in the fateful closing moments of the working day, racing against the sunset to finish a piece, and it was either this or waxing lyrical about gunfeel. Cronos: The New Dawn is out later this year on Steam and Epic Games Store.

                <p>Amidst Xbox's multiplatform publishing strategy, Sony is reiterating its commitment to prioritizing the PlayStation 5. During a recent <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony business meeting</a> and "fireside chat," PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst stated the company is taking a "very measured, very deliberate approach" when it comes to deciding if and when a first-party title appears on other platforms like PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony has been porting many of its marquee titles to PC for years. Some of its more recent live-service titles, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> and the short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a>, released day-and-date on console and PC, while tentpole single-player games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> typically release on PS5 first and arrive at least a year later on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about the industry's move towards multiplatform titles and how Sony is looking to protect the "value" of the PS5 console, Hulst indicated that Sony isn't looking to change its current strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's important to realize that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that," Hulst said. "Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to say that Sony's first-party titles are meant to be a showcase for the PS5 hardware, and that the company wants players to "get the best experience" from these titles playing on PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're very thoughtful about how and if and how we bring these titles to other platforms," Hulst said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an approach that appears to be working, even as Microsoft doubles down on its multiplatform game strategy of releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-games-are-doing-super-well-on-playstation-store-publisher-tops-preorder-charts/1100-6531273/" data-ref-id="1100-6531273">Xbox titles on PS5 with positive results</a>. When asked about Microsoft's strategy and whether or not it's a good thing, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino said he believed competition in the industry is good and creates innovation, but that Sony is "confident and committed to our current strategy."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to discussing how its approaching platform exclusivity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">Sony reiterated its commitment to live-service titles</a>, with Hulst stating he doesn't believe Bungie's upcoming shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a> will suffer the same fate as Concord.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is shaking things up with its new strategy of launching its own games on rival platforms, and now Sony has reacted to Microsoft's latest moves. As part of an<a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> investor fireside chat</a>, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was asked to respond to speculation from investors that Microsoft is "moving away from the console."</p><p>To be clear, Microsoft has made no announcements about moving away from building hardware, and in fact, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already said it's working on its next console</a>. In any event, Nishino responded by saying Microsoft trying something new and creating an additional competitive element in the gaming landscape by launching more of its games on rival systems is "healthy and pushes us to innovate."</p><p>"There are multiple participants who together drive the overall game industry, and while there are new engagement models being explored, we ultimately think this is a good thing," he said. "However, as I mentioned earlier, we are confident and committed on our current strategy, and there isn't an urgent need for us to pivot. We will continue to monitor play patterns and invest appropriately as required."</p><p>The next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-how-to-get-in-whats-in-it-start-times-and-more/1100-6532379/" data-ref-id="1100-6532379">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, which debuts in August, representing the first time the Gears franchise will be available outside of Xbox and PC. Microsoft recently launched Doom: The Dark Ages on PlayStation, and the company's biggest series, Call of Duty, is developed for both Xbox and PlayStation systems.</p><p>Microsoft's Xbox platform is understood to be the lowest-selling of the main three when compared against Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch devices. Microsoft is no longer pushing Xbox hardware as much as it once was, as it's rolled out a new marketing campaign saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">you don't need to buy an Xbox</a> because many of the products you may already own can play Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles make money, but games and services are more lucrative. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream. Bringing Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo devices is another way Microsoft can make more money as well.</p><p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">time and again repeated his comments that Xbox is a business</a>, and his job is to grow that business, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">even if it means laying people off, closing studios, and cancelling games. </a></p><p>Also during the presentation, Sony management <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/" data-ref-id="1100-6532420">briefly discussed the PlayStation 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-doesnt-sound-too-concerned-about-switch-2-even-after-a-record-breaking-debut/1100-6532425/" data-ref-id="1100-6532425">responded to the record-breaking launch of the Switch 2.</a> Sony also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-playstations-current-pc-port-strategy-to-change-anytime-soon/1100-6532428/" data-ref-id="1100-6532428">discussed its strategy for PC releases.</a></p>

<p>For the dreamers!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="switch 2 demo kiosks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c0f6cb2fc69d/switch-2-demo-kiosks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Joey Chiu / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's been absolutely flipping ages since this particular writer has had a go at a good old-fashioned demo kiosk for a Nintendo console (although many, many hours were spent on a SNES one in my local Woolworths back in the day), and so it's very exciting to see them out in the wild and being deployed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a>. Nostalgia: it gets us every time.</p>
<p>Yes, we love a good demo kiosk, as you can maybe tell, and we're excited to see that gamers are beginning to spot Switch 2-flavoured kiosks being delivered and set up at various locations in the US, this time in a Target, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9uqpc/nintendo_switch_2_demo_kiosks/">As seen over on Reddit</a>, the Nintendo-red setups enable anyone to get a shot on a bunch of titles. There's no half-measures here, you don't even have to get an angry staff member to switch the cart out when you want to try something else. Now that's progress.</p>

<p>As you can see from the selection of images above, it seems as though potential Switch 2 owners (or people like us who just can't walk past a chance to play something, even if we already own it) can select from the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nice!</p>
<p>The images also show a kiosk with both a Switch and Switch 2 demoed side by side, and everything seems reasonably peaceful. So, no sibling rivalry has set in just yet, then.</p>
<p>Demos on the kiosk in the pics apparently last 10 minutes, and a quick press of the Home button allows you to get back to selecting something else. We sort of want one of these now. Does anyone have Mario's phone number?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Have you seen any Switch 2 demo kiosks around? In fact, when was the last time you even had a shot on a demo kiosk?</em></p>

			<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian will launch on PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, on&nbsp;<strong>September 26, 2025</strong>. It will also release on PS4, though the PS4 release will only be made available in Japan.</p>
<p>A new 'first look' into the game from Koei Tecmo debuts the first new trailer for the game since it was first announced last year, digging into the new characters introduced in Atelier Resleriana, and a first look at some gameplay.</p>
<p>The story of Atelier Resleriana follows two protagonists on the continent of Lantarna, Rias Eidreise and Slade Clauslyter, who are charged with figuring out why citizens of Hallfein have disappeared, while simultaneously trying to restore their own hometown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian - First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aw0Sq119Yfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This release will be the second game in the Atelier series to come out in 2025, after Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land came out on consoles and PC this past March.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-make-aladiss-great-again/">In his review, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wrote</a>, "<em>Sometimes too over-simplified, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land charts a new path for the series as they try to draw in new players that might have found the mandatory crafting and time limits of earlier Atelier titles too daunting.</em>"</p>
<p>We'll see in September if this latest entry into the series will continue that trend, and if Koei Tecmo and developer Gust have been able to find a new balance between keeping things simple for new players while also complex enough for veteran players to dig into the minutiae of the game's systems.</p>

Developers like BioWare go through so many artistic iterations of a game within normal development cycles, so you can imagine how many more a game like <em>The Veilguard </em>had when it was rebooted twice and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416">in development for a decade</a></span>. The cool thing is that when we do get a concept art drop, we get an in-depth look at what could have been, or in this case, we get some pretty rad art of characters we already know and love, which we can use as phone wallpapers or possibly print out to display as decoration.</p><p>Volta Studio, a company that makes concept art for games and movies, recently updated its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.artstation.com/voltastudio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.artstation.com/voltastudio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtStation</a></span> account with several pieces from its work on <em>The Veilguard</em>. If you’ve played the game or read its art book, a fair bit of this will be familiar to you. However, there’s one set I want to draw attention to, and it’s the character posters Volta worked on for each party member, as well as for Varric, the player’s dwarven peepaw, and the elven trickster god Solas.</p><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s marketing campaign focused on the party above all else. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">The characters you befriend and woo</a></span> are typically the draw of BioWare’s games, so it makes sense that the studio would want to spotlight them as much as possible in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">trailers</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-podcast-vows-vengeance-1851629597">podcasts</a></span>, and promotional art. At some point, this included some incredible character art for the team that is maybe some of the best art we’ve ever had of the group. Each piece captures a particular character’s personality, aesthetics, and story in one clean shot.</p><p>To call out a few favorites, I really love the Solas, Davrin, and Emmrich pieces. The cool blue tones on Solas give him an air of god-like power, and his dread wolf namesakes appear alongside him as loyal pets. He wasn’t intimidating when he debuted in 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, but he sure is here. Davrin is my <em>Veilguard</em> boo, but I promise I’m not being biased giving him a shoutout here. He and our griffon son Assan look fucking sick here, with the beast perched on the Warden’s back and defending him with his wing. That being said, I think the Emmrich piece is my favorite. Seeing the mage surrounded by adoring skeletons, including one that lovingly caresses his face, captures both his love of necromancy and his gentle romantic side. Click through to see all nine.</p><p>All this concept art is cool to look back on, but it does bring to mind the sad state of BioWare after publisher EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767">gutted the studio</a></span> following <em>The Veilguard</em>’s disappointing sales.

I got a chance to sit down with Bloober’s time-hopping latest and find out what makes the world of Cronos so compelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cronos puts you in control of a character called The Traveler, a woman tasked with going into areas ravaged by a human-eliminating virus that is rapidly transforming them into monsters. The Traveler’s goal is to not only log her observations and find human survivors, but also to lay a path for Travelers that come after her – just as those who came before her did. But that task is easier said than done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The theme of this game is merging and changing into something new,” co-director Wojciech Piejko explains, before adding, “Hey, this is not a good way to actually play this game, but watch this.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Piejko proceeds to wake up a sleeping enemy with a stomp that can only be described as Dead Space-esque. Upon waking, the enemy noticed that the corpses of other monsters were littered around, and quickly went to consume one. Then another. Then a third. By the time the infected human had finished feasting (uninterrupted by Piejko), it had “merged” several times, essentially leveling up its monster type. In doing so, it became stronger, harder to kill, more aggressive, and had access to new abilities to take The Traveler out, such as spitting toxic bile at her. After a fair amount of ammo, it finally goes down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“This is the core of Cronos,” Piejko says. “Manage your resources, take risks when appropriate, and survive.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only way The Traveler could have prevented this happening is to kill the monster before it has a chance to feast or rid the area of corpses using fire, a precious resource that can’t be used capriciously. That said, bigger monsters mean bigger rewards, so it is sometimes a good choice to burn some resources for a bigger payday of crafting materials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is the core of Cronos,” Piejko says. “Manage your resources, take risks when appropriate, and survive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just because a monster does not awaken does not mean The Traveler is safe, however. Anyone that tries to hoard resources will soon discover when backtracking through areas that enemies have a tendency to pick inopportune moments to pop up and start merging with other corpses on the ground. Not being aware of your environment can be a deadly mistake in Cronos, but wasting resources may be even worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo I participated in takes place in Nowa Huta, an eastern district in Krakow, Poland that was once an industrial hub of the former Soviet Union. In the future, it has been torn apart by the monster-plague infecting the world. It is the Traveler’s duty to identify important people that live or lived in the city and employ time-travel to rescue them from the pre-plague age of the 1980s. Since only The Traveler can hop through time, rescuing them involves digitizing their souls to carry around with her to take back into the present.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Traveler is limited in how many souls she can carry with her, which leaves the choice up to the player to decide who gets saved and who does not. This can affect Cronos’s narrative, as different people will have different reactions to things The Traveler encounters and places she goes. As an example, The Traveler can rescue someone in the past and bring them to the future, wherein she visits that person’s apartment decades later and the former tenant describes their life before it all went to hell.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Traveler is limited in how many souls she can carry with her, which leaves the choice up to the player to decide who gets saved and who does not.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example given, two of the souls in possession have a history and go back and forth with each other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloober says that Cronos will contain an emphasis on the studio’s trademark psychological horror despite the action bent. After Silent Hill 2 released, which was developed in parallel with Cronos, the Cronos team absorbed their colleagues (or “merged,” to keep it thematically on-brand) to help finish the game out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and throughout Nowa Huta, The Traveler will come across some less conversational survivors: cats. Kitties are locked away safely in various rooms throughout the game and, upon being rescued, help with resources for The Traveler. All the cats in the game are based on the pets of the developers at Bloober.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had so many submissions we had to start casting for them to decide who would get in,” Piejko says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of their 1-2 punch with Silent Hill 2, Bloober is hoping Cronos proves the studio’s mettle as an industry-leading horror game developer. The New Dawn’s premise and designs are helping it start off on an interesting foot as part of Bloober’s journey there.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Camera 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f0089c56124/switch-2-camera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the lead-up to the Switch 2 launch, one of the biggest talking points from Nintendo was the new GameChat feature and accompanying camera. Heck, the company even reunited with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/paul-rudd-returns-in-an-awesome-snes-style-switch-2-commercial">actor and SNES legend Paul Rudd</a> for a new commercial showcasing the technology: <em>“Now you’re playing together,”</em> as if the previous four decades of multiplayer functionality on Nintendo consoles meant absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>With the confirmation that pretty much any USB-C camera will work with the Switch 2, just how does the official camera actually hold up, though?</p>
<p>Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, overall. It’s a pretty slick piece of hardware that blends in really well with both the Switch 2 itself and whatever TV setup you happen to be rocking at home (oh, and you can also plug it into a laptop and use it as a webcam, if you like). But despite its 1080p resolution, the actual image quality can look a little muddy, particularly if you have to zoom in. Considering its <strong>£49.99 / $54.99</strong> price tag, this is definitely a tad disappointing.</p>

<p>Looking at the camera itself, it’s a surprisingly dinky little thing. I don’t know why I thought it was much bigger prior to launch, but getting my hands on it for the first time revealed that it sits at just 17cm in height. That’s pretty small! In practice, it’s probably just a tad shorter than the length of my hand from the base of my palm to the tip of my middle finger. So definitely nice and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>The base and stand feel as though they’re made from metal, pretty solid and slightly cool to the touch. Meanwhile, the base is cushioned to prevent any scratches on the device or whatever surface you happen to place it on. The camera at the top is housed in a circular casing which feels slightly hollow — brittle, even, like one drop on a hard surface could crack it — but the light weight makes it easy to adjust the viewing angle.</p>

<p>As standard, the camera comes with a USB-C cable which you can use to plug it into the top of console via its secondary USB-C slot, while the other end slots into the camera around its backside. About three-quarters of the way down the camera’s stand is a small clip to tidy the cable away slightly. Finally, a thin dial is situated around the lens: turning this anti-clockwise shields the lens with a small, built-in white cover, definitely handy for when you’re not using the camera but can't be bothered to unplug it.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s a pretty well-made piece of kit; solid, sleek, functional, and inconspicuous enough to simply blend into the background. Where things get a <em>little</em> messy is when you actually start using it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, setup is an absolute breeze. Once you’ve got it plugged into the Switch 2 (and you can use it in docked or handheld mode), you simply create or join a GameChat session, navigate to the quick settings on-screen, and select the camera icon to turn it on. By default, it’ll show your surroundings, but you can activate a filter to remove this.</p>

<p>The main issue is resolution. I imagine that most, like myself, will have the camera set up next to a TV while docked. In an average family environment, chances are you’re going to be sitting a couple of meters away on a comfy couch. This means that the default image is quite far away, and so you’ll appear pretty small on-screen. Great for showing groups of people during gameplay, sure, (and the camera can pick out four faces), but not if you're on your own.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is you can zoom in via settings to the point where your head takes up most of the image space, but in doing so, the image gets extremely fuzzy.</p>
<p>Of course, the other option is to place the camera a bit nearer, if you’re able. In a lot of living room settings, this might not be entirely feasible, but if you’re playing in a small office environment on a desk or something, then you can probably get pretty close and alleviate those resolution issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the zoom functionality, you can also apply the aforementioned background filter to the image (a system-wide thing and not limited to the official camera). It’s nothing too extravagant, but the two options effectively remove your immediate surroundings. One keeps the overall composition intact, but makes it so that only you display in the image. This is reasonably well done, but be prepared to see a bit of jank around your head and body.</p>

<p>The other display option crops the image down to just your head within a small circle, again applying the same filter to remove anything in the background. The jank from the previous filter still crops up here, and it can be a little irritating in isolation, but when you’re knee-deep in a Knockout Rally on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, chances are you won’t notice it.</p>
<p>What's odd, however, is that Mario Kart World specifically recommends this filter, and I can't quite nail down why. I imagine it's to really hone in on the 'fun, whimsical' nature of the game, but the default setting with no filters applied looks undeniably cleaner.</p>
<p>The only other thing worth noting is that there’s no way to mount the camera on the Switch 2 itself when playing in handheld mode. This is an advantage currently enjoyed by Hori's Piranha Plant Camera, which you can plug into the USB-C slot at the top and carry about with you; I imagine that would definitely come in handy for those quick handheld sessions on the go.</p>
<p>That said, Nintendo's camera does boast a higher resolution, so which you ultimately opt for will depend on what you value more: slightly higher image quality or more flexibility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the elegant, sleek design of the official Switch 2 camera, we would have expected the same kind of 'wow' factor to be present in the actual image quality on display. Alas, despite the 1080p resolution, any scenario in which you need to zoom in at all makes the image incredibly fuzzy.</p>
<p>That said, in practice, the novelty of seeing your friends' faces after you've chucked a Blue Shell at them in Mario Kart World is a genuine blast and, in that context, concerns about image quality generally fade away. We've no doubt that third parties will come out with more accomplished, feature-rich cameras in the future, but for now, Nintendo's official offering is a solid, albeit nonessential option.</p>

            <p>There aren't many games lately which have compelled me to do a tweet, or skeet, or whatever you prefer to call ejaculating one's thoughts out onto the socials. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">The Trolley Solution</a>'s Steam Next Fest demo not only did that, it convinced me to post a tweet I didn't even write.</p>
<p>It's a game from indie dev <a href="https://x.com/byDanDans?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">byDanDans</a> that starts off as a series of moral quandaries, each inspired by philosopher Philippa Foot's famous and now also thoroughly memed-to-death Trolley Problem. That being a thought experiment which forces you examine the ethics of either letting nature take its course to deliver one outcome that could cause harm to others, or actively intervening to cause another that might do the same in a different fashion. I didn't go in expecting to become enraptured in what I can only describe as a tragic rail romance.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At first, things were as I'd anticipated. Upon firing the game up, you're transported to a main menu that fittingly sees you move a tram along some tracks to different stations, each of which takes you to a minigame offering some fresh twist on the classic Trolley Problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes you're choosing whether to let five people tied to one track die, or flick a lever that'll doom a person on another track instead. In one case, your girlfriend and best friend are on the two tracks, having cheated together without the friend knowing it was your partner they were engaging in hanky-panky with. Also, the friend has a terminal disease and will die in a month anyway.</p>
<p>You know, the standard stuff very smart people think about while washing their pits in the shower. One makes you choose between virtual people dying, and the game asking for permission to post <a href="https://x.com/MrMarkWarren99/status/1932533689813967122">a very controversial tweet</a> via your very real Twitter account, assuming you've not abandoned the Musk platform because using carrier pigeons is far superior.</p>

<p>Then, not long after a game based around picking which track didn't have a cat hiding under the giant plastic cup perched on it, I pulled into a station dubbed "Mai tomori sama romansu". It soon became apparent this was not your standard tram stop.</p>
<p>I found myself flung headlong into a visual novel-style story about a schoolgirl named Tameko, her best mate Tomadochi, and their mortal enemy, a superficial and popular former friend named Teki. Added to this triple T triangle is a Trolley, because this still is The Trolley Solution, lest you forget. I'll not spoil what happens in this short multiple-choice and marvellously meta mirage amid the funny puzzling, save for one thing.</p>
<p>Tameko falls, to a degree of your choosing, in love with a tram. He goes by Trolley-San and keep pulling up and saying "Ding Ding" in what I can only assume by Tameko's reactions to be an incredibly suave and seductive fashion. This and all the rest of the game - and I can't emphasise this enough, are a right hoot, a great laugh, and a throaty chuckle.</p>
<p>So, if you find yourself at the Steam Next Fest intersection and aren't sure which direction to pull the big games lever, I can thoroughly recommend yanking it The Trolley Solution's way. Especially since the full thing's set to come out in Q4 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Orphans are twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity’s darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior—exceptionally aggressive and relentless—turning every encounter into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent them from merging. As previously shown, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. If not, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Exploring the Twisted Realms of the New Dawn</strong></p><p>Additionally, the exciting new trailer reveals part of the story of a mysterious Predecessor—Traveler ND 3500—and their cryptic travel log. Players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the existing Polish district—Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,744 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,422 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> this fall.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Showcase</span></h2><p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Gameplay Showcase Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/byuPbR1Cum0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> could carry forward a feature from GTA 5 with famous real-world artists getting their own in-game radio stations. Rapper Jermaine Dupri said in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le8zt-XrrNg&amp;t=399s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rory and Mal</a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/drake-will-have-his-own-radio-station-in-gta-6-according-to-fellow-rapper-3214593/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's heard that hugely popular rapper Drake "got his own radio station in Grand Theft Auto."</p><p>Dupri didn't mention GTA 6 by name, but Drake has never had a radio station in the GTA series before, so it's assumed he was talking about the new game due out next year. Dupri himself said he was asked as well to "do Grand Theft Auto," but he didn't elaborate on if he signed on or not.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Dupri went on to say that GTA 6's Drake radio station will give Drake the ability to upload music that no one has ever heard before, suggesting artists might debut new music inside GTA 6. In addition to Drake, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-have-dj-khaled-in-game-radio-station-report/1100-6529567/" data-ref-id="1100-6529567">DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6 as well.</a></p><p>Drake has a connection to Miami, which is a stand-in for GTA 6's Vice City. The music video for his song "God's Plan" was filmed in Miami, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/drake-donates-175k-gods-plan-music-video" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Drake gave out more than $175,000 to Miami locals.</a> DJ Khaled, meanwhile, got his start in the music business in Miami.</p><p>In GTA 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean had his own in-game radio station</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">GTA 4 had a radio station hosted by the late Roy Ayers</a>. Music has long been a major component of the GTA series, and that's expected to continue with GTA 6.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-fan-theories/2900-6585/" data-ref-id="2900-6585">popular theory</a> is that music in GTA 6 won't be limited to when you're in a car. The character Lucia is seen wearing headphones in some GTA 6 images, prompting theories that players will be able to listen to music while they're walking down the street.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally set to launch this year before being delayed so the developers at Rockstar Games could refine and improve the experience for launch.</p>

                <p>Sony's PS5 console will turn five years old in November, and with an eye on the future, the company recently revealed its thoughts on what's next for PlayStation. During a <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/fireside_chat/index.html" rel="nofollow ">business presentation</a> hosted by several top Sony executives, president and CEO Hideaki Nishino responded to a query about future PlayStation hardware and if a next-gen PS6 console was even necessary when cloud gaming has improved over the years.</p><p>According to Nishino, while cloud gaming is "progressing well from a technical standpoint," certain challenging aspects like end-to-end network stability remain out of Sony's control. Nishino added that cloud-based gameplay is still a viable option for gamers and allows them to access more content, but the "local execution" of games--via physical media or content downloaded directly to console hardware--remains in high demand by the majority of PlayStation gamers.</p>

<p>"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p>On the topic of the next-gen PlayStation console, Nishino remained tight-lipped. "Our console business has evolved into a multi-faceted platform, and we now have a large ecosystem of highly engaged players across both the PS5 and PS4 generations, so naturally, there's a huge interest in our next-generation console strategy," Nishino said. "While we cannot share further details at this stage, the future of the platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services."</p><p>What we do know about the PS6 is that it likely won't be out for quite a while yet. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/">if the next PlayStation comes out in 2028</a>, that would feel right to him, given how current console generations typically run for around seven years now.</p><p>In 2024, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/">Intel made a big push to produce chips for the PS6</a>, but Sony decided to stick with AMD. While PlayStation gamers will be in for a long wait, Sony did introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/">mid-gen PS5 refresh last year in the form of the PS5 Pro</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, the team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a> embraced nostalgia for the franchise's past by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nearly-5-years-after-release-halo-infinite-is-finally-getting-grifball/1100-6532044/" data-ref-id="1100-6532044">bringing back Grifball</a>, the popular 4 vs. 4 football-like game. Now, Halo Infinite is taking an even deeper dive into the past by revisiting fan-favorite maps from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-3-review/1900-6179646/" data-ref-id="1900-6179646">Halo 3</a>. As seen in the launch trailer below, it's like a party from 2007.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbWzI0rHM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zvCbWzI0rHM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Halo Studios has unveiled Infinite's <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/delta-arena-halo-3-legacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Delta Arena: Halo 3 Legacy Playlist</a>, which should look very familiar to players who experienced the locations the first time. The complete list of Halo 3-inspired maps is below.</p><ul><li>Isolation</li><li>Snowbound</li><li>Guardian</li><li>Narrows</li><li>Construct</li><li>Ghost Town</li><li>Bookmark</li><li>Cold Storage</li><li>Foundry</li><li>The Pit</li><li>High Ground</li></ul><p>Additionally, Halo 2's Ivory Tower has been remade for the Halo Infinite Forge. And to recreate the throwback conditions of these maps, sprint and clamber have been disabled, friendly player collision has been restored, jump height has been increased, and all players start with either an MA5K Avenger or BR75 Battle Rifle.</p><p>This event will only run through July 8, so enjoy these classic maps while you can. Earlier this year, Halo Infinite revisited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-brings-back-beloved-co-op-mode/1100-6530079/" data-ref-id="1100-6530079">the co-op mode Firefight Classic</a> and more recently introduced a ridiculous new gun <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-adding-one-of-halos-most-absurd-and-incredible-looking-guns-to-date/1100-6531297/" data-ref-id="1100-6531297">called the Mutilator</a>.</p><p>As for the future of the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Halo Studios teased its long-term roadmap</a> last year and revealed that all future Halo games will use Unreal Engine 5.

			<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/vod/20250613/x8R5srwN/bsm_02_en/1_GNS/movie/index.html">annual investors presentation</a>, the company confirmed that as of March 31, 2025, for the first time in this console generation, PS5 monthly active users have surpassed PS4 monthly active users, which means that more players on PlayStation are finally starting to make the transition to the current generation of hardware.</p>
<p>Just last year, when Sony gave this presentation in May 2024, Sony confirmed that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-of-all-playstation-gamers-are-yet-to-upgrade-to-ps5-sony-stats-reveal">split between PS5 and PS4 players was still 50/50</a>. For one reason or another, four years into the PS4 generation, players were not leaving their old consoles behind. In the past year though, that's changed.</p>
<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino was speaking, the presentation featured this slide, showing that PS5 players are taking up the majority of PlayStation's 124 million monthly active users.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the new 124 million active users figure is an increase from the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-registers-new-123-million-monthly-active-users-record-in-december-2023/">123 million active users PlayStation saw in 2023</a>, which was already a record-setting figure for Sony.</p>
<p>"<em>Our platform is stronger than ever</em>," said Nishino. "<em>We continue to attract more players, and we now have over 124M monthly active users. Through the wide range of content and services we provide, these players are more engaged than ever, which has resulted in record-high gameplay hours. Our platform is also more accessible than ever. The PlayStation 5 offers the best way for players to experience our content, and as such, this player base has continued to grow</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>These players are highly engaged, spending more on the content and services than in prior generations,</em>" Nishino continued. "<em>However, the PlayStation 4 remains an important access point for existing players to experience our content and services, and we remain committed to serving them</em>."</p>
<p>During the lead-up to the PlayStation 5's launch, there was plenty of talk about <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-jim-ryan-its-time-to-give-fans-something-that-can-only-be-enjoyed-on-playstation-5">PlayStation believing in generations</a>, only for the company to confirm that most of its big titles coming to PS5 would also be coming to PS4. It's clear that things have changed at this point, with the PS4 still being a big chunk of PlayStation's player base.</p>
<p>In the same annual presentation, PlayStation even confirmed that it is committed to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-committed-to-exploring-a-new-and-enhanced-way-to-engage-with-content-and-services-multiplatform-strategy-set-to-remain-the-same-for-the-foreseeable-future/">multiplatform strategy going into the next generation</a>.</p>
