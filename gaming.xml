What if we could dream it together?</p><p><em>Reverie in the Moonlight</em> is an action game where, with the help of your stuffed animals, you try to defend yourself from the monsters attacking you night after night.</p><p><strong>Nightly Visits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Little Tete’s nights are restless. His dreams are full of horrible monsters attacking him. But then, one night, he meets <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a>, and she teaches him how to use his plushies to defend himself.</p><p><strong>Cute But Strong</strong></p><p>When faced with a monster, Tete can only do one thing: run away. His plushies, however, can actually fight and defeat monsters. Different animals play different roles, with some focusing on short-range attacks, some on long-range shots, and some on supporting their allies. There are 40 types to choose from, so find your favorites and help them protect Tete from the monsters.</p><ul><li><strong>Ham Jr.</strong> – Runs left and right, hitting monsters that get too close with a stick.</li><li><strong>Snoozy-G</strong> – Enjoys sleeping, napping, and resting. Monsters that hit it are slowed down for a while.</li><li><strong>Striped Angel</strong> – When it sees someone in trouble, it always wants to help. It heals Tete up from a distance.</li></ul><p><strong>Collect and Strategize</strong></p><p>After the monsters’ attack is over, you can shop with the gold you found. You can get new plushies and even buy special items that can make you stronger. Some of them will also give you new weaknesses, so it’s up to you to strategize and prepare for the next attack in the best way possible. There are more than 100 items in the game… Will you be able to collect them all?</p><p><strong>Change Clothes to Change Strategies</strong></p><p>So, you’ve played the game’s story to the end. Well done. But this is just the start!</p><p>You can change Tete’s clothes, choosing from more than 20 costumes. Each one makes him stronger in some ways and weaker in others. If you want to help Tete defeat his nightmares, you’ll have to find the right plushies and items to go with each costume!</p><ul><li><strong>Moonlight Wizard</strong> – Plushies with long-range attacks become stronger, but Tete can only use those. Defending yourself becomes harder, so you’ll have to defeat monsters before they can get close.</li><li><strong>Nap Cloud</strong> – Increasing attack power becomes difficult, but plushies that don’t move around attack twice as fast. Try to find as many stationary friends as you can.</li><li><strong>Doggy Friend</strong> – Tete can only use dog plushies. If you want to win, you’ll need to make good use of their fast respawn speed.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/reverie-in-the-moonlight-launches-november-25]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>November 9, 2025 marks the 15-year anniversary of Call of Duty: Black Ops' release. Below, we look at how it departed from previous Call of Duty campaigns and defined developer Treyarch’s contributions to the franchise going forward.</em></p><p dir="ltr">During the infancy of Activision's Call of Duty franchise, Treyarch was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/19/the-other-call-of-duty" rel="nofollow ">the other Call of Duty studio</a>. Comparisons between Treyarch and series creator Infinity Ward were common on internet forums, and a general sentiment among fans and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-partners-boss-acti-has-blown-up-infinity-wards-talent-ea-in-this-game-to-win" rel="nofollow ">even some industry figures</a> was that the former was the franchise's "B-team."</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's 2006 game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-3-review/1900-6161282/">Call of Duty 3</a> was a competent World War II shooter, but it was quickly overshadowed the following year by Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare--a downright revolutionary game that set a new standard for first-person shooter campaigns and online multiplayer modes. Treyarch's subsequent game, 2008's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review/1900-6201010/">World at War</a>, threw the series back in time and mostly played like a World War II re-skin of Modern Warfare.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2010, Treyarch made a sharp turn with Call of Duty: Black Ops, shifting the studio--and the franchise as a whole--toward an entirely new direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598898"></a><figcaption>The twisty story of Call of Duty: Black Ops jumped between different points of time and perspectives.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the first time, Call of Duty ventured into a new historical period, with the Cold War era offering Treyarch several thematic and storytelling opportunities to explore. Rather than telling another boots-on-the-ground story of soldiers in the trenches, Treyarch opted to craft a complex espionage thriller, breaking conventions that previous games in the series established.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the usual passive and silent protagonists in Call of Duty, Black Ops' Alex Mason was fully voiced, and the campaign centered entirely on his personal journey. Mason faced Fidel Castro and John F. Kennedy--unusual for the series at that point, which avoided depicting real-life historical figures.</p><p dir="ltr">The bulk of the nonlinear story of Black Ops (which is technically a World at War sequel) focuses on Mason attempting to piece together his scattered memories, a result of brainwashing by the game's villains. We see his distorted perspective on events, placing us in the role of an unreliable protagonist, and it's unclear through his eyes what's real and what isn't--for once in Call of Duty, we as the player question the reality of what we see through the main character's eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">As GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-review/1900-6283818/">Black Ops review</a> described, "The blurry edges of your consciousness conceal information that must come to light, and the erratic visual effects and eerie audio echoes that accompany your interrogations sometimes bleed into your mission memories, which creates a great tone of uncertainty that plays out in surprising and satisfying ways."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598896"></a><figcaption>One noteworthy new setting that Black Ops brought to Call of Duty was the jungles of Vietnam.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The narrative shifts between different characters, taking us through sequences like a bloody prison break from a gulag and brutal missions in the jungles of Vietnam, weaving an intricate story of paranoia and political intrigue. Plot twists are abundant, and all threads eventually converge for an explosive finale.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops takes the Michael Bay action movie sensibilities of Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare campaigns while fitting them into the molds of political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate. Previous Call of Duty games drew clear visual inspirations from World War II movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates. Similarly, Black Ops took notes from Vietnam War films, including Apocalypse Now and Platoon, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIa2OEmb0v0">one sequence essentially lifting</a> the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCW9NsrV6VM">Russian roulette scene from The Deer Hunter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite its setting and the incorporation of real-life figures, Black Ops lacks a meaningful message about Cold War politics. It offers no critiques or insight on the powerful people pulling the strings--John F. Kennedy is just the guy who gives you your mission, and Fidel Castro is a "bad guy" for you to kill. And the story doesn't engage with the atrocities of the Vietnam War--instead, the Vietnam setting is just another opportunity for you to shoot nameless expendables.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598895" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598895"></a><figcaption>Despite including President John F. Kennedy as a character, Black Ops has nothing to say about him or any real-life politicians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The campaign, which includes story contributions from The Dark Knight writer David S. Goyer, is filled with gratuitous violence, over-the-top slow-motion action, and idiotic clichéd moments like a character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fCv475ilw">dramatically donning his sunglasses indoors</a> before an electric guitar riff plays. It is ultimately a thrilling theme park ride themed on the 1960s, with historical figures as its animatronic figures to sell the illusion.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, the Black Ops campaign was a bold shift for Treyarch and the Call of Duty series. While Infinity Ward and fellow Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games have jumped around different subseries and stories within the franchise, Treyarch has stuck to the Black Ops storyline ever since, launching its seventh Black Ops entry this month.</p><p dir="ltr">With each subsequent Black Ops game, Treyarch doubled down on the twist-filled and complex nature of its narratives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review/1900-6416302/">Black Ops 3 in particular went off the deep end</a>, with an incomprehensible story involving cybernetic neural interfaces and nanotechnology. With 2020's Black Ops Cold War, the subseries returned to its roots, featuring a back-to-basics espionage thriller story that involved brainwashing and a brief appearance by Ronald Reagan. And now with Black Ops 7, the series is heading back to the far-flung future for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6466256/">campaign full of trippy, mind-bending visuals</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I haven't even gotten a moment to touch on Black Ops' multiplayer modes, which were chock-full of fun new features like the top-down Smash TV-inspired Dead Ops Arcade, the franchise's first theater mode, customizable emblems and weapons (novelties that disappeared in future installments), and compelling Wager Matches with modes like One in the Chamber and Gun Game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598894" data-ratio="0.551" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598894"></a><figcaption>The Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops took players to locales as far as the moon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whereas Treyarch used to build on Infinity Ward's work, the other Call of Duty studios have since taken cues from Treyarch's work on Black Ops. By expanding on the Zombies mode from World at War for Black Ops, Treyarch established the Easter egg-filled cooperative mode as an essential third pillar for Call of Duty moving forward, even being included in non-Treyarch entries like Infinite Warfare, WWII, and Modern Warfare 3. And in Infinite Warfare, Infinity Ward actually utilized the wall-running and boost-jumping movement system from Black Ops 3, in a rare case of role reversal between Infinity Ward and Treyarch.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Black Ops 1 released during a tumultuous time for the franchise--in between the release of the 2009 blockbuster hit Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fired-infinity-ward-execs-sue-activision/1100-6252851/">Activision dismissed the studio heads of Infinity Ward</a>, leading to litigation and an exodus of employees from the studio. It would take years for Infinity Ward to rebuild, requiring assistance from Sledgehammer Games for Modern Warfare 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-infinity-ward-absorbs-tony-hawk-dev-neversoft/1100-6419405/">absorbing fellow Activision studio Neversoft</a> while making Call of Duty: Ghosts. Whether Treyarch aimed to or not, the studio proved with Black Ops that it could fill the void left by Infinity Ward, and it’s just as capable of putting out a game-changing entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops will be remembered for bringing us Nuketown, the numbers, and Frank Woods, all permanently etched in the tapestry of Call of Duty's larger history. But more than anything, Black Ops 1 should be admired for throwing more at the wall than any Call of Duty game that would follow.</p>

This will no doubt include keeping certain characters under wraps until the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Well... sadly, it seems someone's let the cat out of the bag a little bit too soon... or should that be the Yoshi out of the bag?</p>
<p>Yes, over on the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">Tops Markets</a> website, the US baking company Pillsbury has uploaded a new product that blatantly shows two images of Yoshi from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. One shows the character taking centre stage on the front of the package with Mario himself striking his best 'Galaxy pose' in the background.</p>
<p>The other is on the back, showing Mario atop Yoshi's back as they soar through space. We also get a glimpse at some of the potential planets from the movie along with what we're assuming is a loose take on Rosalina's Observatory. And is that... Bowser Jr..? Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p>You can check out the images in the embed below, or head on over to the Tops Market website for a look at the original uploads in more detail.</p>

<p>It's also been claimed that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-debut-this-month-its-claimed">trailer for the new movie will be broadcast this month</a> ahead of <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>, with speculation pointing to a potential Direct presentation either on or before 21st November 2025.</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, then we reckon it's a pretty safe bet to say that Yoshi will show up in some capacity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Our first look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie comes from, well, a grocery chain. The film, set to release April 3rd, 2026, has yet to get a full trailer, but the new listing may hint at it coming sooner than we thought.</p>



<p>Illumination and Universal Pictures went big with The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 2022. The first film based on a Nintendo IP in decades, it became the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel was quickly greenlit and, earlier this year, was revealed to be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Story details were thin outside of using Super Mario Galaxy, but we now have some more content from an unlikely source: slice-and-bake cookies.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-look-at-yoshi-and-bowser-jr-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-leaked-online">First Look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Leaked Online</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak comes from an unlikely source: Tops Markets. The East Coast grocery chain put up a new listing for “Pillsbury The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough”. It’s still up, <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">linked here</a>, if you want to look at it, but it’s out of stock. On the box, we have the best look at Yoshi, who is at the end of The Super Mario Bros. Movie via a cracked sewer egg. His design differs a bit from his video-game counterpart with smoother texturing and flatter eyes. </p>



<p>On the back, there’s a fun little maze to fill out. We do get to see some of the worlds Mario and Yoshi will be traveling to, though it’s hard to tell if they come from Super Mario Galaxy or its sequel. However, one icon should be familiar to fans: Bowser Jr.’s graffiti tag. The character, the son of Bowser (played in-film by Jack Black), had yet to be revealed, so his inclusion here is all but confirming his appearance. </p>



<p>A trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to come out soon</a>, possibly with the upcoming Wicked: For Good film. With April 2026 almost here, marketing is set to start and, unfortunately for Nintendo, happened a bit too early. Regardless, we have yet to see Yoshi and Bowser Jr. in action, but it’s good to know some new faces are along for the intergalactic ride.</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshi’s look in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie? Are you going to be picking up the Pillsbury cookies? When do you think the trailer will come out?

            <p>Arc Raiders has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release</a>, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever.</p>

<p>Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">416,517 concurrent users</a> on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">As for why Arc Raiders is so popular</a> when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that "Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has struck down co-op survival horror shooter Misery with a DMCA alleging copyright infringement.</p>
<p>After Valve said it had no option but to take down the game before it too was subject to a copyright claim, the Misery team - chiefly consisting of a solo developer called Maewing - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">claimed</a> it was "under attack!", insisting Misery is "a completely different concept, happening in the fictional Republic of Zaslavie, and it has nothing to do" with GSC's Stalker 2.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the Stalker universe, Chernobyl, etc. Misery uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from their games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed. We also think that this is an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation, and it should not be a thing," the team wrote of its game, which released on Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>"We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP. Of course, Misery was inspired by many things, including games, movies, and books, but filing a DMCA strike for that is wrong. We also want to remind GSC that their games draw heavily from Roadside Picnic and the Stalker movie by Tarkovsky, and they do not own the copyright on depressive Soviet-era buildings, playing guitar, vodka, radiation, or abandoned locations, or even the poo."</p>

<p>As a consequence of the claim, the game has disappeared from the Steam storefront.</p>
<p>"We are 100% sure this misunderstanding will be resolved, Misery will be back on Steam very soon, and we will see many amazing updates and new content," the team added. "This is very unfortunate and painful for us, both mentally and financially, but the development continues, all the updates will be delivered on time, and soon we can play Misery again."</p><p>The message from Valve included screenshots comparing Misery to Stalker 2, including side-by-side comparisons of a gloomy, Soviet-era neightbourhood from Stalker: Call of Prypiat and a similar environment in Misery. Another side-by-side comparison shows characters in both games sitting around a fire wearing gas masks, playing guitar.</p>

<p>The team closed on imploring people not to review-bomb GSC, writing: "do not insult them or other people in comments, especially for their nationality! We do not want or support that".</p>
<p>However, in the privacy of its members-only Discord channel, the developer was considerably less polite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/">and posted a screed of pejorative slurs</a>, prompting a follow-up apology.</p>
<p>"[After the DMCA strike], some people found my old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>). "Many are rightfully upset, and I completely understand why. First of all, I want to acknowledge and take full responsibility for my past words. What I wrote was immature, thoughtless, and wrong. It does not represent who I am today or what I believe in, and I deeply regret posting it.</p><p>"I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds. As for the DMCA strike we will handle it calmly and professionally. There is no basis for it, and I believe Valve will review the situation fairly."</p>
<p>Since then, Reddit investigators believe they've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nnu3vzk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">found unsubstantiated evidence that assets from Stalker 2 were indeed used to create Misery</a>, which may be why GSC has cracked down particularly on this developer and not other copycat titles. Others purport it may be because the developer, and seemingly some elements of the game's fanbase, allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or7deo/few_screenshots_from_the_misery_discord/?share_id=4SZ6WdPDMY2KDFHNmrF88&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">supports</a> Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">GSC is a Ukranian studio</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">GSC Game World announced its plans for updates to Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl for the remainder of 2025</a>. Big ticket updates include tweaks and changes to the A-Life system, Unreal Engine 5 performance gains, and new night vision devices to play with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="935049b296b1e"><a title="Samus and Kandeda - the Akira Slide" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/935049b296b1e/samus-and-kandeda-the-akira-slide.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The cultural consciousness loves the ‘Akira Slide’; a single moment in the 1988 anime movie <strong>Akira</strong> where Shōtarō Kaneda, following a bike race, skids across the tarmac to slow himself down, facing the screen, his bike side-on, trails of smoke billowing up from the road. Of course, he <em>could</em> use his brakes, but it wouldn’t be as flashy now, would it? Distributors Toho knew what they were doing when they slapped Kaneda and the bike on the movie poster.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve never seen the movie, you’ve almost definitely seen the physics-defying Akira Slide. 37 years later, TV showrunners, animators, and directors can’t get enough of that effortless skid. It’s featured in everything from <strong>Batman: The Animated Series</strong> to <strong>Adventure Time</strong> to Jordan Peele’s 2022 sci-fi horror <strong>Nope</strong> to even adorable shows like <strong>Doraemon</strong> and the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime.</p>
<p>And of course, Shadow the Hedgehog even got his own chance to do it in the <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong> movie last year.</p>

<p>It’s natural, then, that video games equally fell in love with this seconds-spanning moment. The latest example sees space bounty hunter and all-around badass Samus Aran in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, riding Vi-O-La and braking in the exact same motion as Kaneda nearly four decades ago (actually more than that if you count the 1982 manga, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2626551-akira-slide">where it’s a lot more low-key</a>).</p>
<p>Somehow, I’d convinced myself that Samus had <em>already</em> done the Akira Slide; Vi-O-La was revealed way back in September, and she’s never had a motorbike before. What better way to introduce her fancy new gear than by doing something flashy with it? Yet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4s-sweet-new-trailer-builds-the-hype-for-next-months-launch">this week’s ‘Survive’ trailer</a> (below) is the first time she’s done this.</p>
<p>From what we know about Prime 4, Samus is on a planet called Viewros, and she’s trying to escape. This trailer pits her against many unfamiliar creatures, aliens, and hulking foes, many of which are new to the Metroid series. And she’s ‘surviving’.</p>

<p>Actually, she looks like she’s kicking butt. Her Akira Slide towards the end, right before Sylux makes an appearance, establishes that. Samus is powerful. And while she might be caught out by Sylux’s entrance (at least, the reaction appears to be part of the same scene), she’s still largely in control. The shot frames her as ready to take action.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to deny that Samus is cool; she’s an icon in Nintendo’s storied history <em>and</em> an important female character and role model for girls, women, <em>anyone</em>. But Metroid is a series that I don’t define for its ‘coolness’. Yes, the power-ups and the upgrades offer a power fantasy that builds over the course of the game. But Metroid is the atmosphere, first and foremost. Even the Prime games.</p>

<p>They’re also pretty damn scary at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> has some unsettling moments even outside of the stressful E.M.M.I. sequences. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> will forever be one of my favourite games because of the creepy hallways of Brinstar and Norfair, of watching Crocomire’s skin melt off in the lava and then getting jumpscared by the skeleton as it attempts to take your life one last time. Or Mother Brain not just being a brain, but some cybernetic alien dinosaur that very almost <em>does</em> kill you. And don’t even get me started on the Chozo Ghosts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Prime</a>. Samus needs those moments of cool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Akira scared me as a kid; it’s still unsettling today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metroid’s Akira Slide is actually the perfect comparison point to the original. Because, like Metroid, Akira’s ‘coolness’ isn’t the thing that sticks with me. The Akira Slide is simply one cool moment that takes place in the first five minutes of the movie, a film full of grotesque imagery, horrifying corruption, and child experiments, and (admittedly) a lot of cool moments.</p>
<p>What I remember is the cyberpunk scenery and atmosphere soaked in rust and neon and petrol, the biker gangs and violence, and the quite-honestly-terrifying body horror sequences towards the end. Akira scared me as a kid; it’s still unsettling today.</p>
<p>But the slide is important, because Kaneda is establishing himself in the movie; he <em>is</em> the one to beat, he <em>is</em> the 'hero', he <em>is</em> the character we’ll see the world through.</p>
<p>It also sets up tonal expectations that are later dashed. Is this a cool action movie? Sometimes! Will there be body horror? At this point, you have no idea. It pairs perfectly with Samus’ own power-versus-the-unknown.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b88c566a72bd4"><a title="No More Heroes 3 Key Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b88c566a72bd4/no-more-heroes-3-key-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This looks familiar! — <em><span></span> Image: Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the time, though, the slide isn’t used in that way. Suda51's <strong>No More Heroes</strong> isn’t exactly known for subtlety, so when it slapped an <a href="https://youtu.be/g2nPg42xsXg?si=HJv09pA7jWj0nHZk&amp;t=300">Akira Slide at the end of a trailer for a fake TV show</a> promoting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_more_heroes_iii">No More Heroes III</a>, I wasn’t surprised. The whole point of these games is the ultraviolence, the silliness, the meta and pop culture references, the ‘coolness’ of them. Travis Touchdown also does the Akira Slide at the end of every Bike Mission.</p>
<p>But the world of No More Heroes is pretty messed up; in the third game, mega corporations build entire islands and murderous aliens create fake, murderous competitions based around becoming a superhero. We need that goofiness, that silliness, and those moments of coolness.</p>
<p>Square Enix also couldn’t help (be careful of spoilers here) <a href="https://youtu.be/-h3FewwJibU?si=vUemzZV8DKzb88Bf&amp;t=1314">putting the slide in</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, too, another game where light relief is always welcome. I won’t talk about it here, but the bike sequence from the original is a little more fleshed-out here with higher stakes. Cloud also <em>thinks</em> he’s cool, but my favourite defining trait of his? He’s actually a bit of a doofus, and that’s emphasised in Rebirth more. We’ll let him have the slide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, obviously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzNCGrlDCAA">had to have the famous slide in it</a>, and it’s one of the ones you can actually do, too; V can bring their motorbike to a stop by angling it <em>just</em> right. Again, who needs brakes? Cyberpunk is one gigantic homage to the genre, so as one of the defining 'things' of anime cyberpunk, this was mandatory.</p>
<p>It’s also the only way any of us will be able to do the Akira Slide without causing a traffic accident in real life.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8d87bda862042"><a title="Cyberpunk 2077 Yaiba Kusanagi CT-3X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d87bda862042/cyberpunk-2077-yaiba-kusanagi-ct-3x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A reference to Ghost in the Shell <em>and</em> Akira? C'mon, CD Projekt Red! — <em><span></span> Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBl5_2bzVp0">character introductions in fighting games</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter VI</a>) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSLSkPzXdwo">skidding on ink</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, the Akira Slide never fails to impress. Even when it’s not used in the exact same way as the original movie. It’s just a very smooth, stylish action that makes you look pretty darn smokin’</p>
<p>But it does go beyond coolness. Amidst chaos, amidst despair, and amidst the horrors of space, the Akira Slide is there to remind you that this character means business; they're a rebel with a cause, establishing their power or dominance in a single moment, like the modern-day (or futuristic) equivalent of drawing your sword at the start of a battle, or making eye-contact during a duel.</p>
<p>Nothing will stop anyone from making sure you — and your enemies — know who's in charge. Not even the laws of physics.</p>

<p>Give Chun-Li and Ken a new look</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the arrival of Chun-Li in the SNK title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/fatal_fury_city_of_the_wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a> earlier this week, Capcom has released some free "special EX" colours for the same character (and the previous CotW DLC character, Ken) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>This will change the colours of Outfit 1 on both characters. You can redeem these colours from the game's 'News' section in the 'Notices' menu and no code input is required. Here's a look:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Chun-Li's kicking into Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves! Celebrate her arrival with free special EX colors for Chun-Li and Ken's Outfit 1!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Although Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves isn't available on the Switch 2, if you want a slice of SNK action, you can always check out the Terry and Mai DLC in Street Fighter 6, or perhaps even some of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">SNK's past releases</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s not often that a band returns to soundtrack the same game nine years after its release — then again, most games aren’t <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. Once demoed on <em>The Tonight Show</em> with Jimmy Fallon and at splashy E3 press conferences, in 2016, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> was heralded as gaming’s future. And it was all made possible by the procedural generation that spawned its vast, sci-fi universe.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, as post-rock band 65daysofstatic returns to re-score the ever-evolving game, generated content is no longer the exciting futurism it once seemed. With AI slop flooding social media and AI-generated bands sneaking their way onto Spotify, the tech that once powered gaming dreams is slowly becoming a dystopian nightmare.</p><p>“It’s just capitalism, isn’t it?” says 65daysofstatic’s Paul Wolinski. “It’s ruining everything. It’s all these CEOs who don’t understand the difference between art and content.”</p><p>That’s where <em>Journeys</em>, a defiantly human soundtrack that stands firmly against the rise of the music-generating machines, comes in. Working alongside Hello Games’ audio director, Paul Weir, Wolinski has spent the last year transforming a series of abstract, unreleased soundscapes into full-fledged songs. Once intended as pieces to be infinitely reassembled by <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s algorithm, the two Pauls strove to reimagine these ethereal bleeps and bloops into something that sounded altogether more human. The result is a 32-track, four-LP album that combines 65daysofstatic’s reworked soundscapes with original compositions from Weir.</p><p>“For this record, we were much more interested in turning all of that infinite stuff into something more intentional — something bespoke and artisan,” says Wolinski. Where the initial soundtrack <em>Music for an Infinite Universe</em>’s pounding drums and swelling guitars match the highs and lows of jetting off into space, <em>Journeys</em> is an altogether eerier creation, channeling the quiet sense of foreboding of arriving on an unknown planet, the initial score’s optimism replaced by a more unknowable reality.</p><p>“When we first started this, I assumed it would be just remixing our old selves,” says Wolinski, “but most of the soundscapes didn’t provide an origin point for an actual song at all… It was much harder, more mysterious.” Luckily, 65daysofstatic had an ethereal expert on hand: Weir.</p><div><p>“We were much more interested in turning all of that infinite stuff into something more intentional”</p></div><p>While the band went off experimenting with procedural generation in their audio / visual live shows, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> continued to grow and evolve, and it needed the music to match. “I didn’t want to sound like a fake 65daysofstatic, you know?” says Weir, as he sat at his synth, picking up where the band of static left off. “I’m a sound designer as much as a composer, and so that’s brought in quite a lot of abstraction into some music. There’s a lot of strange noises!”</p><p>As 65daysofstatic’s prog-laden epics combine with Weir’s synth-led ambience, the result is closer to a Philip Glass score than a noise-drenched post-rock record. It’s a marked evolution from what came before, one that matches <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s journey from rocky launch into the sprawling sci-fi epic that it is today. “It’s a funny old relationship,” reflects Weir, on working on the same game for 14 years. ”We’re both constantly going, ‘All right, enough already, time to move on!’ and then simultaneously delighted by its continued strength and success.”</p><p>It’s not just Hello Games who has enjoyed the fruits of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s success. Of 65daysofstatic’s top-played songs on Spotify, nine of them were written for the game. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> songs have become integral parts of 65daysofstatic live sets, these compositions living on outside of the game in a way soundtracks rarely do. “To us, it has always been a 65daysofstatic record as much as the <em>No Man’s Sky</em> score,” says Wolinski. “We’ve been lucky enough to be associated with a few big things in our career, but to be tied to something that has had such a massive cultural impact, it’s just a lovely feeling.”</p><p>Now with <em>Journeys</em> out in the wild, could 65daysofstatic and Weir perform the music live together? “We wouldn’t rule out potentially doing something on the 10th anniversary in some shape or form,” teases Weir.</p><p>Much like the vast transformation <em>No Man’s Sky</em> has undergone since launch, the world’s relationship with technology has completely changed since 2016. When Wolinski first learned about the possibilities of using procedural generation to rearrange music, he tells me it became something of an obsession, inspiring live-coded, improvised audio / visual tours for the band, 2019’s algorithmic album <em>Decomposition Theory</em>, and even a PhD. “<em>No Man’s Sky</em> definitely sent us off in this other direction,” smiles Wolinski. “And I’m really happy that it did.”</p><div><p>“Who cares if computers can make music? That’s not what music is.“</p></div><p>Yet in 2025, Wolinski believes generative tech’s name has been sullied by prompt-based dirge. “We came back to this project being very against the associations between generative systems and AI slop,” says Wolinski. “​​I think there’s a huge difference between that and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s generative systems … Now it’s all about making more content to churn through, just to keep people’s attention for a few seconds. The whole thing is miserable.”</p><p>“With <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, it’s all our music, everything is handcrafted. The computer does not create anything — what it does do is rearrange it,” explains Weir. Despite the clear difference between an algorithm piecing together human-made music and one simply prompting it into existence, with hardworking human artists currently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ai-band-inspired-by-holding-absence-overtakes-them-on-spotify-its-disheartening-its-insulting-its-a-wake-up-call-3896550">fending off impersonation from AI impostors,</a> the Pauls felt compelled to push back against computer-led composition.</p><p><em>Journeys</em>, then, is more than just an album; it’s humans taking a stand against the rise of the musical machines. “Who cares if computers can make music? That’s not what music is,” says Wolinski. “The moving of the speakers to generate sound waves is such a tiny part of what gives music meaning. It’s all about the social relations around [it], the human dialogue between one person and another, even if they never meet. This is what art is — and it’s why generative AI completely misses the point.”</p><p><sup><sub>Journeys<em> is out now on streaming platforms and </em><a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/no-mans-sky-journeys-exclusive-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl"><em>vinyl</em></a><em>.</em></sub></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjQ5Mjg4"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Regan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/816427/no-mans-sky-album-journeys-65daysofstatic]]></content:encoded>

<p>That may not sound like a big deal for most players - there's no danger of it happening to me - but the cap also apparently applies when there's a double XP weekend, with one player reporting you can "hit that cap in just 4-5 hours of playing".</p><p>"In a $70 'AAA' game not a mobile free2play title you're being told how much fun you're allowed to have per day," wrote one player. "This isn't a free live service grindfest. This is a full price shooter with a F2P gacha like system glued on top."</p>

<p>Even those who wouldn't hit the cap do agree with the spirit of the complaint, though.</p>
<p>"I won’t hit an exp cap either because I can only put myself thru 2hrs max.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lieutenant Titus from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> has become one of the most recognizable faces in all Warhammer 40,000 following the enormous success of the video game. We’ve already seen Games Workshop double-down on the Ultramarines hero with merch, an appearance in the Warhammer 40,000 episode of Amazon's animated anthology, Secret Level, and various cameos across the setting. But now things have leveled up — not just for Titus as a Space Marine, but his place in the ongoing Warhammer 40,000 narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Games Workshop unveiled Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, which means Titus has had a much-deserved promotion since the now canon events of Space Marine 2 and Secret Level. Titus is once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game. What does Titus' promotion mean for Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who we see in Space Marine 2? Let’s be real here: he’s probably dead. I guess he couldn’t spare enough men.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Titus, his promotion comes with bigger and tougher responsibilities: he’s been put in charge of defending the Five Hundred Worlds of Ultramar, the realm of Space Marine poster boys, the Ultramarines. With Primarch Roboute Guilliman off gallivanting with his Indomitus Crusade, Titus is now in charge of keeping things safe and sound back home, where new Necron threats have emerged, as they always do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop released a new trailer, below, to hype up this narrative expansion, and it features Titus front and center as he accepts his new job title and what he calls his “impossible mission.” He’s had an eye-catching glow up since we last saw him, and he has a cool new model for use in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game to boot. Titus is joined by friends his fans will know well: Ancient Gadriel from Space Marine 2, and Veteran Sergeant Metaurus from Secret Level (he lives!).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">500 Worlds: Titus is the name for the next major narrative expansion for Warhammer 40,000. According to a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/fm2tm39s/world-championships-preview-captain-titus-battles-nekrosor-ammentar-for-the-five-hundred-worlds-of-ultramar/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, that includes a set of four books that will tell the story of the Ultramarian Reclamation and the embattled Vespator Front, where Titus and the Ultramarines Second Company "are locked in a desperate struggle against a Necron force rife with the Destroyer curse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a big moment for Titus but also the Space Marine video game franchise. It is evidence of the importance of the character to Warhammer 40,000, and the seismic impact Space Marine 2 has had on the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-says-a-large-chunk-of-fans-have-assumptions-about-the-warhammer-40000-universe-that-are-not-correct-as-a-result-of-the-huge-success-of-the-game">Speaking to IGN at gamescom 2025</a>, Tim Willits, development chief at Saber Interactive, said Space Marine 2’s popularity had opened the door to the grimdark Warhammer 40,000 setting for an army of new fans who weren't necessarily clued up about the intricacies of the universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I heard that lots of people now think that Thousand Sons are the only Chaos faction because that's what we had in the game,” Willits said, reflecting on Space Marine 2’s first year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so people are like, ‘Oh, I guess Thousand Sons, they're Chaos.’ It's like, ‘Actually no it's not.’ They're actually just a small faction. But people are just like, ‘That's the one I played against.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This assumption about Chaos extends to the Space Marines themselves. The Ultramaines — the chapter used by Games Workshop itself when introducing newcomers to the tabletop via starter sets — are the protagonists of the Space Marine 2 campaign, although many other factions are available to play as in the PvE and PvP modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“People have assumptions about the Warhammer 40,000 universe that are not correct,” Willits continued. “Like Thousand Sons being the only Chaos faction. That is kind of humorous. And like, ‘Oh Space Marines are only blue!’ That has been quite humorous to be honest, which is good for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions going into the already confirmed Space Marine 3 is whether Saber will venture beyond the Ultramarines and the Thousand Sons in terms of the next campaign. The story seems to set up the addition of the Necrons, which at this point probably wouldn't come as much of a surprise for Space Marine 3. But could other Space Marine chapters also appear? Perhaps other Chaos factions, too? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing"><u>We asked Willits about Space Marine 3, but he remained tight-lipped</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now Titus is firmly back in the fold, we have to wonder, what does the overly suspicious Chaplain Leandros think? He spent pretty much the entirety of Space Marine 2 threatening to end poor Titus at the first sign of corruption, and even after Titus’ heroics, a commendation from Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, and what some think was a word of encouragement from the Emperor himself, Leandros remained unconvinced. If Titus manages to complete this impossible task and defend the 500 worlds, will he finally win Leandros over? Somehow I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way. Assuming Space Marine 3 picks up after the events of 500 Worlds, we may well see Titus lead armies into battle, rather than a single squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>That's according to parent company Kadokawa, which revealed in its latest financials that with Elden Ring Nightreign "performing well beyond initial expectations", we can expect new DLC by the end of this financial year, which is the end of March 2026.</p>

In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window was not been provided.</p>

              <p>Most people assume that they need to spend over a thousand dollars on a MacBook Air to get a decent laptop that will run everyday tasks smoothly. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/">HP 15.6″ laptop flips that assumption on its head by providing solid performance, a generous 16GB of RAM, and a massive 1TB SSD for just $599, down from $2,599</a>. That’s roughly half the price of Apple’s entry-level laptop but with more storage and a bigger screen. Suddenly, this becomes a no-brainer, based on what you actually get for your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Performance That Covers All Your Bases</h2>
<p>The processor at the heart of this HP laptop is an <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 that runs at 1.8GHz, turbocharging at 3.8GHz</strong> when you need it to. This eight-core chip runs multiple browser tabs, video calls, document editing, and media streaming without choking or forcing you to wait. The 6MB cache memory makes it possible for the processor to access data sooner because such data has been previously accessed repeatedly, which means faster performance when switching between applications or loading up programs you use regularly.</p>
<p>That 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes all the difference in the usage of the laptop: The operating systems and web browsers of today are voracious devourers of memory, so with 16GB, you’ll be able to keep dozens of tabs open at the same time, run Microsoft Office apps, stream music, and handle video conferencing-all without lag. The 1TB PCIe SSD provides blazing-fast boot times and application launches while giving you enough room for years of documents, photos, and videos.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touch screen features a 1920 x 1080 resolution for crisp text and detailed images. The IPS panel technology keeps colors accurate and vibrant when you’re looking from an angle, which comes into play when sharing content with others or using the device in different positions. Coming with a screen brightness of 300 nits, you can comfortably use this without squinting at a screen that’s too dimly lit, in well-lit rooms or near windows.</p>
<p>Touch capability brings convenience for those kinds of actions that are just awkward on a trackpad: scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, and navigating <strong>Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface</strong> are all more intuitive when you can simply reach out and touch the screen. The anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from overhead lights and windows to help save your eyes during long work sessions. The <strong>Intel UHD Graphics run video playback and light photo editing with ease</strong>, though you’ll want a dedicated GPU if you’re planning serious gaming or professional video work.</p>
<p>The USB Type-C port transfers data at 5Gbps to let you move large files to external drives in record time. Dual USB Type-A ports accommodate older peripherals-mice, keyboards, and external hard drives that haven’t made the jump to USB-C. An HDMI 1.4b port connects to an external monitor or TV for a dual-screen setup that’s pretty much a productivity necessity. Wi-Fi 6 delivers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks than earlier Wi-Fi standards, while Bluetooth 5.4 connects your wireless headphones, mice, and other accessories with improved range and stability.</p>
<p>For $599, you’re paying less than a quarter of the original $2,599 price, which is an absurd discount that puts this laptop within reach of buyers who think decent computing power requires a four-figure investment.</p>
