            <guid>1372039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> leads with a lot of messages directly to the player over a shimmering background. In this game, the player is assured, you can be anyone. You can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds great: a promise that many games make, but exceedingly few deliver on. Unfortunately, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is closer to the empty promise of the many than the delivery on the few.</p><h2>Freedom Facade</h2><p>Where this freedom fails is the story that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> attempts to tell. Instead of using the eight protagonists that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-review-road-less-traveled" rel="nofollow">defined the original Octopath</a>, 0 centers your journey around antagonists. Specifically, these antagonists embody the temptations of Fame, Power, and Wealth.</p><p>Gone are the days of small vignettes. Instead, this tale is a continent-spanning epic about warring kingdoms. The bigger war going on is between the story and the game that’s containing it. Octopath’s structure of chapters that last around an hour or two is perfect for smaller-scale stories, as a few bite-sized, self-contained stories lead to a climactic conclusion.</p><p>On the other hand, this longer-form story struggles. It cycles through a seemingly endless supply of new characters, nearly all of whom are one of two absolutes: “I am a good guy” or “I am a bad guy.” None of them goes through meaningful growth or change.</p><p>During dialogue exchanges your custom character protagonist has with this large cast, you’ll occasionally be prompted to make choices. These choices, a totally new addition to the franchise, are also a superfluous one. Every time you make a choice, there is a clear “right” and “wrong” answer. If you choose the wrong one, you’re usually just taken back to the dialogue choice. Less <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>, more <em>Pokémon</em>.</p><p>This created protagonist also comes at the cost of the usual octet of heroes on your journey. Where previous games had the heroes’ personalities at the forefront, <em>0 </em>has only your created protagonist with no dialogue. In attempting to create a canvas, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is left with more of a husk.</p><h2>Familiar Feelings</h2><p>Where <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> shines is in the places it borrows from its predecessors. The turn-based battle system is as sharp as ever. Strategizing Boost Points and attack types to Break your opponents is immensely satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>With how balanced the game is around the new, more singular story, the level curve is more direct. Your party members will all begin to have all of their skills unlocked and reach their full potential right at the final showdown. It feels free of level scaling issues that have plagued other entries.</p><p>The biggest change is with the freedom granted by the additional party members. Your battle party consists of eight characters instead of 4. This means that certain party members can take a supporting role in the back row, while a vanguard fights up front. &nbsp;This switch-up refreshed the already top-of-the-class battle system in a very engaging way.</p><p>To support this greater battle, you can get quite a few new heroes in your total ranks. Instead of the usual eight, there are loads of characters to find– my final crew had 15– and it's fun to try out all of the different combinations. You'll find a few favorites: shoutout to Viator, the best tank a guy could ask for. However, changing out your party is a quick menu away.</p><p>This sizable band of heroes comes at the cost of the old skill upgrade style and a new, more rigid system. Like all <em>Octopath </em>games, you gain more agency as time goes on, but it's a long walk. It's a neat change, but I'm hoping not the new normal.</p><p>It also still has the same HD-2D style that the series has become known for. It still has its same perks– gorgeous pop-up book environments, cool enemy battle sprites– and its same drawbacks– lack of character expression, limitations of how varied characters look. It also has the same great soundtrack as the first two games, but it is mostly reused from other games.</p><p>Also returning from the original games is the lengthy endgame. <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is at its best when you can break the battle system, and getting the last tools to do so is always a satisfying feeling.</p><h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game at odds with itself. The game presents a fantasy: you can go anywhere. You can be anyone.</p><p>In reality, every added freedom comes at too high of a cost. There are more party members than ever, but in exchange, you can customize them far less. You create your own protagonist, but in exchange, they have no personality.</p><p>Where the best freedoms of the <em>Octopath Traveler</em> series have always come from have been the way that the eight paths and eight protagonists intersect. You mix and match their jobs. You sequence break their chapters to wander into higher-level locations than you should be and challenge yourself.</p><p>In breaking these sorts of norms, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> ends up being the most restrictive and weakest entry in the entire franchise. At least now I’m <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-ii-review" rel="nofollow">free to play <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> again</a> instead.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong> was reviewed on Nintendo Switch 2 with a copy provided by the developer over the course of 35 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em><br>&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skyblivion</em>, the ambitious total conversion mod that aims to rebuild <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>'s world of Cyrodiil inside its sequel <em>Skyrim</em>, has once again been delayed, this time to next year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/dev_diary/delay-announcement/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the mod's official website, the <em>Skyblivion </em>team says its goal "since [the mod's] initial announcement" has been to launch in 2025, but that in order to deliver a "polished, stable, and complete experience", <em>Skyblivion </em>must be delayed to 2026.</p><p>Specifically, three areas require additional attention before the mod is complete, namely Imperial City assets and interiors, technical work on NPC and creature functionality (as well as quests), and general polish across the board.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Skyblivion </em>needs a little extra time before it's ready for release.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite the delay, the <em>Skyblivion </em>mod team says it's "closer than ever" to release, and that the mod is currently "in the best state it has ever been", so perhaps we can hope that this will be the final delay for the ambitious project.</p><p>Specifically, the team says the entire world map of <em>Oblivion </em>is "100% complete" in <em>Skyrim</em>, and you can check out an interactive map of the team's work <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a> (although it might be a little slower to load whenever the site is busy, apparently).</p><p>Additionally, all quest dungeons are complete "with unique boss battles and rewards", and the mod's core weapon, armor, and clutter assets are "essentially finished" and sporting "beautiful and unique redesigns".</p><p>You can check out a video that contains a more detailed breakdown of where the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is at, and what needs to be done next, right here.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Skyblivion</em>, it's a total conversion mod that is aiming to reproduce the entirety of <em>Oblivion</em>'s world in <em>Skyrim</em>, complete with the former's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skyblivion-devs-detail-remastered-quests-and-environments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef9bba54-91b5-4661-99d0-8e16492cc51d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">quests</a>, environments, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/biggest-skyblivion-update-shows-world" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="892838a0-bbd2-435a-8df4-97e3eeb52ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">world</a>.</p><p>The mod will be free when it launches, but it will require you to own both <em>Oblivion</em>'s Game of the Year Deluxe edition and <em>Skyrim</em>'s Special Edition, so make sure you've got both of them before you install it (when it releases, of course).</p><p><em>Skyblivion </em>has been in development for a number of years; in the intervening time between its announcement and the present day, Bethesda <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a10701c6-a666-4045-979d-936482373c34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released its own <em>Oblivion </em>remaster</a>, although arguably, what the <em>Skyblivion </em>team is aiming to do is even more ambitious than that.

Truth be told, I have never played a Castlevania game. Just haven't gotten round to one of 'em yet! Symphony of the Night is probably more my speed over the original games, but I do see their importance too of course. However, what I have played, at least a little bit of, is a game that is very derivative of OG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> except for the fact you can see the entire, 8-bit level at once: Schattenjäger.
</p>
<p>
The setup is as simple as many NES games were. You are Gabriel Knight, the titular Schattenjäger, who has received a request from the local townspeople in the dead of night to rescue a woman named Diana from the evil Count (i.e. legally distinct Dracula). You've got a big ole spear, and you can throw some kind of magic glass thing for long distance damage. It's Castlevania! But as I said, rather than scroll bit by bit, you can see the entire level at once.

<p>
At first I wondered what purpose this might serve. Seeing the whole level gives you the advantage that you know what's coming, so you can plot out your next steps. Though, that potentially trivialises some elements of the game. Agh! No! I just got hit by an invisible enemy, and I died. Womp, womp. It's a bit mean spirited, but in that Soulsian kind of way, where you've learned a lesson, a tidbit about the world, and can come back better next time.
</p><p>
Overall it is most definitely more of a technical exercise than a gameplay revolution. There's an emphasis on the novelty of it, the fact that "every pixel is exactly one pixel in full-HD resolution." And yet it doesn't claim to be anything more than it is, it doesn't outstay its welcome, and offers a fun spin on a classic series. Give it a punt on <a href="https://tim-rachor.itch.io/schattenjaeger">itch.io</a>, it can even run in your browser.

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Eidos Montreal Was Working on a Legacy of Kain Reboot Before Embracer Buyout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/</link>
            <guid>1372021</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<div><p>Several CVs from past employees at Eidos Montreal have revealed that the developer was working on a ‘Dark Fantasy ARPG’ and was focused on reviving an established vampire IP, with a design emphasis on melee combat and parkour. The details have sparked a lot of speculation online, but Insider Gaming can confirm that it was a Legacy of Kain reboot and that its cancellation is a few years old at this point.</p><p>To make it clear, the current set of cancelled projects circulating around is years old and is not a part of the current layoffs.</p></div>







<p>The project was cancelled following Embracer’s acquisition of the studio, which was known internally as P16, as it was the 16th project to start development at Eidos Montreal.</p>



<p>Described to Insider Gaming as a ‘Legacy of Kain soft-reboot’, the game made it only around a year into development before Embracer pulled the plug to send the IP back to Crystal Dynamics. However, it’s currently unknown whether or not Crystal Dynamics did anything with the IP after it was transferred back.</p>



<p>Sources tell Insider Gaming that the project was going well, and despite only around a year of development, there was already some barebones gameplay.</p>



<p>P17 is, unfortunately, just one of many projects cancelled at Eidos Montreal in the last few years (as many as 7-8), with the studio seemingly being forced into a direction of being an outsourcing studio for the likes of Grounded 2 and Fable. Sources tell me that the developers were also previously asked to work on Kojima’s Overdose, but the request was refused because some of its developers would have had to move to Japan.</p>







<p>Currently, Eidos Montreal is also working on its own massive internal project, which started development around 2019 and has seen hundreds of millions of dollars pumped into it – a cost that sources say will unlikely to be recouped – but too much investment has already been made for it to be cancelled.</p>



<p>As for what this eventually means for Eidos Montreal is unclear, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs earlier this year</a> and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other subsequent rounds of layoffs</a> could mean that the future is dire for the studio. </p>



<p>If you’re a developer at Eidos Montreal and would like to speak further on the issues at the studio, you can email me securely and anonymously at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="02766d6f766d6f6a676c666770716d6c4272706d766d6c6f636b6e2c616d6f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios are preparing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players for Season 1: Winter Offensive with a community letter with a list of changes set to be introduced with the upcoming 1.1.3.0 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message, which aims to roll out the welcome mat for what will be yet another feedback-driven update, was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-incoming-winter-offensive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on the official Battlefield 6 website</u></a> today. It comes with a breakdown for some of the community talking points BF Studios has attempted to address so far, while giving fans a closer look at what’s to come when Winter Offensive launches December 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-anticheat-update-season-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anticheat</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">challenge/progression</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-surprise-update-addresses-escalation-feedback-with-increased-objective-capture-time">Escalation</a> updates topping the list of recent highlights, BF Studios is turning its attention to a number of key issues across combat, REDSEC, and the overall Battlefield 6 experience. One especially troublesome issue for the community that the team is seeking to fix with update 1.1.3.0 are audio issues that have existed since launch. Players should notice, for example, that footsteps have been tweaked to “improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have also continued to work on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds,” BF Studios says, “such as vehicles or footsteps, to sometimes not play as intended, which has been particularly noticeable on larger Battle Royale maps.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following last month’s multiplayer mode tweaks is a set of additional adjustments for Rush and Breakthrough. The studio explains the new changes as another step in the balancing act that has seen it attempting to keep matches fair, with the new update ideally improving the experience for attacking players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capture volumes and vehicle availability in Breakthrough will also be updated when 1.1.3.0 launches next week, with BF Studios explaining that Siege of Cairo, for example, will feature an additional attacker tank for Sectors 1 and 3 and a reworked capture area for objective B. Rush fans will notice M-COM locations for Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak have been adjusted to further refine attacker gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These updates are intended to reduce bottlenecks, remove frustration points, and create more consistent and engaging fights around objectives,” BF Studios says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Beyond these highlights, we have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more, which you will see detailed in the full notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another topic plaguing the Battlefield 6 fanbase since launch involves potential hit registration and netcode issues. It’s an area BF Studios has taken aim at before, with update 1.1.3.0 set to, hopefully, buff out even more scratches related to inconsistent gameplay across multiplayer and REDSEC. Also included in the new changes is the promise that Battlefield 6 will be easier on the eyes thanks to changes to close-range soldier visibility, lighting, prone animations, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players across the experience will likely pick up on “wide-ranging” changes to weapon handling, attachments, and recoil patterns, REDSEC fans can look forward to armor and tank availability changes. Armor changes for the battle royale experience will be detailed in its own dedicated post in the near future, with tank changes also subject to change as fans get their hands on update 1.1.3.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are actively exploring several areas aimed at improving clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat, BF Studios adds. “This includes further work on edge cases related to hit registration, investigating rare desync scenarios with destructible objects, and gathering deeper data on situations where players feel they were eliminated after reaching cover. These areas remain key priorities, and the findings from our ongoing investigations will inform updates planned for the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest communication from the Battlefield team stops short of providing full Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. Players are told to expect a more detailed list of all of the new weapon, map, and mode changes in “the next few days.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 Season 1 will deliver its third and final chapter when Winter Offensive launches December 9 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. While the two previous chapters have introduced additional weapons, modes, and two maps – Blackwell Fields and Eastwood – next week’s content update focuses on its Ice Lock event changes. Expect snowy limited-time goodies for Gauntlet and Empire State, as well as an ice climbing axe melee weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles October 10.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175</link>
            <guid>1371994</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>No Games For Genocide, a collective of video game workers and union organizers, just announced a pledge to boycott Xbox. It calls on journalists, developers, streamers, and consumers to participate in the Palestinian-led BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement against Microsoft, which it’s accused of being complicit in Israeli war crimes. The tech giant recently cut off cloud services to an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>used them for mass surveillance of Palestinians</span></a><span>, but continues supplying them to the rest of the military.</span></p> <p><span>After years of acquisitions, Microsoft has become a gaming industry monolith, and avoiding it entirely may prove difficult for many, especially considering how dire the industry’s job crisis has been over the last few years. But </span><a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/"><span>No Games For Genocide</span></a><span> believes that the more people who take part in their movement’s proposed collective actions, the better chance the tech giant will take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The games industry in particular is at the intersection of entertainment and tech, and there are a lot of material links—when we’re looking at the tech aspect of hardware and software—there are a lot of connections between the games industry and the genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,” Sara Khan, a content creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gameassist"><span>cofounder of Game Assist</span></a><span>, and one of No Games For Genocide’s organizers, told me over a video call. “A few of us really wanted to organize around that, and organize people within the industry to say ‘we don’t want these ties’ and find a way to move past them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and IWGB Game Workers Union founder, Austin Kelmore, worked with other industry members to organize No Games For Genocide and determine where to focus its attention. The IWGB recently unionized Disco Elysium maker ZA/UM and has been fighting Rockstar Games over the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478"><span>firing of 34 </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> developers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Sort of serendipitously, the </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft"><span>Palestinian-led BDS movement</span></a><span> announced earlier this year that Xbox was going to be one of their new consumer targets,” Khan explained.” It made sense for it to be a priority campaign for us.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6zcsllmoc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreielby3tqjwmmgrdbdifrubaewzhyln7onkchbyj6t7wx4skskvbtm"> <p lang="en">SIGN OUR BOYCOTT XBOX PLEDGE: We are asking gamers, game workers, streamers &amp; journalists to join us in boycotting &amp; divesting from Xbox, to force Microsoft to end its complicity in the genocide of Palestinians.</p> <p>We’ve provided concrete actions everyone can take. Sign here: nogamesforgenocide.com</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn?ref_src=embed">No Games For Genocide (@nogamesforgenocide.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/post/3m6zcsllmoc2k?ref_src=embed">2025-12-02T16:00:16.473Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>No Games For Genocide has been working with the BDS National Committee to organize its campaign, which doesn’t just include signing the pledge, but offers a variety of other ways people can participate. </span></p>

 <p><span>It argues that consumers should avoid purchasing Microsoft or Xbox products, streamers shouldn’t play Xbox-published games on stream (or accept sponsorships from any Xbox game studio), journalists should “halt all coverage of Xbox-published games,” and developers should “demand [their] publisher not publish [their] game on the Xbox and Microsoft Stores,” among other things.</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and their fellow organizers know these are some pretty tall orders. “People understandably are facing hurdles and have to consider the potential risks to their job security, their livelihood, which is completely understandable,” they said. “This is definitely more long-term work. How do we build that collective power? How do we make sure we’re protecting people’s jobs and accounting for that risk? […] As individuals, these things are scary; the risks that they carry are very real, so it’s important for us to build that collective power.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps with that risk in mind, many of the pledge’s signatories (which include the investigative YouTube channel People Make Games and worker-owned game studio Soft, Not Weak) are at the consumer level. “That’s immediately more accessible to folks,” Khan explained. “Hopefully, over time, we’d love to be able to get more studios or media outlets in a position to commit to the pledge.”</span></p> <p><span>The term “collective power” comes up a lot; the notion that organizing behind a common goal can create cover and/or protection for individuals who want to publicly take a political position that may result in retaliation. Khan likened it to union organizing and how workers feel empowered to stand up for fair wages and labor protections together as a unit: “How can we build towards you being in a position—not just you as an individual in your workplace, but hopefully multiple individuals, perhaps the entire workplace—to get you into a position where this would be doable? […] There is only so much we can do as individuals. There’s so much more we can do as a collective.”</span></p> <p><span>But didn’t Israel and Palestine just agree on a ceasefire? And what about the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">September 2025 “update” from Microsoft</a> that confirmed the company “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense?” When asked, Khan pointed back to the</span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians"><span> official BDS statement</span></a><span> after </span><span>Microsoft announced it was terminating Israel’s access to AI and Azure cloud tech</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><span>Microsoft remains a key technological pillar in Israel’s apartheid regime and its genocide in Gaza,” the BDS news post read. “It continues to equip the Israeli military, government, and prisons with the technology used to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Khan also emphasized that Microsoft and other video game companies are complicit in the genocide and imperialism taking place in the global south, and that No Games For Genocide’s goal is to help the industry rethink its role in these systems. (In 2023, a</span><a href="https://google.com/search?q=future+class+kotkau&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=future+class+kotkau&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBggGECEYCtIBCDQ1OTVqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span> petition created by the Game Awards Future Class calling on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Gaza</span></a><span> was reportedly ignored.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The violence that Palestinian people have been experiencing is, plain and simple, settler colonial violence,” Khan said. “It’s an occupation, not just apartheid and not just genocide…so a ceasefire is not enough. We have to question the very existence of a settler colonial state, and we have to ask: What does decolonization look like for the Palestinian people?”</span></p> <p><span>No Games For Genocide’s long-term goals are aligned with BDS: “We keep mounting up the pressure until we see Microsoft divesting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotaku has reached out to Xbox for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

		<p>KING Art and Deep Silver have announced that a second closed alpha playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV will be taking place next week, with the confirmed dates being December 12th to December 15th. Those who took part in the November closed playtest will automatically be enrolled and emails will be sent on how to join. Those who did not take part in the Novmber closed playtest for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV need to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/gb/games/dawn-of-war-iv#newsletter">Dawn of War IV newsletter</a> as information on how to take part will be sent through that.</p>

<p>In a statement the developers said, <em>“While this next round of testing will remain relatively small in size, we’re looking to bring on some new testers alongside our existing group of Closed Alpha Testers to provide feedback on the game as we work to shape the future of Dawn of War IV together. <wbr>As a reminder, these tests utilize an early Alpha Build of the game, with selected testers being required to sign an NDA, as well as agree not to share, discuss, screenshot, or record any part of the test. Additionally, if you don’t already have one, you’ll need to create a free Discord account if selected.”</em></p>
<p>Only a select few new closed alpha playtesters will be selected for this round of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV playtest, as it will remain small in scale. Future playtests will expand the content available and allow more players to join. When it releases, the game will have over 70 campaign missions which can be played solo or in co-op, and the four factions will include the Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

		<p>Tribute Games has released the first big patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, with the main focus by the team being removing bugs from the game. Some of the fixes in this patch for Marvel Cosmic Invasion include addressing an issue causing the game to crash when joining multiplayer sessions, an issue where Super Heroes stats would not upgrade, and also making sure Master Mold is no longer invulnerable. You can read the full list of fixes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p><b>Fixes!</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heteropteron Blocker&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where having camera shake effects OFF would stop the cinematic from triggering, keeping Super Heroes trapped in Stage 13<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Crashing</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where joining a multi-player game session and resetting story progress would trigger a crash<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Cheating!&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue where Master Mold would become invulnerable and non-targetable, which if anything was just rude<wbr></li>
<li><b>Venom Issues</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed issues where Venom could become frozen after being parried during Symbiote Pounce or immediately lose armor during Venom Bite<wbr></li>
<li><b>Upgrade Blocking&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue that would mean Super Heroes’ stats did not upgrade after levelling up unless players returned to the main menu.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Enemy Superpowers</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where enemies would deal abnormally high damage on their first hit during a grab<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Invulnerability&nbsp;</b>– We’ve fixed an issue (and related issues) where Annihilus wouldn’t re-enter the staggered/vulnerable state and players couldn’t deal damage<wbr></li>
<li><b>Where’s Hela?!&nbsp;</b>– Fixed an issue where Hela could de-synchronise while teleporting<wbr></li>
<li><b>Annihilus Forever!&nbsp;</b>– We fixed an issue where Annihilus wouldn’t stop attacking after his shield breaks<wbr></li>
<li><b>Multiplayer Connections</b>&nbsp;– Fixed an issue which could cause problems when the host disconnects while Super Heroes are joining a lobby (this should now simply return you to the multiplayer menu)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reigning in She-Hulk</b>&nbsp;– Option now added to have controller shake only for players controlling the character (meaning that She-Hulk’s controller vibration only happens for the player controlling her)<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Hold On What?!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue where Super Heroes would sometimes be swapped when respawning<wbr></li>
<li><b>At Least Credit Me&nbsp;</b>– The character who threw the enemy will now be considered the instigator when determining who gets credit for knocking down an assembly line bomb<wbr></li>
<li><b>Cosmic Stability</b>&nbsp;– We’ve deployed some additional protection for lobby stability when players reach Game Over in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Interrogating the Vampire</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed an issue which prevented Super Heroes from using the Vampire modifier in Arcade Mode<wbr></li>
<li><b>Choose your character!</b>&nbsp;– We’ve fixed the issue with the characters’ order in character select for Steam Deck and Linux. That should fix the online desync/crashs between Steam Deck and other versions<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Smaller Fixes</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where intro music was used instead of main stage music where players joined later in Stage 2 (Genosha)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed MODOK’s movement and behaviours (quite a lot of fixes here, actually)<wbr></li>
<li>Tweaked Beta Ray Bill’s no-hammer attack to ensure it doesn’t register as a multi attack<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some enemies would do multiple hits instead of the expected one hit attack<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where enemies would walk without actually moving<wbr></li>

<p>In our Marvel Cosmic Invasion review, Ade said,<em> “Having found Tribute Games’ previous release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, to be one of the best scrolling beat ‘em ups I’d ever played, I had high expectations for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. How could Shredder’s Revenge with Marvel characters go wrong? Sadly, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is entirely OK but fails to be anything more than that.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreig</em>n’s first paid DLC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>The Forsaken Hollow</em></a>, is finally here. If it does it’s job, the new mini-expansion will bring fans back and give them new reasons to obsess over the surprisingly excellent multiplayer roguelike.</p> <p>I’ve cleared my schedule and shamed my friends into joining me for whatever fresh surprises from FromSoftware await us. Here’s everything you need to know about the new content, including what’s in it, when it goes live, and the accompanying patch notes.</p>

 <h2 id="what-time-does-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-launch-in-your-time-zone">What time does <em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</em> go live?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official release schedule of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows is now available.</p> <p>Learn how to access the content of The Forsaken Hollows here: <a href="https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1">https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJafPEq0dV">pic.twitter.com/RJafPEq0dV</a></p> <p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1995858043746275502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is the part that sucks. The global release times are staggered and consoles get the short end of the stick. <em>The Forsaken Hollow</em> launches December 3 at 6:00 p.m. ET on PC and December 4 at 12:00 a.m. ET. If you’re on Xbox Series X/S, you can pull the time zone trick to get in early, but it seems like everyone on PlayStation 5 and PS4 are out of luck.</p>

 <p>I’m still holding out some small ray of hope that the DLC will magically unlock around 9:00 p.m. ET like most of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s free updates and weekly content rotations. That doesn’t seem to be the care this time around, however.</p>

 <h2>How do you access <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>?</h2> <p>Just because you bought the $15 DLC doesn’t mean the content will automatically be active in your version of <em>Nightreign</em>. To actually access the two additional Nightfarer characters you’ll need to have first defeated Tricephalos, the game’s three-headed wolf Nightlord. After that, head to the Roundtable Hold, talk to the Iron Menial, and get the message from the Small Jar Merchant to unlock the new Scholar and Undertaker classes.</p>

 <p>What about the new Shifting Earth event? To access that and the new Balancers boss fight, you’ll need to have completed the above steps and defeated a second Nightlord. With those conditions met you’ll head to a chapel that appears behind the Small Jar Merchant where you can activate the&nbsp;cataclysmic Shifting Earth event ‘The Great Hollows.’</p>

 <h2>What’s <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC adding to <em>Nightreign</em>?</h2> <p>There’s the Scholar, a new support class whose Character Skill is called Analyze and lets him debuff enemies by keeping them within a scoped view. His passive skill is Bagcraft which lets him hold more items. His Ultimate Art is called Communion and it links enemies so damaging one damages them all, while also doing the same for allies letting them share heals.</p>

 <p>Then there’s Undertaker, a more aggressive melee class whose Character Skill is called Trance and gives her free stamina and bonus speed. Her Ultimate Art is Loathsome Hex which unleashes a flurry of attacks at whatever’s targeted. Her passive, Confluence, briefly gives her another free Ultimate Art any time an ally uses theirs.</p> <p><em>The&nbsp;Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC also adds the aforementioned Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, which isn’t just a repurposed section of the existing map but an entirely new area players will have to fly to with its own points of interest, ruins, and underground mazes. In addition to the new Balancers Nightlord, the DLC is bringing poison swamps to Limveld, fresh field bosses, and also entirely new weapons.</p> <p>Most importantly, it should feel hard. “Whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718">director Junya Ishizaki promised</a>. “[<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <h2>A new patch with no Nightfarer balance changes</h2> <p>Finally, the DLC arrives alongside the latest free update which is already live. It includes some small quality-of-life tweaks and a bunch of bug fixes, including for Raider’s Retaliate skill where it wouldn’t work properly and an ongoing issue where some Sites of Grace or Churches wouldn’t activate. Notably, however, there are no actual buffs or nerfs to the existing cast of characters. Maybe FromSoftware wants to see how Scholar and Undertaker compare before decided to rescale them.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103"><em>Nightreign</em> version 1.03</a>:</p> <blockquote> <h2>New features</h2> <ul> <li>Added support for The Forsaken Hollows. <ul> <li>If you own the DLC The Forsaken Hollows, it will be displayed in the lower right corner of the title screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a display of the currently equipped relics in the Character Selection menu. <ul> <li>You can check the effects of equipped relics by toggling the display.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a feature to set names when registering Relics presets in the Relic Rites menu.</li> <li>Set names can be changed in the All Presets section.</li> <li>The order of presets for each character can now be changed in the All Presets section of the Relic Rites menu. <ul> <li>In the Relic Rites menu, you can change the order of presets (but not the order of the character themselves) in the All Relics section.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Deep Large Scenic Flatstone to the Collector Signboard shop.</li> <li>The map’s layer display can now be toggled in the Results menu.</li> <li>The relics equipped by each player can now be displayed in the Results menu. <ul> <li>Relics can only be displayed for sessions played in version 1.02 or later.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Players with a Personal Objective that requires defeating a specific target while Reliving a Remembrance can now embark on Expeditions with players whose Personal Objective does not require defeating a specific target. <ul> <li>Personal Objectives that do not require destroying the target will only appear for one player per Expedition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flask count will now be highlighted in the following situations:</li> <li>When the flask count is at the maximum capacity,</li> <li>When an enemy-induced effect that influences the flask is triggered.</li> <li>The vertical position of the compass’ rune icon will now be displayed if the runes dropped upon death are significantly above or below the player character.</li> <li>You can now highlight specific events that occur on a map layer that is on a different level from the character’s location in the map menu.</li> <li>Adjusted the Dormant Power selection screen so that the HP gauge and other UI elements remain visible while the screen is displayed.</li> <li>Adjusted the weapon lineup in Limveld’s shops.</li> <li>Added Fire Pots to the shop inventory inside the Spirit Shetler.</li> <li>The target-lock on enemies that are behind when the tombstone summoned by Raider’s Ultimate Art appears no longer gets released.</li> </ul> <h2>Balance Adjustments</h2> <p>In general, the trigger conditions of Relic effects that trigger with low HP, equipment passive effects, and special effects have been broadened.</p> <h3>Changes to Passive Effects and Special Effects</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Added new Passive Effects:</strong> <ul> <li>Improved Melee Attack Power</li> <li>Improved Dash Attacks</li> <li>Improved Rolling Attacks</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Attack Power when Two-Handing.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Attack Up when Wielding Two Armaments.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Chain Attack Finishers.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Charge Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Jump Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Skill Attack Power.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Passive Effect Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Talisman Blue-Feathered Branchsword.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Changes to Relic Effects</h3> <ul> <li>Increased the effect of Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Initial Standard Attack.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Critical Hits.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved XXX Damage (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Attack Power with 3+ XX Equipped (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> </ul> <h3>Other Changes</h3> <ul> <li>Reduced the FP consumption and increased the power of the Wrath of Gold Incantation.</li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes &amp;

              <p><span>Every now and then, I remember when </span><i><span>BioShock </span></i><span>lead Ken Levine </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-making-porn-with-my-characters-bioshock-creator-p-1442945516"><span>asked fans to stop sending him porn of Elizabeth from </span><i><span>BioShock Infinite</span></i></a> <span>because it felt like seeing NSFW pictures of a daughter. Smut artists have only gotten bolder in the years since, because they’re sending this art directly to creators on various social media platforms. While some are down for it, Briana White, who voices </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-does-aerith-die-live-sephiroth-1851287690"><span>Aerith</span></a><span> in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span>, is not.</span></p> <p><span>White responded to a video on </span><a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1995571225926795588"><span>X</span></a><span> of Rei Ami, one of the vocalists from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> (and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>unabashed </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span>), talking about how much smut she’d been exposed to of the titular demon-hunting trio. The voice of Zoey said it can be shocking but admitted to seeking some of it out herself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>White responded, saying she doesn’t want people to “normalize” tagging actors in pornographic art of their characters, and that those who do this have “forgotten the meaning of the word ‘inappropriate’.”</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really a shame when [voice actors] want to interact with the people who love the characters on social media, but just a few creeps ruin it for everyone,” White wrote.</span></p> <p><span>“It is a matter of consent,” she continued elsewhere in the thread. “And it can be almost impossible to know what exactly is acceptable or not to an individual just from knowing their social media persona.”</span></p> <p><span>I love smut as much as the next guy, but sending porn to actors unprompted is just harassment. It’s gotta be especially tough when these folks want to be part of the community and get face time with fans, but are met with this weirdo behavior. Draw your porn, write it, and post it on Archive of Our Own, but respect boundaries, folks. Everybody wins.</span></p>

                <p>Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.</p><p>CEO Dave Baszucki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, "We would. I think we would have to do that."</p><p>It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding "loot boxes and kid gambling," so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.</p><p>Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it," he explained.</p><p>Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no "house" setting the odds.</p><p>Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.</p><p><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN</a> to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.</p><p>Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards/kxgameawards-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.</p><p>Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox.

<p>Soak in the Viewros</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's biggest release of the month (the <em>year</em>?) arrives tomorrow, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> finally Morph Ball rolling onto Switch 1 and 2. But with the new hardware still comparatively fresh on store shelves and the holiday season right around the corner, you might be wondering which system is <em>the</em> place to play Samus's latest adventure on.</p>
<p>Here to shed some light on how each version holds up is the above comparison video from the sublime Mr. Alex Olney. As you'll see, the footage shows a direct comparison between the Switch 1 and 2 releases, and the latter's beefed-up specs are immediately obvious.</p>
<p>The side-by-side gameplay showcases Samus in a whole range of environments, demonstrating how the game holds up whatever you throw at it. While fps is no issue for the older console, there's something about the 4K resolution bump on Switch 2 that really sings when put in direct comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't to say that the Switch 1 version provides a 'bad' experience in any way. We had the following to say about the S1 release in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">our 8/10 review</a>: "It plays very well at a very solid 60fps in both docked and handheld, but after getting used to seeing Viewros in stunning 4K (or an internal resolution approaching it), it’s surprising how much the art direction seems to have been built with this in mind".</p>

			<p>IO Interactive is quickly approaching the launch date for what has been described as the peanut butter and chocolate of video games: IO Interactive behind a new James Bond game. 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026</a>, and leading up to that launch, IO Interactive has kicked off a new series of videos on the game's YouTube channel called Beyond the Light, going behind the scenes of the game's development.</p>



<p>The first episode of the series includes reactions and insights from the developers regarding gameplay, with IO Interactive's gameplay director on 007 First Light, Andreas Krogh, and senior level designer Thomas Pulluello featured in the episode.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A little over a week ago, as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox's Partner Preview event</a>, IO Interactive confirmed that 007 First Light will <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/">feature Bond with his iconic silver Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, decked out to the nines with spy gear, courtesy of Q. </p>



<p>Now with the release of this first Beyond the Light series, it's clear that the studio is ramping up towards the launch of its first brand-new major release since 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hitman-3-steady-hand-trigger/">when Hitman 3 first launched</a>. As far as what comes after 007 First Light, just yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">the studio confirmed that it does have another new game in the works</a>.</p>



<p>Not an external IP, but a new internal property it's working on. This is another new title in addition <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/">to the fantasy role-playing game</a> that the studio is working on, for which we don't yet have a title. There will also be more Hitman coming, which means that, including 007 First Light, the studio currently has three projects in the works.</p>



<p>Hopefully, by this time next year, we'll start to hear more about what the studio is working on, since by that point it'll have First Light out the door and can start looking towards what's next.</p>

              <p>McDonald’s released its new holiday meal, and there’s some good (and tasty) news for fans of the fast-food chain’s French fries. Thanks to the Grinch, McShaker fries are finally going to be available in the United States</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/the-grinch-meal-coming-to-mcdonalds.html">McDonald’s new limited-time-only Grinch Meal became available around the country</a>. The Christmas-themed meal, which comes with a pair of limited-time festive holiday socks, is packaged in special bags featuring the Grinch and contains a medium drink, 10 McNuggets or a Big Mac, and some Dill Pickle “Grinch Salt” McShaker Fries. It’s that last item that has some fast-food lovers excited.</p> <p><a href="https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/Shake_Shake_Fries">McShaker Fries appear to be a US version of Shake Shake Fries,</a> a concept that has been around for many, many years in places like Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The fries have also popped up for limited runs in Canada, the United Kingdom, as well as India. Shake Shake Fries come packaged with a seasoning packet and a bag. You dump the fries and seasoning into the bag, close the top, and, well, as the name implies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hj_6TvmsEwI">shake it a few times</a> to cover the fries in tasty dust. The concept has never made its way to the United States until now.</p>

 <p>Early reactions to the Grinch’s dill pickle McShaker Fries are pretty positive, with people hoping McDonald’s keeps the concept around past Christmas and maybe even expands on it with some of the flavors found in other parts of the world. Personally, I’m not a pickle guy at all, so these fries sound awful, but I’m excited to see Shake Shake Fries brought over to the US, even if it is part of a Grinch-themed bundle.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as you are already here and reading about limited-time fast-food meals, <a href="https://news.bk.com/blog-posts/burger-king-r-invites-guests-to-dive-into-a-sea-of-flavor-with-all-new-spongebob-tm-movie-menu">Burger King announced a new <em>SpongeBob</em> movie menu</a>. This menu includes a slice of pie and a real Krabby Patty. It also comes in some delightful-looking SpongeBob-themed packaging that will no doubt be sold for $50 or more on eBay by the end of this week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-comparison-graphics-2000650153</link>

              <p>If you’ve ever worn glasses, then you know this feeling well: Pop on your lenses and, bam, the world is in HD. That’s not a bad way to describe the difference between <i>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</i> running on the original Switch vs. the new Switch 2.</p> <p>Having shipped on both consoles, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> is a <i>prime</i> opportunity to get a sense of the clear technical differences between Nintendo’s newest console and its last-gen hardware. Sure, we know the Switch 2 is powerful, flexing its GPU muscles with <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and some <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">excellent ports of demanding open-world Ubisoft games</a>. But <i>Metroid</i> is a first-party exclusive, so it’s a great opportunity to see the differences when <i>just</i> Nintendo’s hardware is the target.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-gameplay-comparison-ps5-xbox-fps-ubisoft-2000649204">Ubisoft’s Becoming The King Of Switch 2 Ports</a></p> <p>The result? The Switch 2 damn sure renders a pretty picture for our gal Samus’ latest adventure. That said, the OG Switch, while it has a softer image, still looks and runs well enough. The load times though…yeesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/mMc1oik78Vc">This comparison video</a> from ElAnalistaDeBits shows the differences in motion:</p>

  <h2>Switch 2 has a crisper image, and performance mode looks slick</h2> <p>Switch 2 on both quality and performance modes shows a clear advantage when it comes to a higher resolution and clearer images. The performance mode is a touch softer, but you’re trading a bit of fidelity for 120 frames per second. And if you don’t think a framerate that high is worth it, as a former skeptic of anything higher than 60 FPS being worthwhile, I must tell you that you’re wrong.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650159"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650159">© Screenshot: Nintendo / ElAnalistaDeBits / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Switch 1 ain’t nothin’ to sneeze at…but you’re gonna wanna grab a coffee while it loads</h2> <p>If you’re like me and all you have laying around is an original Switch, <i>Metroid Prime 4</i> doesn’t look too terrible. And it runs at 60 FPS, which is swell. But perhaps the worst part of running the game on a classic Switch is you’ll be waiting a long time for it to load. The comparison video above shows a loading sequence that only takes the Switch 2 a mere 24 seconds, while the OG console loads in at over a minute and four seconds. Reminds me of playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> on PS4 (still had a great time! But man did I do a lotta waiting).</p>

 <h2>If you’re looking for an excuse to upgrade, <i>Metroid</i> might just be it</h2> <p>Sometimes ya gotta make due with the hardware you have. But if you’ve got some cash burning a hole in your pocket and you’re ready to step into Nintendo’s next generation, and you love <i>Metroid</i>, it seems like the Switch 2 version might make the upgrade worth it. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><i>Nintendo Life</i> puts it in their review of <i>Beyond</i></a>, once you see the “next-gen” version in motion, it’s hard to go back:</p> <blockquote><p>Playing this on Switch 1 when docked feels fine enough, but that crispness, that pop, that ludicrously intricate, high-contrast detail, it’s just a bit fuzzy and pixelly by comparison. I personally feel it’s almost the direct antithesis to <i>Pokémon Legends Z-A</i>, which actually felt as though the art style was more cohesive on the weaker platform. Textures have taken an understandable hit, and models that are further away can look quite smeary, but overall the game still looks good. I just can’t help but compare it unfavourably to Switch 2.</p></blockquote> <p>Again, given that the original console runs the game at 60 frames per second, I’d wager the experience of playing the game will still feel good enough, even if it’s a little soft compared to what the latest hardware can deliver. But what are upgrades for if we’re not getting prettier pixels? If you do snag&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em> for the OG Switch and end up acquiring a Switch 2 down the line, you can also upgrade the Switch 1 version to the prettier Switch 2 version for an extra 10 bucks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have revealed new details for the Winter Offensive update ahead of its arrival. </p>



<p>Developers of Battlefield 6 have been hard at work figuring out all the issues players have been facing in the title. The developers recently addressed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-addressed-by-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game audio issues</a>, stating that they should be fixed with the next update. Now, the intel on the next major update has dropped.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-drops-on-december-9">Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive Update Drops on December 9</h2>



<h3 id="h-audio-improvements">Audio Improvements </h3>



<p>A new post on the BattlefieldComms account on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) dives deeper into Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive Update. The first thing confirmed is the previously mentioned audio issues, which will be fixed. The devs are prioritizing important combat and vehicle sounds and performing a comprehensive pass on footsteps to improve clarity, distance definition, and positional awareness across the game. At the same time, they are working on performance and memory issues that could cause sounds not to play as intended. </p>



<h3 id="h-mode-adjustments">Mode Adjustments</h3>



<p>Next up is mode adjustments, both Rush and Breakthrough are getting significant updates after Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive arrives, focusing on improving attacker flow, reducing defender oversaturation, and tightening clarity around objectives. Breakthrough will see capture volumes and vehicle availability updated across several maps, and these changes have been guided by “feedback and internal data to help bring win rates closer together for both teams.”</p>



<p>Rush, on the other hand, will see adjustments to M-COM locations on the Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak to give attackers more reliable access and to smooth out the flow between sectors. Moreover, both modes will see multiple capture zones reshaped or clarified to help players understand where to contest or defend. Vehicle spawns have also been adjusted to reduce bottlenecks and remove frustration points. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have also made a range of quality-of-life improvements across UI clarity, minimap behavior, controller aiming responsiveness, and more. They will also be looking into the recent performance issues reported by players. </p>



<h3 id="h-combat-system">Combat System</h3>



<p>Some significant changes will be made to the combat system with Battlefield 6’s Winter Offensive update. Starting with hit registration and netcode, the new update will improve how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including when shots are fired while transitioning into a zoom. The improvements will also correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and readability. </p>



<p>They have also made updates to handle high-density combat scenarios more reliably, ensuring bullets register more consistently when multiple players are fighting in close proximity. The issue where clients could briefly display specific pieces of geometry as intact even though they have been destroyed has been fixed. </p>



<p>Next, we come to soldier visibility: the upcoming Battlefield 6 Winter Offensive update has refined how visibility effects activate at close range, so that soldiers stand out more clearly in darker or low-contrast areas. Prone animations have been updated to include more subtle movement, improving the player’s visibility. They are also looking at improvements to lighting and exposure, especially in indoor-to-outdoor transitions and how characters read against complex environments.</p>



<p>Last but not least is weapon adjustments, and the new BF6 update will bring a wide range of improvements to weapon handling, including fixes towards first-shot accuracy, attachment behavior, and tuning across various recoil patterns and weapon categories. The new changes intend to deliver more predictable, consistent weapon performance in active combat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Unveils New Gacha System]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/</link>
            <guid>1371901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Gacha system is set to arrive in Marvel Rivals, giving players the opportunity to pick up a range of fresh rewards at a reduced cost—provided luck is on your side.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, a Gacha system is a mechanic where players spend in-game currency to receive a random item from a predetermined pool. It’s a gamble, essentially: you might hit the jackpot, or you might walk away with something far less exciting. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/envy-is-the-third-major-team-pulling-out-of-marvel-rivals-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, this new system appears to center  around a brand-new Psylocke skin, which seems to be the headline reward in the draw.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-gacha-system-revealed-for-marvel-rivals">New Gacha System Revealed For Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Better hope you pop the right balloon! Credit to NetEase.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals is rolling out its first-ever Gacha bundle as part of Phase 2 of its First Anniversary Live Event, introducing a new way for players to chase cosmetics. This time, fans can spend in-game Units for a shot at unlocking a full set of new Psylocke cosmetics, but how much they’ll ultimately pay depends entirely on luck.</p>



<p>The system works on an escalating cost model: each pull increases in price. The first attempt is 100 Units, followed by 200, until all balloons in the Gacha are popped. The key twist, however, is that if a player hits the anniversary Psylocke skin early, every remaining reward is granted automatically. That means the entire bundle could cost as little as 100 Units—or, if fortune doesn’t cooperate, the full 2,400.</p>







<p>It marks a noticeable shift from Marvel Rivals’ usual cosmetic distribution methods. Traditionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-players-can-grab-free-marvel-rivals-winter-soldier-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skins and bundles</a> could be purchased directly from the store or earned through Season Pass progression. This new Gacha system offers a potentially cheaper but inherently riskier alternative, likely appealing to players who enjoy the thrill of chance. For others, the predictability of buying a skin outright may still be preferable.</p>



<p>Still, the ceiling is reassuringly familiar. With 2,400 Units matching standard store pricing for a full skin bundle, players can’t overspend—and there’s always the tempting prospect of paying far less than usual.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The highly-acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> just added yet another accolade to its name — as it's now the biggest new third-party game launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the news today after examining data from every day one Xbox Game Pass launch this year, and ranking every third-party game by the number of unique users during its first 30 days of availability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hugely impressive achievement for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the debut game from French studio Sandfall Interactive, for several different reasons. Firstly, because the game arrived just two days after Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered (which itself also launched via Game Pass). And secondly, because we already know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Clair Obscur went on to sell very well too</a> (5 million copies in five months) — something its launch via Game Pass does not appear to have dented.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players," Sandfall creative director Guillaume Broche said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before," Broche continued. "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what was Clair Obscur's Xbox Game Pass competition? It's been a long year, so it's worth reminding ourselves of everything the turn-based RPG has beaten to become this year's biggest third-party Xbox Game Pass release. (And remember, this is separate to Microsoft's own first-party output, which will include Avowed and South by Midnight, as well as Bethesda games such as The Outer Worlds 2, and Activision fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other third-party games that arrived day one via Microsoft's subscription service notably included the highly-anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong, as well as the post-apocalyptic survival game Atomfall. The highly-acclaimed indie puzzle favorite Blue Prince also arrived this year, as did Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Ball X Pit, and PowerWash Simulator 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations, then, to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — something we may well be hearing a few more times this month, considering its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">record-breaking number of nominations at The Game Awards</a>.

It will launch on December 18. <span id="more-1010963"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Summitsphere:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>The Demon Corp</strong> – This band of bastards has been rehearsing each day for the Big Tournament, and now it’s their time to shine. That’s right, FOUR new (smaller-scale!) boss fights against each member of the Demon Corp. Claim your Prize Star by defeating each of them and be granted early access into their big show!</li><li><strong>The Big Tournament: The Boss Rush</strong> – Danton has been laboring over day and night and has at last fulfilled his contract to bring the Big Tournament to life! Earn your Battle Pass and prepare to face <em>ANTONBLAST</em>‘s most grueling challenge: Face against the game’s nine major boss fights without facing a knock-out and claim your title of Tournament Champion! There is a big cash prize in it for the winner, too.</li><li><strong>The Lime Trials</strong> – The mysterious Lime Trials make their appearance. Defeat the big baddie of each wing of Brulo’s Casino, and you will be granted access to a new kind of timed challenge: Collect all Limes in the room before time runs out to recover the Souvenir Lime! And, if you feel like showing off after already collecting the Souvenir Lime, claim cash prizes especially if you beat your best time!</li><li><strong>New Game Modes</strong> – As promised to our supporters, our Hard Mode and Stage Rush Mode will finally make their appearance. In Hard Mode, face the challenges of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> with little extra help and stricter, harder stages and bosses. Satan’s troops are a little more prepared this time! In Stage Rush, blast through the twelve stages and eight bosses of the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> campaign as fast as you can! Hard Mode will automatically unlock for any players who have already cleared the first stage in game; Stage Rush will automatically unlock for any players who have defeated the Final Boss. But, could there be more…?</li><li><strong>Danton</strong> – Now that Danton’s work around the Casino is mostly finished, you will find him perusing the area. Feel free to talk to him, he’s really happy about it!</li><li><strong>New Soundtrack and Sound Work</strong> – Our updated <em>ANTONBLAST</em> soundtrack will be wholly replacing the existing tracks in the game. Furthermore, we have extensively touched up our sound design and have totally rebalanced and adjusted the soundscape of the game to prevent audio clipping and other nasty artifacts. The result is the game won’t be as ear-piercingly loud, meaning you can get a much cleaner view (hearing?) of what is actually going on at any given moment in the game and don’t need to turn the audio down so low. It is a much more pleasing experience on everyone’s ears. We have also shifted some sounds around, but you’ll have to play the game to hear the difference!</li><li><strong>New Trinkets</strong> – Brulo’s Shop has been restocked with various new items, such as the Virtual Visor, Game Brick and Pet Paint (harmless, non-toxic). <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> Anton and Annie’s Adventure under… a different light.</li><li><strong>New Spray Cans</strong> – Sixteen new Spray Cans have been added, bringing the total to 110. Most will be hidden, strewn around Brulo’s Casino and Peanut Park, so be sure to be look around carefully!</li><li><strong>New Achievements</strong> – Four new achievements for you to figure out and, well, achieve! Discover the secrets of Peanut Park and engage with the new stages and boss fights and (re-)claim your Perfect title on <em>ANTONBLAST</em>!</li><li><strong>New Language Support</strong> – That’s right, you will be able to experience the glorious text and interface of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> in a total of eight languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin-American Spanish and Brazillian Portuguese. We hope our more international Blasters appreciate and enjoy the work our community localizers have put into the game!</li><li><strong>Lots of Bug Fixes</strong> – I mean, I hope you’re not surprised about it! The team has put TREMENDOUS work into polishing up <em>ANTONBLAST</em> into being the best game ever. We hope it reached that standard now!</li><li><strong>And More!</strong> – There is a lot more that you will see that we have not talked about here. It will all be made clear… in THE END.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ANTONBLAST</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,926 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and is <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/antonblast-coming-to-ps5-ps4-in-2026">coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> in 2026.</p><!-- AD: content -->

While accepting his wins, the game's leading boss Ryozo Tsujimoto shared his conviction that Monster Hunter is still popular among players and he doesn't see any need for the franchise to stop.</p><p>"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play.

S. Anderson and actress Milla Jovovich, the husband-and-wife team behind the first six Resident Evil films. However, Monster Hunter's dismal $47.9 million worldwide box office has seemingly killed any prospect of a sequel.</p><p> Tsujimoto didn't offer any specific updates regarding new Monster Hunter titles, but he reiterated that Monster Hunter Wilds will still be getting updates.</p><p>"Monster Hunter has the characteristics of a title that gets regular updates, but player opinions were very helpful during the update process," wrote Tsujimoto. "And in order to make Monster Hunter Wilds better, the fans’ voices gave us power. There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best."</p><p>During an earnings call for investors in April, Capcom claimed that Monster Hunter Wild's sharp fall-off in sales be address after the first month may have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">due to the high price of a PS5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion Is Officially Delayed to 2026; It Will Be a ‘Living Project’ with Features Like Spellcrafting Possibly Coming Post-Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-officially-delayed-2026-will-be-living-project-features-coming-post-launch/</link>
            <guid>1371868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was January 2023 when the Skyblivion team originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its targeted 2025 launch window. Throughout the past couple of years, the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck to their schedule</a>, maintaining that they would be able to bring the ambitious total conversion project to fruition by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Today, though, Project Lead Rebelzize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a video update</a> to confirm that won't happen, as there are simply too many things left to do. The complete fan-made recreation of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will, therefore, be released at some point in 2026.</p>



<p>The good news is that the game is in a great state, and many aspects are complete or nearly complete. The world map, for example, was troublesome to implement but is now 100% finished, including all unique regions, realms, and the Oblivion Deadlands. Skyblivion fans can now get a glimpse of it through an interactive satellite-style map, <a href="https://skyblivion.com/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now live on the project's website</a>.</p>



<p>All quest dungeons are also complete, rebuilt with new layouts, bespoke boss encounters, and unique quest rewards; only a handful of random dungeons remain unfinished. Most interiors, such as houses, shops, castles, stables, chapels, and inns, are ready. However, many Imperial City interiors are blocked until the city's 3D asset set is finalized, with the expectation to complete all locations by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Indeed, the Skyblivion team outlines the Imperial City as the single largest remaining content challenge. Quest implementation is progressing somewhat smoothly, but is still partially blocked by the remaining work needed in the Imperial City. The goal is to finish quests by Q1 2026, leaving time for playtesting and iteration before launch. Once the Imperial City, navmesh, quests, and core systems like alchemy, spells, perks, and crafting (which should be feature complete by the end of 2025) are wrapped and polished, the modders believe the project will finally be ready for its targeted 2026 release. All other major cities, like Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chorrol, Leyawiin, Skingrad, and the ruined Kvatch, have been implemented.</p>



<p>The User Interface (UI) is still under development. The team has moved toward a more Skyrim-like interface, with function and consistency taking precedence over aesthetics, although a custom reskin may be implemented later. Core UI work is expected to be done by the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Skyblivion Delay to 2026 | A Commitment to Release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Skyblivion team is even developing a large final fight cinematic between Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon, handled by professional animators, but production is bottlenecked by manpower in rendering, set dressing, VFX, and destruction simulation. Rebelzize calls out for volunteer specialists in those areas to apply so the cinematic can reach the desired quality. If you have such expertise and are willing to help, contact the team <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through this form</a>.</p>



<p>Not all features will be included in version 1.0. For example, underwater combat has been cut due to major conflicts with animation mods, although it may be reintroduced at a later date. Indeed, Rebelzize described this as a living project, which will continue to be refined with bug fixes, but also expanded with the original Oblivion DLC (Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine), and with additional features like spell crafting, dynamic dungeons, grave-robbing, more creature variety, followers, weapons, armor sets, and more. </p>



<p>Overall, it's sad news for those who still wished to play Skyblivion during the Holidays. However, even professional games are always prone to delays, let alone volunteer projects like this one. Moreover, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did release the official Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</a>, so those who really want to explore a modern version of the classic roleplaying game already have a way to do so.</p>
