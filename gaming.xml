			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be about to get some new playable characters on PC, judging from a new video shared online.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@d3dnier398" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D3DNieR</a>, shows the Turks Reno and Rude controlled by the player, complete with all of their abilities in their boss battles. Although it's clear that there's still more work to be done for a proper implementation, as Reno's voice doesn't work and every unique ability of the two characters doesn't require any ATB, both characters work remarkably well already, which is quite impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Playable Reno &amp; Rude Test | [REBIRTH]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH2S9LnksUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following its release on PC earlier this year, plenty of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth have been released online, introducing improvements and new features not available in the vanilla game, such as the ability to increase the party size limit past three members and a<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/">dd temporary characters like Zack and Sephiroth to the party</a>, making them playable outside the small segments they are supposed to in the vanilla game. This party mod also allows players to add Cid and Vincent to the party, although the two characters aren't playable as they have no moveset, an issue that crashes the game whenever they are added to the frontline party.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the Remake trilogy by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has yet to be officially announced, but the work of a dedicated user is providing a better look at the unannounced remaster today.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JamesIV4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JamesIV4</a> restored some of the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oblivion-remastered-dark-screenshots-restored-KscfaBJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots</a> that leaked online <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a>, which were considerably darker than others as they were likely intended as a backdrop for things like store pages or banners, as the user pointed out. Every location shown in the screenshots looks gorgeous in the restored images, but the night skybox in the Dock at night screenshot looks particularly impressive.</p>
<p>Following months of rumors and speculation, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was proven to be real earlier this week, when the aforementioned screenshots leaked online via the Virtuos official website. While there was no need for another confirmation that the game is real, mentions of the remaster have recently been discovered on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Bethesda website</a>, so all that is truly left is an official announcement and launch, which should happen sometime next week, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">multiple insiders.</a></p>
<p>2025 is going to be a remarkable year for fans of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, as fans will likely be able to experience a recreation of the game in Skyrim with the Skyblivion project, regardless of the launch of Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Yesterday</a>, Skyblivion lead Rebelzize commented on how the official remaster will not impact the passion-fueled project as long as Bethesda allows it to exist.</p>

There’s a Charizard box packed with collectibles, a DOOM Xbox controller that looks like it could double as a weapon, and a <em>Last of Us</em> vinyl set that might just make you cry on your living room floor. Been there.</p><div id="218684" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Add MLB.TV and Get $30 Off Your First Month of Sling</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Now through May 31, you can tack on MLB.TV and stream every single out-of-market game and get $30 off your first month of Sling TV.

I’m glad it’s back and actually on sale. You get a shiny Charizard ex, Charmander and Charmeleon promos, a display figure, and ten booster packs. That’s a solid value for under 50 bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the kind of product that works for both collectors and anyone trying to build out a fire-heavy deck. The packaging alone makes it feel like a gift, even if you’re just giving it to your future self. You get the following packs:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Stellar Crown</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Twilight Masquerade</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Paradox Rift</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Temporal Forces</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Obsidian Flames</p></div><p id="xbox-wireless-controller-doom-the"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The">Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The Dark Ages LE</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218887"><div id="218887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Wireless Controller – DOOM: The Dark Ages LE</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pre-order now, releases April 30</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this just to display it. This controller has matte green armor, silver spikes, a sinister red thumbstick, and buttons labeled in the Sentinel alphabet. I’m convinced it could survive a drop from orbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still a standard Xbox and Bluetooth controller underneath all the theatrics, so it’ll work across consoles, PC, and cloud. I think it’s the best kind of extra. Completely over-the-top, but still totally usable.</p></div><p id="the-last-of-us-10th-anniversary-viny"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Viny">The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set - 4LP</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218888"><div id="218888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set - 4LP</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t even play vinyl and I still want this sitting on my shelf. The music from <em>Last of Us</em> is unforgettable, and this set leans all the way into the emotion. It includes four colored records, a slipcase that looks like it’s been through some stuff, and two beautiful lithographs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gustavo Santaolalla’s soundtrack is about as iconic as game music gets. In my opinion, if you felt anything during that main theme, you’re going to want this in your collection.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218889"><div id="218889" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this box is for anyone who loves both strategy and structure. It comes with nine booster packs, a full-art promo of N’s Zorua, a mountain of energy cards, dice, sleeves, and even a collector’s box with dividers. It’s basically a starter kit for organized chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not the cheapest trainer box out there, but the amount of content here definitely gives it an edge if you're all in on the Scarlet &amp; Violet era.</p></div><p id="return-to-metroidvania-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Return to Metroidvania Game Bundle">Return to Metroidvania Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218890"><div id="218890" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Return to Metroidvania Game Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity Cool Effect.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle is a steal. For fourteen bucks, you’re getting eight quality indie games, and at least three of them could easily stand on their own. I picked it up for Gato Roboto, which is exactly what it sounds like: a cat in a mech suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is ideal for anyone who wants games that actually let you explore and experiment. The titles are highly rated, weird in the best way, and don’t take up 80 gigs of storage. It’s refreshing.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218891"><div id="218891" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Alright, I’ll be honest. This one’s a bit of a wildcard. You get one booster pack, randomly selected, and that's it. The listing makes it clear you don’t get to pick the pack art or contents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t build a collection around this, but if you need to nudge your cart over the free shipping threshold or just like rolling the dice, this might do the trick.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218892"><div id="218892" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle skips the extras and gets right to the point: six booster packs from the latest expansion. If you're just here for the cards and not the fluff, this is a clean, solid option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like using these as a supplement to the bigger trainer boxes, or as a low-effort gift for a Pokémon fan who definitely already has more cards than they need.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-151-bo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Bo">Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218823"><div id="218823" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is $26.94</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle brings back the original 151 Pokémon with modern mechanics and new artwork, making it a highly sought-after product among longtime fans and collectors. It’s marketed as a great way to access the set without buying a full booster display box, and it consistently sells out quickly. Still, at nearly twice the standard retail price, it’s worth thinking twice unless you’ve had trouble finding it elsewhere.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-sleeved-b"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved B">Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218824"><div id="218824" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently the number one best-seller in collectible booster packs on Amazon, Surging Sparks includes over 250 cards, new Pokémon ex, ACE SPEC cards, and more than 50 cards featuring special illustrations. With solid pull potential and a modest price point, it’s an easy recommendation for casual players and serious collectors. Each pack contains 10 cards and is eligible for fast, free Prime shipping.</p></div><p id="the-last-of-us-joel-with-hatchet-b"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet B">The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet Bust</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218825"><div id="218825" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet Bust</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Available now for pre-order, this officially licensed Joel bust from Dark Horse and Naughty Dog stands 8.5 inches tall, reaching 11 inches at the top of the hatchet. The statue features detailed texturing on Joel’s flannel, backpack, and face, all set on a battle-worn concrete base with moss and bullet holes. It includes a certificate of authenticity and is scheduled to ship in August 2025. Ideal for collectors and fans of The Last of Us looking to lock in a centerpiece item.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218826"><div id="218826" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This newly released tin includes five booster packs and one random foil promo card featuring either Kyogre ex, Xerneas ex, or Dialga ex. Inside, you’ll find a mix of packs from recent expansions including Surging Sparks, Temporal Forces, Stellar Crown, and Obsidian Flames. It’s a solid mid-tier pickup for anyone looking to expand their collection with newer sets in one convenient package.</p></div><p id="dice-destiny-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle">Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218827"><div id="218827" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle features seven well-reviewed indie RPGs including Disco Elysium, Citizen Sleeper, Broken Roads, Roadwarden, and both Pillars of Eternity games.

Each blister contains 10 cards, with a chance to pull some of the newer generation cards and artwork styles. While the pack style you receive is random, this is a good opportunity to sample the set at a much lower price than usual.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218700"><div id="218700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time I’ve seen the ETB for a reasonable price without having to buy it from someone’s backseat eBay hustle. Nine booster packs, full-art N’s Zorua promo, card sleeves, energy, dice, the works. I’ve seen this box selling for $90+ since launch, so $70.31 from Amazon is genuinely solid. Lillie’s Clefairy ex is still floating around $180 and N’s Zoroark ex has dropped to $13, which tells me the hype has deflated and we’re in “buy because it’s fun” territory again. I like it here.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218701"><div id="218701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the low-frills version for people who just want to open packs without pretending they’re going to organize their collection. Six Journey Together boosters and none of the ETB fluff. Honestly, this is how I like to test a set when prices cool off. You still have a shot at cards like Salamence ex SIR, which tanked from $250 to around $106, or a sub-$20 N’s Reshiram. Even if you pull nothing, at least you didn’t overpay trying to win the cardboard lottery.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218703"><div id="218703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I threw one of these in my cart last week just to hit the free shipping minimum. One pack, random art, decent discount. There’s no reason to expect anything big, but the price is finally low enough that I don’t feel bad if I just pull a Furret. And if you happen to land something like Articuno’s Illustration Rare (now $18.69) or Wailord (around $14.55), it’s a nice win from a $10 impulse buy.</p></div><p id="train-sim-world-5-route-remix-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle">Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218704"><div id="218704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know how many people wake up wanting ten train simulator add-ons, but if you’re one of them, today is your day. For $15, you get Train Sim World 5’s Starter Pack plus nine routes and loco add-ons. Antelope Valley, Cajon Pass, Thameslink, Santa Fe F7—the whole diesel buffet. It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products. It’s a smart LED floor lamp with AI-generated lighting modes, music sync, voice control, app scheduling, and a vibe for every mood. It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes. I think it’s great if you want one light to do everything without fiddling with settings for half an hour.</p></div><p id="lepro-b2-ai-smart-light-bulbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs">Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218706"><div id="218706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the same AI bulbs as the ones in the floor lamp, but in classic 75W-equivalent LED form. They’re bright, colorful, and weirdly helpful if you’re too tired to fine-tune your lighting manually. The music sync is fun, the AI scenes work well, and the voice commands actually feel smart instead of gimmicky. I bought a set of these last month and haven’t touched the wall switch since. At $8 per bulb, it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls.

It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment.

I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf.

I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond.

Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>League of Legends' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">first ever themed season</a>, Welcome to Noxus, is about to wrap up and Riot has announced Season 2: Spirit Blossom Beyond. The next season will bring changes to the Summoner's Rift map and general gameplay, a new champion, new Spirit Blossom skins, and a brand-new game mode titled Brawl.</p><p>Spirit Blossom is already a popular skin line and recurring theme in LoL, based around Ionian myths and folklore tied to the region's Spirit Blossom festivals. Riot announced the seasonal theme with a new cinematic titled Here, Tomorrow--an anime-style animation created in partnership with The Line--set to an original track by singer-songwriter Lilas Ikuta and composer Kevin Penkin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4l0KBAn6LU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T4l0KBAn6LU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The music video crosses between the "real" world of Ionia and its spirit-world counterpart, featuring a number of popular champions including Ashe, Nidalee, Lux, Shen, Irelia, and Morgana. The video focuses on Xin Zhao, who is shown returning to Ionia, and seems to reveal the season's new champion, Yunara. Xin Zhao's story will be explored throughout the season with the first of two motion comics arriving on May 14, and Riot has also said to expect an in-client metagame based on the season's story.</p><p>Once Season 2 launches on April 30, Spirit Blossom Beyond will take over Summoner's Rift with not just aesthetic changes, but also gameplay changes that will have an impact on the game's meta. In the new season, Atakhan will only have a single form called Thornbound Atakhan, rather than swapping between two forms. Void Grubs will now spawn later and only once per match, while the Rift Herald will now spawn at 15 minutes and will be easier to take down.</p><p>From the start of Season 2, only junglers will have access to the Smite summoner spell, which will be automatically assigned to players in that role. A number of other tweaks and tuning changes are coming in with the new season, which the devs have detailed in a recent <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-season-2-gameplay-changes-preview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev blog</a>.</p><p>The new season will also include a new 5v5 game mode called Brawl, which Riot describes as a "faster-paced, lower-stakes game mode" that puts the emphasis on combat. Brawl will feature a brand-new map based on Bandle City, and with no towers or other objectives to focus on, players will have to go head-to-head with each other to push their minions into the enemy base.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Spirit Blossom-themed season will also include a new handful of Spirit Blossom skins, a popular skin line that already features over 20 different champions. The champions in line for Spirit Blossom skins this time include Ashe, Irelia, Bard, Varus, Zyra, and Ivern. Prestige Spirit Blossom Lux and Spirit Blossom Ivern will be available to be earned on the paid battle pass. Riot has also revealed that Morgana has an Exalted skin on the way.</p><p>Spirit Blossom Beyond launches on April 30, taking the spotlight from the current Noxian-themed season. However the LoL universe will be returning to Noxus sooner or later, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-cinematic-from-arcane-studio-continues-shows-story/1100-6528678/" data-ref-id="1100-6528678">next Arcane spin-off show</a> likely to revolve around that region. Arcane co-creator Christian Linke also said that the show would be exploring Ionia and Demacia with future series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-zelda-games-wont-support-cloud-saves-to-backup-your-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> Editions of both Zelda games won't support cloud saves for data backup, and it's currently unclear why.</p>
<p>On the store pages for both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> on Switch 2, a disclaimer reads: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership's Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p>
<p>This same disclaimer is not present for other Switch 2 Edition games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> - so it's unclear why this is only impacting Zelda games.</p>

<p>What's more, this disclaimer is only on the US and EU store pages. The <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096248">Japanese page</a> still states the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership is required for the use of the save data storage service (machine translation).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? As a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/">ResetEra</a> noted, players can import their save file from the original Switch to continue using the Switch 2 Edition of the game, but then won't be able to create a new cloud save file as they continue.</p>
<p>What's more, it seems even if players start a fresh save using the Switch 2 Edition, they still won't be able to backup their save file.</p>
<p>But why exactly would this only be the case for Zelda and not other games? For now, the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Editions of original Switch games do bring plenty of upgrades. The Zelda games, for instance, have improved visual performance as well as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">updated app with achievements</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-zelda-ports-let-players-repair-equipment-using-accompanying-app">new method to repair equipment</a>.</p>
<p>In the UK, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">complete updated editions for the new console will cost £65</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-games-will-be-complete-on-the-card-without-a-download-nintendo-confirms">all data included on the game card</a> - something Nintendo clarified following confusion.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Breath of the Wild won't include the original game's DLC on Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda is yet to officially announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but we all know it's real. Along with those  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project have also been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a>. It is safe to say with this remake it's just a case of when, not if.</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the team working Skyblivion, the volunteer-based project by TESRenewal seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine? Has news of an official remake caused the bounce to go from their collective bungee? (To paraphrase Wallace and Gromit, there.)</p>

<figcaption>Our Jim has thoughts on the Oblivion remake, or rather, the lack of a Morrowind remake. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH0bzE6hGhE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, no, this is not the case at all. <a href="https://x.com/rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140">Writing on social media</a>, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the team working on Skyblivion are concerned.</p>
<p>Rebelzize said the "real remake is the friends we made along the way", before stating the Skyblivion mod was and remains "a passion project".</p>
<p>In fact, Rebelzize sees it as a "win-win" for the Oblivion community which will get "twice the amount of Oblivion this year".</p>

<p>"All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster," Rebelzize wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912505305163792886">subsequent post</a>, Rebelzize added: "Since this got a lot more attention [than] I expected, let me just say I hope you will enjoy either the official or our remake. Either way thanks for the support and be kind to one another."</p>
<p>Team Folon - the group behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">ambitious Fallout London mod for Fallout 4</a> - shared Rebelzize's post, writing: "We stand by you. All our love Skyblivion team."</p>

<p>As mentioned, Skyblivion is a voluntary project that fans of The Elder Scrolls games have been working on quite some time. The Skyblivion team has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-video-of-skyblivion-which-is-oblivion-in-skyrim">steadily documenting its progress for over a decade now</a>, and I think I just felt myself age as rapidly as that chap in The Last Crusade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion blog post</a> shared a roadmap for the mod's release, affirming it will "close shut the jaws of Oblivion in 2025".</p>

<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p>
<p>Think he's on to something?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/16/space-marine-2-update-lets-you-make-a-trygon-become-a-bygone-heres-the-patch-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is here, and it brings another big batch of free content, including a new PvE Operation and a new Tyranid boss, the Trygon which lends the update its name. There’s also plenty of new PvP content, season pass additions and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Trygon Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oAHVCnAXxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new PvE Operation, Extraction, tasks you with reaching the Adeptus Mechanicus facility on Avarax, figuring out where the Tech-Priest is that is refusing to extract, and try to get them out of there, if they’ve survived so far. Along the ay you’ll face off against the Trygon, a huge burrowing Tyranid that creates underground passageways for other Tyranid to us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you can now earn Prestige Ranks in PvE – visit the Armouring Hall once you’ve reached level 25 and activate prestiging from the Skill Tree screen – there’s private PvP lobbies, a new Inferno Pistol secondary, new customisation options, and updates to the weapons, weapon perks, matchmaking and a bunch of other bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>For Season Pass holders, there’s the new Space Wolves Chapter Pack and Imperial Fists Champion Pack to let you customise your look in even more ways.</p>

<p>See all of those in the full patch notes:</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p><b>New Operation — Exfiltration</b></p>
<p><i>Exfiltration takes place on Avarax at the outskirts of an Imperial Hive City ravaged by the Tyranids. Your mission is to reach a Mechanicus facility, extract a rogue Tech-Priest and fight a Trygon; a giant, burrowing Tyranid that&nbsp; creates underground passageways for other Tyranid organisms.</i></p>
<p><b>Private Lobbies in PvP</b></p>
<p><i>A custom lobby to invite your fellow Space Marines. You can choose the mode and map, and also change the gameplay settings, like score or time limit or even damage modifiers to create your own fun game modes.</i></p>
<p><b>Prestige Ranks in PvE</b></p>
<p><i>The Prestige system allows you to continue empowering your Class even after reaching the maximum level. Once you have reached level 25, go to the Armouring Hall and follow the activation procedure in the Skill Tree screen. There, you can reset the Class’ progress to the first level to unlock one Prestige Perk. After this, you can raise the Class level to 25 again. Thus, a Class can get up to 4 active Prestige Perks simultaneously. <b>Each prestige rank increases XP gain by 10%.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Progressing your Prestige ranks will also grant you unique cosmetic rewards for each rank you unlock.</i></p>
<p><b>PvE Extended List of Available Weapons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heavy</b>: Heavy Bolt Rifle | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Tactical</b>: Combat Knife | Plasma Pistol | Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Assault</b>: Power Sword | Plasma Pistol</li>
<li><b>Bulwark</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol</li>
<li><b>Sniper</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Instigator Bolt Carbine</li>
<li><b>Vanguard</b>: Heavy Bolt Pistol | Bolt Carbine</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Originally the classes were not balanced around having these weapons. Some of those changes are only meant to bring more variety, fun and lore accuracy to the game.</i></p>
<p><i>Not every change here will make every weapon competitive with the rest of class loadouts.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This isn’t the last pass on this, we will continue to monitor the game and make necessary changes. We still have some more ideas how we can expand loadouts more, without breaking the lore and while keeping class identity, but those changes will take a while to implement.</i></p>
<p><strong>New Secondary Weapon: Inferno Pistol</strong></p>
<p><em>Available for Sniper, Heavy, Assault and Vanguard classes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Class-based matchmaking in Operations mode</strong></p>
<p><i>This is a first iteration of the system that is designed to reduce frequency of matchmaking with other people with the same classes. It is not going to prevent this 100%, there will always be some edge cases. We will be tweaking and improving the system on our backend as we go.</i></p>
<p><b>Experimental skill-based matchmaking and team balancing in Eternal War mode</b></p>
<p><i>This system should make matchmaking in PvP more fair. This is an experimental feature, we will be turning it on and off on the backend and monitoring the results. It will take a while for it to shape up.</i></p>
<p><b>Public Test Server (PTS)</b></p>
<blockquote><p><i>We are really happy with the PTS experiment that we had. We got a lot of feedback from the community that allowed us to implement changes ahead of actual live release. While having PTS is an additional stress for our team and will cause some delays to live patches we are going to keep doing that for all major content updates moving forward.</i></p>
<p><i>The PTS will be closed for now, but we’ll reopen it once we’ll be looking for your feedback on upcoming features.</i></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>New Season Pass Content</b></h3>
<p><b>Space Wolves Chapter Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Champion (Vanguard).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Weapon Skins (Bolt Carbine, Thunder Hammer, Chainsword).</li>
<li>Space Wolves Chapter Customisation (Helmet, Chest, Pauldron, Greave, Heraldry markings).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Imperial Fists Champion Pack:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Imperial Fists Champion (Tactical).</li>
<li>Imperial Fists Signature Weapon Skin (Plasma Incinerator).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customisation</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>New Colours:</b> New default colours Volupus Pink and Thousand Sons Blue.</li>
<li><b>Bulwark Cloth Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the cloth for Bulwark tabard has been added as an option for the chest armour piece for customisation.</li>
<li><b>Hands Recolouring:</b> New feature to recolour the gauntlet armour piece is added. Now the primary colour is used to colour a fist and the secondary one colours a wrist and a shoulder part of the hand. <i>(This one is for you, Iron Hands and Crimson Fists fans!)</i></li>
<li>Lots of minor fixes for customisation of armour parts and emblems.​</li>
</ul>
<h2>​Gameplay &amp; Balancing tweaks</h2>
<h3>Progression Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Rebalance Rewards in the Eternal War Mode&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Match rewards are increased by 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Base EXP for PvE is increased</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Base XP for all difficulties in Operation Mode is increased by 10%.</p>
<h3>PvE Weapon Perks Update</h3>
<p><i>With this update we are rolling out a massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks. As a result all weapons received buffs one way or another.</i></p>
<p><i>Some notes regarding our future plans in terms of balancing: I want to say that I’m not a big fan of changing too many things at the same time. It is hard to predict the outcome, it’s a risk of introducing bugs and not every change is a simple number change. Past 2 patches changelogs were several pages long. I’m more in favor of gradual improvements of the game rather than chaotic changes back and forth. This means that we do see your feedback on some of the class perks and weapons etc, even looking at the current weapon perks rework I feel like we could have done a better job with plasma weapons and power sword perks.</i></p>
<p><i>There will be a second pass on class, weapon and prestige perks. Probably around Patch 8. I do think that those systems are in much much better shape than they were before patches and on release, the scope of the second pass will be smaller.</i></p>

<h3>Class Perks Update</h3>
<p><b>Tactical</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiating Impact</b>: Fixed incorrect bonus stack with Auspex Scan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sniper</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Fixed incorrect stacking values of Sniper’s <b>Renewal</b> and <b>Squad Renewal</b> perks.&nbsp;</i><i>This resulted in following changes:</i></li>
<li><b>Squad Renewal</b>: Fixed incorrect ability charge restoring (15% instead of planned 10%).</li>
<li><b>Renewal</b>: Fixed typo in the description (5% ability charge restored instead of actual 15%).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Heavy</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced Force</b>: Fixed bonus to melee hold attacks that was mistakenly working in addition to bonus to all melee attacks.</li>
<li>General Balancing</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Assault (PvE only)</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jump Pack Ability</b>: recharge speed increased by 10%.</li>
<li><b>Contested Heals Restoring by Ground Pound was changed</b>: Ground Pound restores 30% of max contested health, regardless of the type of enemy and their number. When hitting with Ground Pound, 30% of max contested health is restored.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is a major buff to Assault survivability, because previously its contested health restore depended on too many factors. Now it is significantly increased and will be consistent.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a maximum cap to restore fade HP per action; and a max target to restore health per action to the following weapons:a</li>
<li>Multi-Melta</li>
<li>Melta Rifle</li>
<li>Heavy&nbsp;Plasma Incinerator</li>
<li>Plasma Incinerator</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This change may sound drastic on paper, but in reality the limit isn’t that strict. It only prevents situations where a single shot from Melta could restore the entire health bar when hitting only 3-4 enemies at the same time. Plus, the contested health restore will be more consistent now.</i></p>
<p>Firearms (PvE only)</p>
<p><i>We are continuing to polish up weapon balance and I think we are in a good spot right now where all weapons are viable on Absolute difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>Sure, some of them are still worse than others and we will continue to tweak them. Our next big objective is to take a closer look at weapon versions balance within the same archetype. Especially melee weapons.</i></p>
<p><b>Occulus Bolt Carbine&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The <b><i>Master-Crafted – Alpha</i></b> (Accuracy) version of the Occulus Bolt Carbine has -15% spread now instead of the +15% spread.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Multi-Melta</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the bug where the rate-of-fire versions of the Multi-Melta did not have an increased rate of fire. Now, the Master-Crafted version has a 15% increase in RoF, the Artificer version has a 25% increase, and the Relic version has a 35% increase.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bolt Rifle (all versions)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Base damage increased by 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Auto Bolt Rifle</b></p>

<ul>

While we may still have questions around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s pricing and mouse controls, extensive hands-on time with Nintendo's new console has left us in no doubt of one thing: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World is an absolute banger</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Join us today as we hear more directly from Nintendo on its biggest Switch 2 launch title, and - if you're not sold yet - maybe you'll see something that ultimately helps justify <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s standalone £75/$80 cost.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct kicks off at 2pm UK time - that's 9am Eastern, or a 6am Pacific if you're over the pond - and is set to last for around 15 minutes. We'll be reporting live - let us know what you want to see!

<p>One thing I've wondered about today is whether we'll see Mario Kart World's post-launch support detailed, and whether the price is designed to include access to all of that - rather than a season pass. Time will tell.</p>

<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">hands-on with Mario Kart World</a> immediately after the Switch 2 was revealed, and came away very impressed indeed. It is clearly the console's killer app - and a bold reinvention of the series' familiar gameplay.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off," I wrote earlier this month. "With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title. I absolutely can't wait to play more."</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Retro gaming used to require a lot of hard work. Getting old consoles to play happily with modern, flatscreen displays was a constant challenge that wearied the very idea of it, ultimately making it an easier option to put everything in the loft and play the latest Call of Duty instead. That’s no longer the case, though, with retro handhelds becoming an affordable and fun option for playing all your older games, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H is one of the cheapest retro gaming devices on the planet, coming in for less than £40 in the UK – it’s listed as having a <a href="https://r36h.com/">$49.99 RRP</a> but our unit was listed on AliExpress for a slightly ridiculous £18.27 with a 64GB memory card, before shipping and fees. The handheld shows some signs of that accessible price point, but its quality far exceeds the expectations you might have for a console priced this low.</p>



<p>Our review unit came in pure white, though the R36H is also available in grey, transparent black, purple or orange. Laid out horizontally with buttons on either side of the screen, it shares a similar outlook to Retroid’s older Pocket devices, with a chunky, slightly boxy aesthetic. It’s not sleek or premium-looking like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, but it’s charming in its own way. For the price I wasn’t expecting it to look or feel as good as it does, and it immediately sets you up for a positive experience.</p>
<p>The Boyhom R36H has a 3.5” IPS display, with a 640×480 resolution. Its 4:3 ratio makes it ideal for older games, and it’s plenty bright and vibrant. Frankly, it’s a continual source of surprise every time you boot a game up how good the display is, and for the type of games the R36H is capable of playing, you couldn’t ask for more.</p>

<p>Internally, the R36H is equipped with a RK3326 chipset and 1GB of DDR3L RAM. It’s definitely not the most powerful device out there, but for retro games up to and including the Dreamcast, it provides enough power to keep everything running smoothly, and relatively efficiently.</p>
<p>It uses Arkos 2.0, an open-source Linux-based operating system, that does exactly what it needs to, in so far as it lets you dump a frontend like Emulation Station onto it that pulls together your ROMS into different categories, with some smart artwork and labels to make it all make sense.</p>
<p>You’ll find Arkos on a batch of Powkiddy and Anbernic devices, and it’s been around for long enough to be well-optimised, keeping you gaming for longer, and with decent performance. The system as a whole is a little on the slow side, so hopping in and out of games can feel lethargic, but in-game, you’ll never notice. It boasts a 3000mAh battery – though its own advertising gets confused between 3000mAh and 3500mAh, but either way it’s plenty to keep you going for between 5 and 6 hours, and maybe even longer if you’re playing less demanding titles. One annoyance is that the battery LED can’t be turned off, and it’s lit at all times, even when you’re not playing. You can choose between it being red or green though, so… there’s that.</p>

<p>Everything has been stripped back in the R36H, and when you consider the price, that’s not surprising. There’s no Bluetooth or WiFi here, so any updates or connections need to be done via wired connections, or installing data onto your MicroSD cards. There are two MicroSD slots on the R36H, one for your OS, and the other for your ROMS, and they do exactly what you need of them. It makes working with the R36H slightly clunky, but chances are this is a device that would serve well as a gift, or a starting point for the retro gaming hobby, rather than the end point like the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, there’s some additional functionality with HDMI output via a USB-C OTG connection, which is a nice inclusion.</p>
<p>One of the best things about the Boyhom R36H is the D-pad. It’s sturdy, responsive, and ideal for classic retro games like Mario or Metroid. Given the price, I expected the different inputs to feel cheap, but that’s mostly not the case. The face buttons aren’t quite as good, being fractionally raised from the unit’s main body, and the travel feels ever so slightly too long, but they still do a decent job of responding to your inputs in games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Kid Chameleon.</p>
<p>The two analogue sticks are laid out asymmetrically, and for some people, this will be a sticking point. While it’s aping the Xbox or Nintendo Switch layouts, it does mean that the D-pad is at the bottom of the unit. Depending on how you hold the device, the size of your hands and the games you’re playing, this could make it uncomfortable over long gaming sessions. They’re also pretty short and soft, without much feedback, but they are there, which isn’t always the case for retro-focused devices. It means that you can properly control Dreamcast and later PlayStation 1 games, without having to resort to swapping the D-pad’s functionality, and that’s a big bonus for me.</p>

<p>The other controls are solid, with digital shoulder buttons that wrap around the top corners of the R36H, and two further inputs on top which are easily reachable with the tips of your fingers. Most retro games won’t use both sets, but they’re solid and useable if you need to call on them.</p>
<p>We’re here for retro gaming, and thankfully the R36H allows you to do that, and it does an especially good job with older titles from the 16-bit era and below. I love a good shoot ‘em up, and Aeroblaster – or Air Busters depending on where you played it – remains one of my all-time favourites. Here it runs flawlessly in its Arcade rendition, with a decent frame rate, and unspectacular but well-represented audio. This is retro gaming running through imperfect emulators, so support isn’t going to be perfect across the board – I found audio issues in the arcade Mortal Kombat games that weren’t present in other games, for example – so if you’re coming at this as your first entry into the hobby, don’t expect everything in your ROM collection to work straight out of the box.</p>
<p>The speakers on the R36H aren’t great. They’re thin-sounding, firing downwards into your hands and relying on how you place your palms to get the best audio, but they do have plenty of volume. That volume is controlled by two digital buttons on the top of the unit, and there is a 3.5mm socket for a wired headphone connection, which is the best way to hear your favourite game themes. I’ve been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Tactics, and the soundtrack sounded great when playing on the R36H with headphones – it’s definitely my recommended way to play.</p>

For Hire</a> evokes the classic cartoons of the 1930s in its rubberhose animation style, but it’s a first-person shooter at its core. That means it’s all about the guns, of which we’ve largely only seen era-specific firearms like Tommy guns and pistols. A new trailer reveals three more off-the-wall weapons that lean much more into the absurdity of Mouse’s cartoon world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up is a freeze weapon called the COOL-D Cold Steam Applier, which can encase foes in ice, which you can shatter with a stiff kick. The CLEAN-D Automatic Turpentine Cleanse is a chemical weapon firing Turpentine that melts foes on contact. Lastly, you can scramble enemy brains with the MIND-D Self-Aware Attitude Changer. This mind-warping beam causes the target to go insane to the point that their head explodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nt4dqP9wtQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>First revealed in 2023, Mouse: P.I. For Hire stars Jack Pepper, a detective and war hero who becomes embroiled in a mystery within the criminal underworld of the city of Mouseberg. The Noir-inspired adventure lets players blast through non-linear levels using a variety of ranged and melee weapons and power-ups, like a Popeye-inspired spinach boost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire launches this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

<p>As a member of the Black Spider Clan, Kumori combines modern weaponry with demonic power to take down threats. She most prominently wields twin daggers to slice apart foes up close, but she can also toss them to hold back distant threats. See Kumori in action in the game’s new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1X0Ot401Tk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was announced last December during The Game Awards and is being helmed by Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen and published by Dotemu (TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4). Ragebound canonically takes place immediately after the conclusion of the original Ninja Gaiden for NES. Ryu Hayabusa has left his village to avenge his father, leaving a new playable hero and upstart Hayabusa Clan ninja, Kenji Mozu, to protect his home from a demonic threat.</p>

<p>The 2D action features optional side quests, upgradable abilities, and secret collectibles. Naturally, it will also sport the series' signature (or infamous) precision-based, skill-demanding platforming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound launches this summer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be the second of three Ninja Gaiden releases in 2025, following Ninja Gaiden II Black in January and before the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4 later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction on Switch 2 will support the Friend's Pass</a>, which allows owners to invite a friend to play with them for free. It will also have Cross Play, meaning a Switch 2 player can enjoy the co-op capers of Mio and Zoe with those on PC, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>And welcomely, it will also be able to be enjoyed by those on the OG Switch, even though the game isn't launching on the platform.</p>

<p>This little nugget was casually tucked away in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/nintendo-switch-2-features">Split Fiction blog post</a> about Switch 2's features. "GameShare will enable Nintendo Switch 2 owners to invite another player to play together over a local wireless connection using just one copy of the game," the post reads.</p>
<p>"This 'other player' can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well."</p>
<p>Well, I'll be, that is pretty neat! Perhaps it isn't a surprise to many, but I will admit I just assumed that Split Fiction would only be playable for those using an available release platform.</p>

<p>Nintendo gamers are really in for a treat, I have to say. Split Fiction is absolutely brilliant! And, I am far from the only one to think so. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on Switch 2 on the console's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">which is 5th June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Atomfall surpassed Rebellion's expectations by far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaching over two million players in just one month</a>, and its presence on Game Pass was definitely helpful toward that goal. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley heaped praise on Microsoft and their subscription service:</p>
<p><em>It's been a huge success. Microsoft has been a fantastic partner to work with, they've really leaned in to helping us. They brought their skills and their scale to bear on our small project, and it's done really, really well for them, so they got a good deal, we got a good deal out of it as well.</em></p>
<p><em>With Game Pass, you can get people to try it, then as a result of those people trying it, they like it, and they then tell their mates on social media, 'I found this game on Game Pass, I really enjoyed it, you should have a go.' And then some of them are on Game Pass, and will play it. But some of them aren't on Game Pass, and will also want to be part of that conversation. So, they'll go and buy it. </em><em>At least, that's our theory – we don't have the data in for that. But Chris and I both feel, one of the biggest challenges for a company like us is discovery. And Game Pass has allowed for a lot of discovery for our game.</em></p>
<p><em>It does mitigate risk, because without going into details, they guarantee you a certain level of income, regardless of what it will sell for. But it potentially has a knock-on effect. Places like Xbox sales, for example. You could argue that all the hardcore are on Game Pass, and they're the ones that might buy a new IP like this, so therefore, are you cannibalising one section of the audience? And I think, perhaps, yes, a little bit. But what you gain from that cost is disproportionate.</em></p>

            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.
</p>

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tabletop Tavern is, currently, not quite where it needs to be to properly scratch that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> itch. The units can be a bit flaky, charges lack impact, and there's just not enough to do to keep early battles interesting. What is it, however, is a great concept with a lot of personality: you're playing actual tabletop miniatures inside a medieval tavern, gradually building up your army across Slay The Spire style branching progression nodes. I'm absolutely rooting for it, simply because there's still so little offering a comparable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> experience to Total War, and also because it's made by a solo dev. Trailer below, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337380/Tabletop_Tavern/">here's a Steam demo</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when the world was young, god still loved us, and no-one was trying to force AI assistants into my toothbrush, Warhammer makers Games Workshop had the absolutely wild idea that building a community might actually help them sell a few toys, and so used to host regular games in stores. It's the sort of thing you have to find a club these days for mostly, but that's the framing here: you've settled in for a bit of wargaming and a pint of ale or six in your local tavern.</p>
<p>A lot of the controls will be immediately familiar to Total War players - the Ctrl-Alt-drag formation shift even makes an appearance, as do the little triangles to denote individual units within formations. Much like Total War, you've got your rock-paper-scissors infantry-cavalry-ranged archetypes, along with different types of terrain and weather. Pikeman have an anti-large bonus, shielded units are handy at blocking missiles, and so on. But it's also just far less gloomy than Warhammer in general, with classic blinding green flock mats and notably less screaming about how Sigmar has abandoned us.</p>
<p>Again, it needs some work - there's not much impact feedback, and so things feel a little limp. Plus, the gradual army building of the roguelike structure means early skirmishes are quite similar. Still, the events between battles to restore unit health or perhaps recruit a few bonus mates are a great touch, and I'm eager to see how this one develops. Between this and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">Strategos</a>, it's always good to see more games giving Creative Assembly a friendly poke out of complete complacency. Throw in an army painter, and I'm yours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the biggest technical surprises when it comes to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console was that it would support features like HDR (High Dynamic Range displays) and VRR (Variable Refresh Rate). However, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted by a ResetEra user</a>, any mention of VRR being available when setting the console in docked (or TV) mode has been removed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canadian</a> websites.</p>
<p>The description used to say:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR, VRR, and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>Now, though, it has been modified to:</p>
<p><em>Take in all the detail with screen resolutions up to 4K when you connect the Nintendo Switch 2 system to a compatible TV using the dedicated dock. The system also supports HDR and frame rates up to 120 fps on compatible TVs.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-More-details-about-features-2790188.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British website</a> still features the original description, hence the confusion. Needless to say, we'll reach out to Nintendo to try and get clarification on the subject. It would be very underwhelming if docked mode truly lacked variable refresh rate, which would be critical for a smooth gameplay experience when playing at 4K on the console.</p>
<p>This does not affect handheld mode, which has built-in NVIDIA G-SYNC through a native DisplayPort 1.4 connection. The speculation is that variable refresh rate might be lost in the conversion from DisplayPort to the HDMI output needed for docked mode.</p>
<p>In other slightly weird Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-do-not-support-cloud-saves.1166340/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neither The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild nor The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will support the cloud save backup feature</a> that is included with the Nintendo Switch Online premium membership. To clarify, it will still be possible to transfer saves from the original Nintendo Switch, but users won't be able to create new cloud saves in these versions.</p>

            <p>It's soon bank holiday weekend for us in the UK, which means I'll be doing two things: sleeping and eating. Maybe I'll eat a duvet or two! Who knows. Four days with no imposed structure is enough time for things to <em>get weird</em>. Maybe I'll eat your duvet! No. Not again. Have to calm down.  I'll simply distract myself with the "culinary quest" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hungry-horrors">Hungry Horrors</a> - a game that, I must admit, I'm mainly drawn to because I'm not sure I've ever seen Yorkshire Pudding employed as an upgrade before.</p>

<p>If you hadn't noticed from all the pickled eggs, shortbread, and some sort of regional abomination called 'Toad In <em><strong>A</strong></em> Hole'? (literally unplayable), Hungry Horrors takes influence from British and Irish folklore and what they're calling 'authentic regional dishes'. I'm yet to spot my own authentic regional dish, the Super Noodle sandwich, but it's not too late. The idea is that you'll serve food to folkloric creatures to stop them snacking on you instead. Each creature has their own preferences, whether that be a yen for sweet food or a dislike for fish, and you'll have to work out what these are.</p>
<p>It's roguelikely in structure, and you'll return to your base after each run to try out new recipes. Here's a little more from the Steam page, which also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048840/Hungry_Horrors/">houses a demo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Meet Black Annis, Jenny Greenteeth, Grendel, and other legendary beings straight from Celtic, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh legends. Each creature you encounter has been terrifying the people of these lands for centuries, challenging you to outwit their monstrous appetites".</p></blockquote>
<p>Dev team hungry horrors recently got caught in pickle of their own, having to <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html">evacuate the Bangkok apartment they were living and working in</a> following the Myanmar earthquake. Given the circumstances, I suppose I can forgive 'Toad In A Hole', although just barely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer said it was true</a>, and they've got an uncle that works at the White Gold Tower, although prodding Bethesda themselves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">proved as forthcoming</a> as trying to get stones out of a blood orange.</p>

<p>If you've been following all this, you may have noticed that the timing of the remaster's (or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">remake's</a>?) release is a little bit, um, <em>convenient</em>. The team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a> - a full remake of Oblivion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine - is also due to release this year. While it's obviously tempting to frame this as the monstrous cads at Bethesda n' chums taking a power-hose grade widdle on the dreams, work, beds, and pets of volunteer modders, it seems the modders themselves aren't too bothered.</p>
<p>"The real remake is the friends we made along the way," says <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912137244036522179">Skyblivion lead KRebel</a>. "This changes nothing for me. This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community its a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster."</p>
<p>This echo earlier statements made to our <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remaster-leak-skyblivion-project-lead-stay-positive">network chums at VG247</a>. "I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined, friends, experience and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry which I ended up doing," KRebel said. "At the end of the day it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all."</p>
<p>And that's the key point here, I think. The official remaster has presumably been in the works for many years at this point. Bethesda knew it was coming, and still allowed the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> team to carry on doing their thing. The result? Well, it means we've all got a more bucolic Tamriel to visit when the official version's seemingly ubiquitous 2005 shooter piss-filter gets too much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
