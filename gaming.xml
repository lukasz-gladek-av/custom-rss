			<p>Arcadia Bay is all but a forgotten memory for some. Washed away in a brutal storm, the town that Max Caulfield, Chloe Price, and so many others called home has simply ceased to be. Now, years after those traumatic memories have finally subsided, Max is ready to pick things back up and start a new life in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Square-Enix invited us to take an early look at the first two chapters of <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> in their entirety. This will be the same Early Access that owners of the Ultimate Edition will gain access to starting on October 15th, a full two weeks ahead of the five-chapter game's full release.</p>
<p>Max Caulfield is certainly making a name for herself as a promising student at Caledon University, having won a number of awards and a residency through the prestigious school's art programs. Take one step into the Fine Arts Building that serves as a central hub for students and faculty to bump into each other over a quick cup of coffee and you'll see Max's photos all over the place as part of an art exhibit. This version of Max Caulfield has taken her past trauma and turned it into a form of self-expression through the photos she routinely takes. This is a Max whose time traveling and bending days are behind her and she's simply trying to enjoy a normal life once more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Normal for Max Caulfield is rarely that. She hasn't quite grown out of her snarky self-talking phase, so if you were one to mute the TV while rummaging through the various knickknacks of Max's bedroom, you'll find no quarter here. Cute double entendre have instead been replaced with banter that's practically oozing with sexual tension, whether it's with the cute bartender who Max has a crush on, the administrative assistant who by and large feels like a grease ball no matter how much they try to humanize him and his faults, and the various other university fellows around.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure centers around her relationships with a couple of close friends primarily: an up-and-coming poet named Safi Llewelyn-Fayyad whose mother is the President of Caledon University and Moses, a young astronomer whose dreams are in the stars. Amidst a meteor shower and quiet gathering on the school's roof, Safi breaks from the group for a short while. In this time, she is tragically gunned down and left in the snow for Max and Moses to discover. It's this pivotal moment that serves as the crux for Life is Strange: Double Exposure's narrative.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Those rewind powers that served Max so well in her first story have since atrophied and can no longer be relied upon. Instead, through perhaps a gift of the meteor shower or her own sheer determination to try and change the past, Max discovers that rather than moving to a previous time, her powers have grown to allow her to tear open a rift and travel to an alternate timeline: one where Safi is still alive.</p>
<p>Much of Life is Strange: Double Exposure's gameplay hinges on this dual-world mechanic. Venturing into a timeline where Safi is still alive is not quite a perfect world either, as the relationships that the various residents of Caledon University are strained in various ways. A character who might be the nurturing type in one timeline might have a fractured homelife in another. In the world were Safi has passed, many of the residents have instead turned to coping mechanics such as alcohol and the downfall that slowly builds.</p>
<figure>

<p>Early on, not much can be done with this newfound power in Life is Strange: Double Exposure. It starts initially with an ability to peer into the other world, seeing ghostly afterimages of people walking by or catch snippets of conversations on the wind. However, Max soon discovers that she can affect both timelines at once by carrying objects from one world into the other. This mechanic is largely used in the second chapters for menial items, such as keys and email printouts, but quickly grows as the demo comes to a close. While being unable to rewind loses a lot of its immediate potential, this world-shifting power might be the key to unraveling Safi's death in one world and preventing it in the other.</p>
<p>All in all, I left my time at Caledon University quite impressed with how they were able to show Max Caulfield's personal growth while giving players one more chance to go on a wild adventure with her. Even though Dontnod have already stepped away from the series early on, I have faith that Deck Nine and Square-Enix can do right by bringing Max Caulfield's story to an eventual close.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox Game Studios head Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of next month, and Rare head Craig Duncan is apparently set to take his place.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz article</a>, which cites an internal email sent to Xbox staff by studio boss Matt Booty. In that email, Booty celebrates Hartman's "innovation, dedication, and...unwavering passion for gaming".</p>
<p>As he points out, Hartman's career with Microsoft began as a contractor in 1988, and he would go on to work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>,&nbsp;as well as being included in the credits of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=_W6bMg1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=UZax8DOq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alan Hartman's illustrious career includes work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Forza</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hartman was also involved in the founding of&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10, which was established back in 2001 to steward the racing franchise.</p>
<p>He would go on to become Turn 10's studio manager in 2005, a position in which he served all the way up until 2023, when he was made the head of Xbox Game Studios (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-studios-rebranded-as-xbox-game-studios">rebranded from Microsoft Studios back in 2019</a>) after former position holder Matt Booty was promoted.</p>
<p>All told, this means Hartman will have served as Xbox Game Studios head for just over a year at the point of his retirement, which isn't a bad innings.</p>
<p>Hartman's replacement, Craig Duncan, is the current studio head of Microsoft subsidiary Rare, a position he's held since 2011. His appointment makes a lot of sense given that Rare is a Microsoft studio, as well as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuing success</a> of Rare's live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-thieves-rare-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=2t9-hNXG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-thieves-rare-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=CtC289uT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Craig Duncan has been the head of Rare since 2011, where he's overseen games like&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether Duncan's appointment will result in any kind of concrete change in terms of Xbox Game Studios' strategy remains to be seen, but the label has a number of games on the horizon, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> and Obsidian's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avowed">first-person RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em></a>.</p>
<p>Duncan also inherits a number of subsidiary studios under the Xbox label, including&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts&nbsp;</em>developer Double Fine,&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>studio Playground Games, and Hartman's former stomping ground Turn 10.</p>

After more than 30 years at Microsoft, Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of November.&nbsp;</p><p>Alan’s career has been marked by innovation, dedication, and an unwavering passion for gaming. Starting as a contractor at Microsoft in the fledgling CD-ROM group in 1988, Alan has worked on a variety of projects in his time here, from Age of Empires, to Brute Force as the studio head of Digital Anvil, to the founding of Turn 10. Over the years, Alan, Turn 10 and Playground Games delivered 13 Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon games, building Forza into one of the top racing franchises in the world and regularly pushing the capabilities of our hardware. His work to advance accessibility in gaming has set a benchmark for the industry and under his leadership, Xbox Game Studios has shipped multiple critically acclaimed titles this year and set the stage for highly anticipated games like Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>When seeking our next leader to navigate the complexities of our business and foster the creativity needed for our games to thrive, we collaborated with HR to evaluate both external and internal candidates, considering the unique demands of the XGS role.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that Craig Duncan will assume the role of Head of Xbox Game Studios. Craig brings a wealth of experience from his tenure at Codemasters, Midway Games, and Sumo Digital before joining Xbox in 2011 to lead Rare. During this time, Rare has achieved sustained business success and developed new IP, most notably the ever-evolving Sea of Thieves, a cross-platform franchise with over 40 million players.</p><p>In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP. Craig will report to me and join the Game Content and Studios leadership team, working closely with Alan during the transition. The existing XGS leadership team Alan established will remain intact and report to Craig.&nbsp;</p><p>I am also pleased to announce that Joe Neate and Jim Horth will take over as co-leads of Rare. Their leadership has played a crucial role in Rare’s growth, and I am confident they will elevate the studio and its games to even greater heights.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Alan on his retirement and welcoming Craig, Joe, and Jim into their new roles.</p><p>Matt</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!--more-->
<p>As a pair of scratchy, black-and white intertitles explain, you are Sadie, an aspiring actress and stuntwoman denied a fair shot at making it in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Sadie’s solution, apparently, is just to peg it stage left, bounding through an entire weekend marathon’s worth of film sets and increasingly hazardous prop warehouses.</p>

</figure>
<p>As a platformer, it’s functional and slickly animated, if only about as deep as Charlie Chaplin’s hat. Its dedication to the silent movie bit, however, is bound to raise a smile. Besides the black-and-white film look, and the fact that Sadie starts doing the Charleston if you set your controller down for a while, the big highlight is the use of sound. In place of realistic action noises, Sadie’s traversal moves are synced with little period-appropriate instrumental flourishes. Twiddly strings accompany rope grabs, their pitch playfully creeping higher with successive swings, and hard landings produce a bassy drum roll to emphasise the timeless slapstick quality of falling on one’s arse. It’s not a rhythm game but when you’re successfully stringing together jumps and slides, there is a keenly satisfying sense that you’re playing the lead in a twenties flick <em>and</em> composing the score at the same time.</p><p>There’s also an attention to detail that really helps breathe some life into these plywood gauntlets. Stagehands and set designers go to work around you, putting the finishing touches to their fake Western/pirate/farmyard scenes, while forklift drivers cart their crates through the studio backlots. Even the static environments have character, especially a series of background billboards through which their Prohibition-era renters struggle to make water sound interesting.</p>

</figure>
<p>Later on, the platforming gives way to some stealthing, with mixed success. It seriously slows down the pace, completely abandoning that flowing musical platforming in favour of forcing you to hide in cupboards from lumbering patrols. Still, the introduction of a barrel disguise – like you’re a flapper Solid Snake – does reintroduce the comedy aspect, and there’s still a dash of dynamic audio cleverness, as going into sneak mode lowers the jaunty swing soundtrack to a simple, slinking piano melody.</p>
<p>There’s no release date for Silent Sadie as of yet, though I can recommend this Next Fest demo right now. Even if the actual platforming part isn’t all that groundbreaking, the strength of its presentation and the charm of its affectionate 1920s pastiche go a long way in giving it a unique and likeable character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has announced a new head of Xbox Game Studios. Rare studio head Craig Duncan will be leaving his position to take over as Head of Xbox Game Studios.</p>



<p>The move comes as current head of Xbox Game Studios, Alan Hartman, has announced his retirement at the end of November. He held his position as studios head since October 2023. </p>



<p>Duncan comes in after leading Rare since February 2011 where he oversaw the development of Sea of Thieves along with other titles like Battletoads, Killer Instinct, and various Kinect titles at the studio. Prior to Rare, Duncan was a director at Codemasters and studio head at Midway Games.</p>



<p>In a memo to staff via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, president of Game Content and Studios Matt Booty thanked Hartman for his years of dedication and service to the industry and Xbox. He then touched on what Duncan will focus on moving forward.</p>



<p>“In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP,” Booty said.</p>



<p>Taking over for Duncan at Rare will be Joe Neate and Jim Horth. Neate has been the executive producer of Sea of Thieves while Horth has spent over 20 years at Rare.</p>



<p>Currently, Rare is still regularly developing and releasing updates for Sea of Thieves. The studio is also working on the upcoming action-adventure game Everwild.</p>

The news has led to confusion, with some buyers seeking clarification from Argos' customer support.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reports from those who reached out to Argos have been mixed. While some customer service representatives have indicated the <a href="https://x.com/AndrewLostTime/status/1845815095021957410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellation emails were sent in error</a>, others have confirmed that the <a href="https://x.com/Matoh543/status/1845820655742161264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellations are legitimate</a>, leaving buyers uncertain about the status of their orders.</p><p>This isn't the first bit of trouble the PS5 30th Anniversary that customers have run into.

A second wave of preorders was made available through major retailers like Amazon, Argos, and Very on October 10, but these sold out just as quickly. Now, Argos seems to be reversing some of those orders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Those who made preorders are unsurprisingly frustrated by the situation. <a href="https://x.com/Natty301288/status/1845807344627695996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Natty301288 on Twitter/X</a> stating: "@ArgosHelpers is this a joke preorder made last Thursday confirmation received now can’t get this elsewhere"</p><p>The sentiment was shared by user <a href="https://x.com/Malik_Zain7/status/1845813886215164034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Malik_Zain7</a>, exclaiming: "@Argos_Online this some kind of joke???<br>After taking payment for a limited edition console and also sending me a confirmation email, you’re now saying it’s cancelled?"</p><p>For further updates on the situation, follow our deals team at <a href="https://x.com/IGNUKDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IGNUKDeals</a> on Twitter/X, who are closely monitoring the cancellations and other preorder developments.</p><p>The reason behind the cancellations remains unclear, though <a href="https://x.com/Natty301288/status/1845827645780476118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overselling of stock is a likely explanation</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-is-a-metroid-hades-hybrid-soaked-in-neon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For a small, independent studio, Bithell Games really doesn’t like to be pigeonholed. The studio began life as a one-man band and released its debut puzzler Thomas Was Alone to critical acclaim. In the 12 years since, the studio has grown and experimented, tackling genres like stealth, strategy, point-and-click adventure, and even visual novels. For its next project it’s going even bigger, and Tron: Catalyst is an action-adventure with a scope and ambition far greater than anything the studio has done before.</p><p>Of course, it’s not the first time the studio has worked on the Tron franchise and 2023’s Tron: Identity was a fresh spin on the movie series. Tron: Catalyst is set in the same world as Identity and features an all-new story, but it’s the action-focussed gameplay that piqued my interest the most when I recently sat through a 30-minute hands-off demo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Playing as Exo, a courier who’s been swept up in a conspiracy and is now on the run, Catalyst reminded me a little of Hades. It has a similar 3D isometric viewpoint and the action flows thick and fast. Showcasing the combat was the aim of the demo and, equipped with the infamous Identity disc, Exo fought multiple enemies at the same time. Melee attacks – slamming the disc in the face of the nearest enemy – is the foundation on which combat is built, but the disc can be used as a ranged weapon too, throwing it like a frisbee to target distant enemies. Additionally, the disc can be ricocheted off surfaces and even other enemies, to string together combos, or it can be thrown past a target so it catches them on the rebound, pulling them nearer so you can finish them off with a close-up sucker punch. It’s fast and satisfying, and of course, it’s all drenched in neon so it feels <em>very</em> Tron. </p><p>“The goal is to hit all the Tron verbs, to enable players to do everything they would want to do in a Tron movie, and to do them in an interesting way,” explains creative director Mike Bithell. Of course, if you think of Tron you automatically think of its iconic Light Cycle, which is a core part of Catalyst. It is by far the fastest way to explore the city, at least at ground level, but it’s also useful in combat and side-swiping a bunch of enemies while doing a donut looks like a lot of fun.</p><p>That said, verticality is a key part of the city’s design so often you need to explore on foot. There are high rises to climb, buildings to infiltrate and roofs to parkour over, and there’s a fluidity to the way it all flows together. Exo is able to run and vault over obstacles seamlessly, and can even combo an attack if there’s an enemy on the other side of a wall. Indeed, Bithell says Tron: Catalyst has a deep upgrade tree and that both your combat and traversal skills can be buffed to improve your ability to fight and move quickly around the environment. “Some of the upgrades happen through story moments, plus you can also earn XP by collecting green data shards to upgrade too”, says Bithell. “There are also other layers to the upgrade tree I cannot talk about now, but the idea is to constantly give the player a constant stream of new stuff to play with.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even though Catalyst tells a separate story from Legacy, it’s mindful of everything that has come before and indeed is coming later</p></div><p>Interestingly, the Light Cycle cannot be upgraded because the studio wanted players to be able to use it to its full ability right from the start rather than having to wait, but the way you navigate around does change over time as shortcuts are unlocked.</p><p>These are revealed as part of bigger ‘glitches’ in the game, which are effectively gameplay loops you can use to your advantage. Although the exact nature of these loops isn’t clear right now, the demo reveals that they roll back time, meaning you’re able to revisit locations you’ve been to before, but with equipment you picked up later in the game. It’s a nod to Metroidvanias and I’m interested to see how big a part it plays in the finished game, especially because Bithell says the loops are used in different ways throughout and that there are puzzles that can only be solved by using the glitch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tron: Catalyst First Screens</h3></div></output><p>One thing we are unlikely to see in Tron: Catalyst is boss fights, or at least not many of them. “There will be boss fights but it’s not a massive focus for the game”, admits Bithell. “The combat is really built around fighting multiple enemies at the same time; it’s about making each individual enemy interesting but also the intersection of different enemies together interesting too – how they work together and how the overlaps feel. There are multiple factions in the game so that plays into it too.”</p><p>We know nothing about the factions Bithell speaks of but one thing is for sure – Tron: Catalyst is a canon entry in the Tron universe and takes place after Legacy, but is set on a different Grid, one that has been left alone for decades. “I wanted to explore the idea of what would happen if you left those programs to their own devices, and what would happen if that grid starts to break apart and glitch”, explains Bithell. Even though Catalyst tells a separate story from Legacy, it’s mindful of everything that has come before and indeed is coming later, when the third movie, Tron: Ares, releases next year.</p><p>Working with Disney and the people behind the movies to ensure authenticity is something Bithell relishes highly. It’s something he first explored with John Wick Hex, which released five years ago, and is now something he actively looks forward to. “I absolutely love learning opportunities and getting the chance to work with the people who make the things I love,” he admits. “I’ve been able to talk and learn from them, so much so there are action scenes [in Tron] that I’ve put together after learning from the best stunt teams in the world. With Tron, I’ve been able to learn from artists, writers, designers, directors of previous Tron media… You can’t pay for an education like that.”</p><p><em>Alex Simmons is IGN's Features Director.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Craig Duncan, the head of Microsoft studio Rare, will become the new head of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> as current boss Alan Hartman retires.</p>
<p>Duncan has been studio head at Rare since 2011, overseeing the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> and multiple Kinect games.</p>
<p>Hartman, meanwhile, became head of Xbox Game Studios last year following almost 17 years as studio head at Forza developer Turn 10 and a further two years as corporate vice president of Forza and Fable at Microsoft.</p>

<p>As head of Xbox Game Studios, Duncan will oversee projects from the likes of Rare and Turn 10, as well as Playground Games, Ninja Theory, The Initiative, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">newly named Halo Studios</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Back at Rare, Duncan will be replaced by Joe Neate and Jim Horth. Neate has led Sea of Thieves as executive producer, while Horth has worked at Rare for over 20 years - most recently as studio director.</p>
<p>"Alan's career has been marked by innovation, dedication, and an unwavering passion for gaming," wrote Xbox president of game content and studios Matt Booty in an email to staff (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires">GI.Biz</a>).</p>
<p>"Starting as a contractor at Microsoft in the fledgling CD-ROM group in 1988, Alan has worked on a variety of projects in his time here, from Age of Empires, to Brute Force as the studio head of Digital Anvil, to the founding of Turn 10. Over the years, Alan, Turn 10 and Playground Games delivered 13 Forza Motorsport and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> games, building Forza into one of the top racing franchises in the world and regularly pushing the capabilities of our hardware. His work to advance accessibility in gaming has set a benchmark for the industry and under his leadership, Xbox Game Studios has shipped multiple critically acclaimed titles this year and set the stage for highly anticipated games like Avowed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Fable, and more."</p>
<p>On Duncan's position, he wrote: "In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP."</p>
<p>Rare has been working on its next project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-now-targeting-2024-release-report">Everwild</a>, for quite some time now, which was pencilled in for a 2024 release back in 2021. That now seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sea of Thieves was released on PS5 earlier this year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">quickly hit 1m copies sold</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To make the confusion worse, some customers who got in touch with Argos' customer support were told the emails had been sent "in error", with several receiving assurances from the retailer that their orders had "not been cancelled" and were still scheduled to be delivered at the end of November.</p>
<p>But at the same time, other customers were informed that "all cancellations are correct", with Argos apologising for "any inconvenience caused".</p> <div>

<p>Whilst it's unclear how many customers have been affected, a Argos representative told one customer that "as this is a mass cancellation, it is taking time for some orders to update to cancelled. Refunds are being processed as we speak".</p>
<p>"The annoying thing is that we've missed the opportunity to buy elsewhere thinking our orders were confirmed," <a href="https://x.com/FPL_Boots/status/1845823445440872944">said</a> one unhappy pre-orderer.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't have to preorder from multiple shops to stand a chance of getting something in case of cancellations."</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m always in awe at the dedication that long-running Japanese game developer Nihon Falcom has for their legacy series like The Legend of Heroes and Ys. Most game franchises this long in the tooth might have gone through some reboots or massive changes in style or direction at this point, but not Ys. This series is a lot like Final Fantasy in how each entry can update and reinvent itself, but each game still features the same protagonist Adol Christin and the same sort of high-fantasy, treasure-hunting vibe that the series is so closely tied to. Well, all except for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-review/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a>, which shot for a wildly different tone and atmosphere that was honestly a welcome change of pace. While Ys X: Nordics introduces just as many meaningful changes to the formula, it ends up coming a lot closer to being the sort of bright and vivid expedition adventure that the franchise has been known for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys X: Nordics - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC) (EU - English)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ob0w-Wi9Nc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics technically takes place after the second entry in the series, but that only matters if you’re a diehard fan analysing every crumb of minor NPC dialogue for hints of lore like a rabid fanboy tying the various Legend of Zelda timelines together. This is essentially a standalone adventure about a young swordsman named Adol who gets himself roped up in some trouble while hitching a sea-fairing ride on a large ship.</p>


<p>A raiding party of Normans arrive, who are a very 11th century viking-inspired clan of peoples, and Adol soon finds out that the ship he’s on is helmed by bandits and that the raiding Normans are actually just protecting their village. After arriving on land and making camp with the Normans, Adol finds himself mysteriously stuck to their princess leader Karja Balta by a mysterious glowing chain – kicking off a series of events that sees Adol involved in a mysterious, ancestral battle involving undying creatures, clashing clans and more.</p>


<p>While I was impressed by the story of Ys IX, I felt like it didn’t hit the mark as well with the character-specific writing and little moments of interaction and bonding between the crew. I feel like I walked away from my time with Ys X: Nordics with the opposite feeling. This game has some of my favorite character writing and interactions in the whole franchise. Adol and Karja bounce off each other so well, and despite every game in the series throwing a new temporary ally into Adol’s arms, Karja is one of the rare ones who feels like such a perfect foil and companion to Adol’s energy and vibe that I wish she would become a series mainstay going forward.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the overarching story didn’t do much to impress me. A lot of big moments kind of happen for the sake of happening, and the overall adventure ends up feeling less like a grandiose emotional adventure and more of a flashy and silly anime-fueled action romp.</p>

<p>If anything, that sometimes mindless story helps put you onto the rails for some of the most fun combat the Ys series has ever had. The last few entries in the series had you controlling a party of three characters with different weapon types, swapping between them in real-time depending on the weakness of the enemy you were facing. Ys X: Nordics does away with the weapon weaknesses and the three-person party – instead, you only play as Adol and Karja, and you play as them at pretty much the same exact time.</p>
<p>Now, your main gameplay focus is building combos by linking your special attacks together, but using the same special attack twice in a row kills your combo, and certain special attacks drain way more SP for the character who used it than others might. You quickly fall into a rhythm of not only swapping between each character’s unique sets of skills, but also building up to your strongest attacks by first using weaker ones so you can extend your combo, give your meter time to charge, and effectively deal with your enemies. It’s an incredible change that adds more agency and thoughtfulness to the combat than there’s been in this series for ages.</p>

<p>The other major gameplay wrinkle in Ys X: Nordics is the ship exploration and combat. In the same vein as a AAAA game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/skull-and-bones-review/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>, you can navigate a seafaring vessel across the massive amount of oceans and small bodies of land that make up the expansive world of the game. It isn’t quite open-world in terms of scale, but there’s far more to see and explore than I was expecting.</p>
<p>For the first few chapters, though, your ship is kind of boring. It’s slow, and it doesn’t have much in the way of firepower, but as you progress through the game and do things like tackling the enemy fortresses or deal with side quests you’ll quickly upgrade your arsenal and ship capabilities. There’s some clunkiness to the way your ship handles that I imagine could be ironed out in a future entry, but it’s still a fun enough distraction to help tie the otherwise pretty linear dungeon encounters together.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ys X: Nordics maintains a lot of the qualities that this series has come to be known for. Some of those qualities aren't necessarily a positive, like the familiarly linear dungeon encounters and the less-than-impressive visuals of the game, but a lot of it works great. Combat is the best it's ever been, naval gameplay is a fresh and welcome addition, and Ys X: Nordics introduces refreshing character moments with Adol and Karja that I'm desperate to see more of in the next entry.	</p></div>

			<p>Disney TRON: Catalyst is a brand new action-adventure game that will be launching on PC and consoles in 2025. This game is developed by Big Fan Games, a subsidiary of Devolver Digital, alongside Bithell Games in collaboration with Disney Games. This story-driven isometric title will be taking place in TRON's world, with the game acting as a continuation of the Arq Grid story, which was introduced in TRON: Identity, a game created by Bithell Games that was released in 2023. For those eager to jump into the futuristic cult classic world of TRON once more, the game will be launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p>The Arq Grid is just about on the brink of collapse, and you are in charge of figuring out why and how to resolve the issue. In the sequel to TRON: Identity, players will get to play as Exo, where you'll be in charge of battling on-foot while using your Identity Disc and piloting your Light Cycle to try and complete missions as well as obtain information that will help you advance on your quest. Exo is a multi-faceted character, and players will get to see her learn from her mistakes as she tries to complete her quest and navigate the warring factions to uncover new paths and secrets of the Arq Grid while harnessing the power of the Glitch loop.</p>
<p>Exo can initiate time loops and is in charge of using the time loops to manipulate time and space to fight back against the overlords of a crumbling Grid. While this is happening, Exo has to try to evade Conn, the main enemy in the game, who is a dangerous agent of CORE. Exo has to harness her abilities to be able to uncover the 'Glitch' that is currently threatening the grid in TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney TRON: Catalyst - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvDOAkbemRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Original music from the TRON universe will be a feature, and the game features hand-drawn art to give it that personal touch. To celebrate the announcement of the game, Big Fan Games has released a trailer in just over one minute that will show off some of the art, action, and story that players can expect to jump into when the game releases in 2025. Below is the trailer, giving those excited TRON fans a sneak peek into the future.</p>
<p>For those who don't know much about Bithell Games, they are a small indie team that was founded in 2013. They were created after the success of Thomas Was Alone, the project made by <a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">Mike Bithell</a>, Creative Director. Since then, there have been games such as John Wick Hex, Volume, and, more recently, TRON: Identity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tron-catalyst-mike-bithell-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mike Bithell and Devolver Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst</em>, an "isometric story-driven action game" set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>that's coming to PC and consoles next year.</p>
<p>The game, which will be released through Devolver's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies">new Big Fan label</a>, will combine "electrifying action and a rich story" set in what Bithell calls "the immersive and diverse locations of the Arq Grid".</p>
<p>You might recognize that term if you've played Bithell Games' previous&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>, a visual novel released last year that first introduced the Arq Grid to the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tron-catalyst-bithell-light-cycle.jpg?itok=JzmZ8Axo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tron-catalyst-bithell-light-cycle.jpg?itok=2ETP1k9d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mike Bithell is working on another game set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Tron</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>You play as Exo, a "highly resilient and resourceful program" armed with a power known as the Glitch. Using that power, you must battle your way through the Arq Grid, dealing with the sinister machinations of malevolent AI Conn as you go.</p>
<p>Bithell is promising a "dynamic combat system" that will allow you to engage in both melee and ranged combat, and you'll also have access to one of the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>franchise's iconic Light Cycles, which you can also use to do battle.</p>
<p>As you explore the Arq Grid, you'll also be able to uncover "secret areas and shortcuts" using Exo's Glitch ability, which can help you see "system level time loops" caused by sinister Glitches.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>launch trailer, which shows off some of the ways in which Bithell's game captures the clean, moody cyberpunk aesthetic of&nbsp;<em>Tron</em>, right here.</p>

<p>Mike Bithell's previous games include the likes of tactical action game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/john-wick-hex"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>, narrative-focused visual novel&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-bithell-announces-and-releases-quarantine-circular"><em>Quarantine Circular</em></a>, and futuristic card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-bithell-short-solitaire-conspiracy-announced-for-october-6th"><i>The Solitaire Conspiracy</i></a>, the latter two of which are shorter projects released as "Bithell Shorts".</p>
<p><em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>isn't a Bithell Short, though; it's a full-length game, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-bds-pulls-out-rocket-league/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Team BDS has announced it is pulling out of the Rocket League Championship Series, the topmost tournament in the game’s esports ecosystem. The organisation stressed that it’s not removing itself from the Rocket League competitive scene entirely, but it’s making an adjustment that will take ‘into account the economic realities of Rocket League’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-champs-to-this">From Champs to This</h2>



<p>Team BDS was one of the most impactful organisations in the RLCS. In 2022 and 2024 (just weeks ago), the team won the RLCS World Championship, and in 2023, the squad wound up in second place. Elsewhere, Team BDS has claimed the top spot in many regional events and majors, netting a whopping $2.6 million in earnings and becoming one of the winningest organisations in Rocket League.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team made a shocking revelation, confirming that it’s withdrawing from the tournament it <strong>just won</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, Team BDS is reviewing its position and investment in the competitive Rocket League scene. After thorough analysis and careful consideration, we have decided to adjust our resources and priorities for this game, taking into account the economic realistic of Rocket League and the resources allocated by the publisher to the esports scene.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, the organisation’s players have been dismissed. However, it’s not the end of the line for Team BDS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We remain committed to Rocket League, which is part of the DNA of Team BDS, by staying in the competitive scene on one hand, and by launching our own tournament during this offseason on the other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team BDS will host a tournament called ‘Take the Throne’ in Geneva, Switzerland on November 23. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not goodbye from Team BDS, but it is a monumental change. It has been a solid four years for Team BDS in the RLCS, but this latest news confirms rumours that started circulating a couple of weeks ago.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-online-weekly-update-time-9302">GTA Online</a>'s time-limited zombie mode is here and players cannot get enough of it.</p>
<p>On 10th October, Rockstar launched a new survival mode and a community challenge that took us back to North Yankton to collectively slay 80 million zombies in order to unlock "special gifts", including a spooky-season appropriate Orange Glow Skeleton Onesie and the Red Hooded Skull Mask.</p>
<p>Within a couple of days, <a href="https://stats.gtao.gg/?contentId=Ev15vTKgxU6-Eg6atOSQlg">over 400,000 players</a> logged in to take part, prompting Rockstar to revise the collective slay count up from 80 million undead denizens to 800 million.</p>

<p>If successful, all participants will secure a Purple Glow and Green Glow skeleton onesie to match the goodies unlocked when the community previously hit 80 million collective zombie deaths.</p>
<p>Last night, Rockstar popped up again to confirm players were already over half-way towards the new goal, having "dispatched" 430 million zombies.</p> <div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y.1009038/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the early 1950s, the Indian government set out to design and plan a new capital city for the Punjab region, and they recruited the famed Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier to do the job. That city, and the name of the game we're going to review today, is&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>. In&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>, players take on the role of urban planners assisting Le Corbusier in this colorful, think-y game. I got a chance to check out and playtest a review copy of the game, so read on for my Chandigarh Board Game review to learn more.</p>
<h2>How Do You Play the&nbsp;Chandigarh board game?</h2>
<p><em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>is a pattern-building, point-to-point movement game for two to four players. The game's designed by Toni López and illustrated (gorgeously) by Edu Valls, published by the <a href="https://ludonova.com/en/our-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spanish gaming company&nbsp;Ludonova</a>&nbsp;and distributed in the USA by Asmodee North America.</p>
<p>In the game, players will collect cards, building materials, and the help of specialists as they move around the city of Chandigarh collecting prestige points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-early-board.jpeg?itok=9vZ-cSBd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-early-board.jpeg?itok=qSyec6JM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The buildings come in four different colors and the game ends when any one color of a building runs out. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige points wins.</p>
<p>And while this may sound simple, the core mechanics of the game create a much more in-depth, and at times potentially brain-burny experience that my gaming group and I were surprised to find.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-cards.jpeg?itok=jG0dYrmX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-cards.jpeg?itok=rxi0_Uf4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These cards are central to all aspects of the game, from movement to buildings and beyond.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's take a quick look at the core mechanics of&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh.&nbsp;</em>Normally I don't love getting into the nitty-gritty of how to play a game when reviewing it, but I truly believe understanding the basics of how to play the game here are central to understanding if this game is going to be a hit with your group, or come crashing down.</p>
<h3>Move and Build in&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em></h3>
<p>On your turn, you can do one of two different available actions, the first of which is the Move and Build action. Take a look at the image above, these are the cards you'll be drawing and collecting in the game. And these cards, which you'll hold in a tableau of up to three in front of you (called your project), tell you everything your pawn on the board can do.</p>
<p>First off, the footprint symbols at the top of cards represent how many spaces on the board your character can move, and&nbsp;you gain colored buildings whenever you play a card in front of you (those buildings are on the bottom of the card). Those buildings are your key resource in the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-crowded-streets.jpeg?itok=d0MDhIRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-crowded-streets.jpeg?itok=n_PE5iUk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So based on the cards in front of you, you'll move from intersection to intersection on the board, laying down buildings in your collection. But why? Well that's where the second action comes in...</p>
<h3>Add a New Card to Your Project and Score in <em>Chandigarh</em></h3>
<p>This second action,&nbsp;Add a New Card to your Project and Score, controls one of the main ways you gain victory points, influences how far you can move on the board, and controls the buildings you gain. When you add a new card to your project you'll add it to one of the outer edges of your cards. You can only ever have three cards in front of you, so if you do already have three cards, the incoming card will "push" the card on the opposite side of your project off, and you'll score that pushed off card.</p>
<p>Each card contains scoring conditions - like having two blue buildings in adjacent city blocks - and you'll score for each time that condition is met on the board. Pushing cards together also gives you buildings to add to your reserve.</p>
<h2>How does it feel to play the&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>board game?</h2>
<p>Here's what's so interesting about&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;- those descriptions of the core game above will either leave players scratching their heads, or salivating at the prospect of forethought and planning required to make moves in the game. There are other elements that add complication, like the benefit of being the last person to place a building on a city block.</p>
<p>There are also four randomly selected specialists in each game, which give you little game-breaking abilities if you build the right building on a block they're occupying. So here's how it feels the play the game: you move from intersection to intersection, carefully laying down buildings to try to hit one of your cards' scoring conditions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-full-board-setup.jpeg?itok=nB6Hv5vW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-full-board-setup.jpeg?itok=_QwtoKax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But then you need more buildings, so you'll have to bump one of your scoring cards off your project. Maybe you weren't quite ready to score that yet, but you&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;need a yellow building - so that card's got to go. These pressure-points, and complex (but not complicated) moments make&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>a unique experience that may overwhelm some gamers.</p>
<h2>The Look and Feel of <em>Chandigarh</em></h2>
<p>By far the best part of&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;is the artwork, design, and colorful elements of the game.&nbsp;Edu Valls, illustrator of the lovingly crunchy&nbsp;<em>Bitoku</em>, uses charming hand-drawn illustrations throughout the game to give this a warm, inviting, and sophisticated look that perfectly blends a midcentury look with colors and tones you'd expect for a game about Chandigarh. Le Corbusier would be proud.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-illustration-image.jpg?itok=T_SdFuIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-illustration-image.jpg?itok=TQX8bhYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The components are also all solid, with wooden tokens representing buildings. Each of the four different color types of buildings also reflect real-life buildings in Chandigarh, which is a very nice touch!</p>
<h2><em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>Board Game - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As I've mentioned above, this is a game that is more chunky than you might expect for the mechanics and illustrations, but it does fit in well with like other pattern-centric games with cute themes, like <em>Calico&nbsp;</em>or <em>Tiny Towns</em>. And while <em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;won't be for every gamer, there's so much here to recommend it.</p>
<p>The decision tree logic you have to make&nbsp;<em>on every turn</em>&nbsp;may burn out some, but it's core to what makes&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;so much fun to get into. If you're looking for a game that blends limited movement, limited resources, and careful planning, while still clocking in at around 45 minutes, you can do no better than&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>.</p>

<p>When you do manage to take down a Gigantamax Pokemon and catch it for yourself, you'll be able to use Candy and Max Particles to level up your 'mon and unlock new moves, just like with Dynamax Pokemon.</p>
<p>Each Gigantamax Pokemon is capable of learning "up to three Max Moves: a unique attack, Max Spirit, and Max Guard".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, Gigantamax Pokemon have a unique G-Max move they can use at the start of battle, and it "may not be the same type as [the Pokemon's] Fast Attack", according to Niantic. Better strategize accordingly.</p>

<p>This new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>announcement comes against the backdrop of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-freak-pokemon-hack-confirmed">a massive leak</a> that appeared over the weekend, with tons of sprites, screenshots, and other information about past and future&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games now widely available across the internet.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>is available to download right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24267841/luis-von-ahn-duolingo-owl-language-learning-gamification-generative-ai-android-decoder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Today, I’m talking with Luis von Ahn, the cofounder and CEO of Duolingo, the popular app that teaches languages. It’s an interesting time to be in the language business: if there’s anything the current state of AI tech <em>can </em>do, it’s babble away in different languages with people who aren’t quite fluent in what they’re hearing. </p><p>That means there are lots of opportunities to enhance a product like Duolingo with AI, and Luis and I talked about the new features in something called Duolingo Max, which offers chat conversations with some characters and even video calls with an AI avatar named Lily.</p><p>I wanted to talk about all of that, but I also wanted to talk to Luis about learning generally. If you’re like me, you’ve stopped and started using Duolingo several times; if you’re an overachiever, you’ve got a streak going and might even have a streak to maintain today. That streak is the key, and you’ll hear Luis come back to that as a big idea several times.</p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems.&nbsp;Subscribe&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>Engagement is the key, he says, because simply <em>showing up</em> is the cornerstone of actually making progress with language learning. You can’t teach someone who isn’t there, so over time, Duolingo has become more and more of a game, because people like to play games.</p><p>But there are real conflicts between gamification and actual learning. Luis is happy to admit that that conflict exists, and he’s given it a lot of thought. For him, the gamification is the important part because not only does it bring you back to Duolingo, keeping the business humming along nicely, but he says it also produces the results in language proficiency that Duolingo is aiming for.&nbsp;</p><p>Luis got pretty deep into explaining where the money comes from. As you might guess, it’s from iPhone users in wealthier countries like the United States. And some technical decisions Duolingo made very early on mean the iOS version takes priority — it can take a year or more for features to roll out on the Android version of the app.</p><p>But Duolingo is a global product, where the biggest chunk of learners are actually trying to learn English — and those users are <em>way</em> more likely to use an Android phone and to want or need a free version of the product. There are a lot of tensions here, and you’ll hear Luis talk about his own childhood in a poorer country and how that informs his decisions.</p><p>This is a good one — Luis is the founder, and he’s helped the company to go public and now is helping it to embrace a pretty big technology shift. AI has a direct impact on the product he makes, and we talked about it all in a pretty direct way, with only a handful of jokes about founder mode. And of course, I asked him whether he approves of all the unhinged things the Duolingo owl says on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn. Here we go.</p><p><em>This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Luis von Ahn, you are the CEO and cofounder of Duolingo. Welcome to <em>Decoder</em>.</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p><strong>I often start by asking CEOs what their company is, but I feel like everybody knows what Duolingo is. How do <em>you</em> define Duolingo?</strong></p><p>It’s an app that teaches languages. That’s what we’re mostly known for. As of the last couple of years, we have also taught math and music. It’s the most popular way to learn languages in the world. A fun fact: there are more people learning languages on Duolingo in the US than in all US high schools combined. This is true in most countries in the world. We teach languages to more people than the public school systems.</p><div><p><strong>You have some </strong><a href="https://investors.duolingo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/duolingo-introduces-ai-powered-innovations-duocon-2024"><strong>big announcements</strong></a><strong> coming up at Duocon that will be public by the time this episode airs. One of them is the ability to </strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPIxxfBwjkTA"><strong>chat with characters like Lily</strong></a><strong> and others.</strong></p></div><p>Yes, the ability to video call with <a href="https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Lily">Lily</a>.</p><p><strong>How does that work? How are you making that happen?</strong></p><p>We have this <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/building-character/">cast of characters</a> that our users love. One of them is an emo teen with purple hair who is very unimpressed by you. You can talk to her now and practice your conversation skills, and you can have really good conversations with her. There are a lot of things that are amazing about her. First of all, she adapts to your level — we know your level because you’ve been learning on Duolingo, so we have a pretty good idea of what your level is.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing is that she has memory, so she remembers the last time you talked about something. For example, I just had a conversation today where she remembered that, last time, we talked about the fact that I like Nirvana. She was telling me that her favorite song is “Smells Like Teen Spirit.”</p><p><strong>Easy choice, I have to say.</strong></p><p>We’re dating ourselves on that one, but yes. These are pretty enjoyable conversations, and you get to practice your language. It’s entirely spoken, and it just works really well. We’re very happy because this is the first time that you think, “We really are not going to need humans for this.”</p><p><strong>The animations and stuff, are those stock animations? Are they loops? How does that work? Is it in real time?</strong></p><p>Yes. It’s animated in real time. We have a rig for her. We bought two animation studios in Detroit. This is why we have an office in Detroit. They’ve done a really good job. Her mouth moves when she’s speaking, and it’s tied to what she’s saying. She rolls her eyes at you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When you think about that investment — “We’re going to start building rigs and animations for characters. We’re going to do it all in real time” — I’m just coming back to cost. That’s a big investment. Do you think that’s going to make your existing users pay more money? Or is it going to get you new users?</strong></p><p>I think it’s both. We see it as continuing to work on the app. There are a lot of places where we use a lot of animation, and we see it as continuing to work on the app. And generally, as we continue working on the app, we get more users and get more of them to pay.</p><p><strong>The reason I ask that in this context specifically is that the economics of AI is just a series of question marks right now. I ask this of everybody who’s making the investments. How do you see it coming out on the other end?</strong></p><p>For this particular feature, I think it’s an excellent use of large language models, and on our end, it’s working pretty well.</p><p><strong>The other big announcement you have is called Adventures. It sounds like a video game. What’s going on there?</strong></p><p>The way Duolingo works is that the homescreen is basically a path, and you’re just doing lessons. Some of the lessons are now going to be this thing we call an “adventure,” which is really just one of those video games where you move characters around. What’s cool about it is that you’re learning how to solve real-world situations on Duolingo.</p><p>For example, it’s like a little video game where you are one of the characters and you’re told, “Okay, go buy a pizza.” You move and have to ask around, and then you ask some people, and they tell you, “Oh, the pizza place is over there.” It’s super fun and it helps you learn to navigate the real world. So we’ve been working on that. What’s cool about that feature is that all the scenarios were mostly generated by AI. In the past, that feature would’ve taken a long time to scale, but we were able to scale it pretty quickly because of AI.</p><p><strong>I played with Duolingo this morning. I have a long and complicated history with trying to learn Hindi. It’s free. I was using it for free today. How does the app make money?</strong></p><p>It is free. You can use it entirely for free without ever having to pay. If you don’t pay, you may have to see some ads, and we make money from the ads. But also, if you want to turn off the ads, you can pay to subscribe, and it turns off the ads and gives you some extra features. We also make money from the subscription, and actually, the majority of the revenue comes from the subscription.</p><p><strong>Is Duolingo profitable as a company?</strong></p><p><strong>I’m curious about this. I hear about this split from almost everyone we talk to: we start out, we want to grow our base of users, ads help us do that. It helps us keep the product free. And then the real money is going to come when we add value and we add paid subscriptions. Particularly with advertising lately with app tracking transparency on Apple platforms, with the massive influx of inventory from all the other platforms in the world, it seems like ads are even harder to make money on than ever. Has that been the case for you?</strong></p><p>It’s probably true. Ads have never been a priority for us. I don’t know the exact number, but it’s something like 6 or 7 percent of our revenue comes from ads. For us, as long as they’re there, they’re a good reason for people to subscribe. But generally, we make about 80 percent of our revenue from subscriptions, even though, by the way, only a little under 10 percent of our monthly active users pay to subscribe. So 10 percent of our monthly active users give us more than 80 percent of our revenue.</p><p><strong>And all of that revenue is in languages? Or is math growing?</strong></p><p>The majority is languages. Math and music are growing. We launched those about a year ago, so they’re just getting started. It’s overwhelmingly languages.</p><p><strong>What languages are the most popular?</strong></p><p>English is the most popular by far. Forty-five percent of our active users are learning English. The second is Spanish, the third is French, and then there’s a big drop-off after that.</p><p><strong>Are the majority of your users outside of the United States? Or are they inside the US?</strong></p><p>US is about 20 percent of our users, and 80 percent are international.</p><p><strong>So are 80 percent of your users trying to learn English?</strong></p><p>About 45 percent are trying to learn English. Within the international segment, they also want to learn other languages.</p><p><strong>There are a lot of languages offered in the app, and it seems like one way you could allocate resources would be by saying, “English is the most popular, we’re going to put the most resources there.” But that doesn’t feel like how the app works. How do you think about it?</strong></p><p>We definitely do some of that. I was going to say we don’t do it as much as we should, but I don’t know if that’s the case. We don’t do it commensurately with the number of users because we would probably spend all of our resources on English, Spanish, and French. We spend the majority of our resources in the top eight languages to learn, and then we spend very little resources outside of that. The top eight are English, Spanish, and French. Then there is German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, I think, and Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mandarin or Cantonese?</strong></p><p>Mandarin. And after that, there really is a huge drop-off. For example, Arabic is a large language, but there are not that many people learning Arabic. So we do put some resources there, but it’s much less than for the larger languages.</p><p><strong>How do you think about that kind of demand? I open Duolingo, I look at it, I’m like, “I should probably learn some Cantonese.”&nbsp; I think, “Man, I should be much better at Hindi than I am.” Those are real things that I think all the time. I imagine there are a lot of people in my particular diaspora who feel the same way. But that’s latent demand. Do you ever go out and say to people, “You should learn some Spanish”?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We don’t.</p><p><strong>Do you ever say, “We should market Spanish in the American South”?</strong></p><p>We don’t. We have remained neutral about that, but it is an interesting thing that demand for learning languages is not as correlated as you would like to see with the number of speakers or maybe even usefulness in a geopolitical world. For example, even though Chinese is one of our top eight languages to learn, only about 2 percent of our users are learning it. It’s relatively small, even as the most spoken language in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that goes into people’s calculus is how hard a language is to learn. Chinese, at least for English speakers, is just a lot harder. <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">We have data</a>. To get to a pretty good point in Spanish for English speakers takes, call it, 300 to 400 hours. That same level of knowledge for Chinese takes about 2,000 hours. The reality is, in the United States, if you’re just going for pragmatism, return on investment, Spanish is probably much better. In the US, you probably should learn Spanish. It’s quite an easy language to learn.</p><p><strong>In the US, you should probably learn Spanish. That is a marketing message.</strong></p><p>Well, we don’t say that. We’ve tried to remain neutral. We probably would get in trouble, or I would get in trouble inside the company, if we started pushing people on certain languages.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maybe not inside the app, but as a way to grow, as a way to capture new users. It seems like a lot of what Duolingo is right now is people know they should be multilingual or bilingual at least, and so Duolingo is there. But there’s also a huge portion of the population, at least in this country, who are like, “Screw it. I speak English.” The idea that there’s value in learning a second language is foreign to them.</strong></p><p>There is, although I’m very happy with our results in the US. Historically, there hasn’t been a big desire to learn languages in the US and the UK. The thinking has been, “You can learn English. We are very happy.” In the US, 80 percent of our users were not learning a language before Duolingo. We’re growing the market in the US. It’s the same number in the UK. I’m very happy with that.</p><p><strong>I think back to learning French when I was in high school in Wisconsin. There’s learning the language and then there’s all of the culture that comes with a language, particularly some of the regional languages. High school French is a lot of looking at a picture of a baguette. It’s totally foreign to whatever you’re doing. Do you think about that, inside of Duolingo, that there’s a huge cultural component here?</strong></p><p>We do.</p><p><strong>That’s more investment, right?</strong></p><p>We do, and we try to add the culture. We don’t do it as much as maybe we should. We try to stick mostly with languages. It also depends on the language. Some languages are quite tight to the culture, and some are less so. Spanish is a good example. There are 20-some countries that speak Spanish, and some of them are pretty different than others. We do a little bit of culture, but we try not to be like, “Oh, you’re learning Spanish. You’re a Mexican person with a sombrero.” We try not to do that. I mean, we also have to not be offensive. But we try to add it a little bit. I would say that it’s not the primary goal.</p><p><strong>The reason I ask that is that Duolingo is instantiated for most people as its mascot. We should talk about </strong><a href="https://design.duolingo.com/writing/duo#duos-voice-and-tone"><strong>the mascot’s personality</strong></a><strong> and its </strong><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7415619477552827679?lang=en"><strong>social media presence</strong></a><strong>, but it’s fairly abstracted from a person teaching you the language. There’s not someone on the other side that’s like, “I’m teaching you this. Here’s the culture that comes with it.” You might have other teachers who might teach you in another way.</strong></p><p><strong>There’s an abstraction there that just feels interesting, especially as we’re obviously going to talk about AI and how you’re using that and how you’re expanding the platform. I want to push on that a little bit, that abstraction. Do you think it’s resulting in people who’ve learned a language or people who’ve learned how to communicate?</strong></p><p>It’s been very much on purpose for us to not put humans in the app, as in human teachers. There’s nothing wrong with human teachers. It’s just the case that, from the beginning, we’ve been a technology company, and we’ve wanted to make it so that technology teaches you. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is that it’s a lot cheaper to teach you with technology than with a human teacher.</p><p>The other thing is, somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of language learners don’t want to talk to another human. They may tell you they do, but they don’t. It’s because when you’re learning a language, you’re pretty shy about it, and only the extreme extroverts are okay talking to a stranger on video in a language that they’re not very good at. The majority of people won’t do it.</p><p>We’ve done research studies over the years because, over time, we thought maybe we should add humans. But these research studies are some of the most amazing things that I’ve seen. When you talk to a user, you ask them, “What do you think could make Duolingo better?” Historically, in the past, they have said, “Well, more practice conversation with a real person.” They have said that. And then you ask the user, “Okay, so you’re telling me if I put a human on Duolingo, you would do that?” And then they say, “Yes, I would.” And you can even ask them, “Would you pay for it?” And then they’ll say, “Yes, I’ll pay for it.” And then you tell them, “Okay, do you want to do it right now?” And the answer invariably is, “No, no, not right now.” People just don’t want to do that.</p><p>That’s why we haven’t put humans in, and I think it’s been a good decision, especially now that we can do a pretty good job of getting you to practice conversation without a human with large language models.</p><p><strong>I want to ask about this because I’ve been asking a lot of people on this show: what good are these large language models? What are the products you’re going to make? I understand you’re making the models, and it feels like Duolingo has a very natural solution, which is that you can talk to it and it’ll talk back. It doesn’t matter if everyone is hallucinating because all you’re doing is practicing talking.</strong></p><p>That’s exactly right. It is a really good application. You said it. It doesn’t matter if it says something that is a little wrong because you’re just practicing your language. Also, it doesn’t matter if it makes a small mistake. Sometimes it makes a small grammatical mistake. People don’t even notice because they’re usually beginners in Spanish or French. It also can adapt to your level really well. Large language models are really good at adapting to your level.</p><p>So we tell it, “Okay, adapt to a beginner in Spanish.” We even tell it, “Hey, because we’ve seen this person learn on Duolingo, we actually know all the words they know.” So we tell the language model, “This person only knows these 200 words, so please mostly use only these 200 words.” It works really well for that.</p><p><strong>How much investment into AI are you making? This is a new product. It’s very costly. Everyone is telling me about how much the Nvidia GPUs cost. You said you’ve only just become profitable. This feels like the thing that will immediately make you not profitable again as you invest in AI.</strong></p><p>We’re investing a lot. Fortunately, it’s good for us in terms of profitability for two reasons. There are two places where we invest in AI. The first is generating data that is going to be used in our lessons. That data <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/10/duolingo-ai-layoffs/">used to be generated partly with humans</a>, and now it’s mostly generated with AI, and it’s a lot cheaper to generate with AI than with humans. It’s also a lot faster to generate it with AI, so we’re very happy with that.</p><p>And then the other big use is real-time conversation. That one is expensive. It’s expensive to provide a real-time conversation with a user, but what we had to do is add a higher-priced plan. We now have two subscription plans. We have Super Duolingo, which is our standard subscription, and we added a new one called Duolingo Max, which is about twice the price of Super Duolingo and gives you the conversation practice. It’s expensive, but people pay twice as much, so it really doesn’t cut into it. It’s worked out well for us.</p><p><strong>Let me dive into the economics of that because, in general, I’m fascinated by whether any of this will result in profitable, sustainable companies. There’s a lot of money flowing into this. So, you charged twice the price to run inference. Is that someone else’s large language model?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes, we use OpenAI.</p><p><strong>So you’re buying some capacity from OpenAI, you’re buying some tokens from them, and you’re reselling them to users for twice the price of your standard plan. What’s your margin on that resale?</strong></p><p>I don’t know the percentages off the top of my head, but I do know that it’s good for us in terms of margins.</p><p><strong>That’s the thing I’m curious about. I don’t know if it’s good for OpenAI all the way at the bottom of that chain. I don’t know if that’s profitable for them. But as you build products on this stuff, it seems like your economics depend on their economics, in some way, because you need to add a margin to that. That all seems very complicated and tenuous, especially if the AI features are what bring you new users.</strong></p><p>The good news is, at the moment, the AI features are not bringing us new users.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Or new revenue?</strong></p><p>Yes, it is bringing us new revenue. There’s a good margin there. So, for a number of reasons, the price of the same exact call is going down over time, whether you do it through an OpenAI or whether you do it through a Microsoft. Everything is getting more efficient, and chips are also getting cheaper over time. At the moment, there’s a good amount of cushion, but we expect that there’ll be an even larger amount of cushion over time. At least for our application, I’m not particularly concerned in terms of margins. For our application, the margins work out pretty well.</p><p><strong>Do you think the models are somewhat interchangeable? This is a thing that I’ve been hearing more and more is that the model business isn’t the thing; the product business is the thing.</strong></p><p>I think the answer is yes, but the operative term is “somewhat.” They are “somewhat” interchangeable. We’ve tried to build our technology stacks so that you can interchange them, but the reality is that you start getting wonky stuff because you probably spent a lot of time testing your way into the right queries. You may have done some fine-tuning. You can interchange them, but if you do, you probably need to spend a few months making sure that the wonkiness goes away.</p><p><strong>When you think about this investment over time, does it feel like you need to put the money in upfront and you’ll get more efficient on the back end? Or does it feel like, “Oh, this is going to be the future of the company, so we need to rebuild around the capabilities of a large language model”?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s somewhere in between. I do think that large language models are going to be very positive for Duolingo — they already are, and I think they’re going to continue being very positive. What is not true is that large language models solve all our problems. One of the biggest issues that people aren’t talking about, particularly with education, is that large language models are good at teaching you stuff. They’re not good at engagement. And that’s the hardest thing with education.</p><p>The hardest thing about me trying to teach you something is just keeping you engaged. Somehow, people forget. I see some people saying, “You can learn quantum physics with ChatGPT.” And yeah, sure, but that’s just not that impressive. You can learn quantum physics with a book. The technology to learn that has been around for a long time. It’s called a book and it works. It’s just that people don’t really want to read a quantum physics book. And similarly, most people probably don’t want to go to ChatGPT and start asking questions about quantum physics. It’s the same thing for language learning. Large language models are very good at getting you to practice, but keeping you engaged is pretty hard.</p><p>I don’t know if large language models are going to help all that much with that part. In the end, this is a sad thing, but the reality is that Duolingo is very gamified. I wholeheartedly believe most people would rather spend more time playing <em>Candy Crush</em> than talking to others. That’s maybe a sad truth. And there are some exceptions. I mean, people love talking to someone they’re in love with, and sure, that’s nice, but the reality is, most of the time, most people would rather spend time playing <em>Candy Crush</em> or scrolling on Instagram than talking to others. I just don’t think large language models are going to help much with all of that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have a long history in gamification. Your first project, which </strong><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1331965/google-acquires-recaptcha-in-two-for-one-deal.html"><strong>you sold to Google</strong></a><strong>, was a gamified thing. You did reCAPTCHA, which is essentially gamifying training data in a particular way.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you think there’s an evolution in Duolingo — that the first thing that you worked on was the engagement and bringing users back to the app and having the character, and then the underlying content was language lessons? When I first started using Duolingo several years ago, I was like, “Oh, this is very familiar. It’s just that this bird won’t leave me alone and that’s why I’m back again.” And now you’re talking about this whole other spectrum of things: we’re going to use AI; we’re going to have these natural language conversations; we’re going to expand to mathematics.</strong></p><p><strong>When did you feel like you were making the transition from “we’re gamifying this very familiar thing” and “we’re using this new engagement mechanism” to “this is now a wholly new thing”?</strong></p><p>From the beginning, this is a central thesis that we believe here at Duolingo: the hardest thing about learning something by yourself is staying motivated. In fact, that is probably the reason for the vast majority of our success is that we realized that early on. From the beginning, we have tried to have a thing that is enjoyable to use and that keeps you coming back. We have probably spent more effort on that than anything else.</p><p>Internally, our feeling is that learning a language is a lot like working out. It doesn’t matter all that much whether you’re doing the elliptical or a Peloton or a treadmill. By far, what matters the most is that you’re doing it every day, whatever the hell you’re doing. It’s kind of the same with Duolingo. Maybe some methods are more efficient than others, but what matters is that you’re doing it every day. We got very good at that. Now, once we got very good at that, we started trying to add more sophistication in what we teach, and we’ve been doing that for the last few years. But always, primarily, we are a motivation engine.</p><p><strong>Is that the core of it still?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s still the core.</p><p><strong>I’m going to end up asking you about </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/03/business/dealbook/founder-mode-chesky-graham.html"><strong>founder mode</strong></a><strong>, but you’re the founder. How do you keep the focus on that part instead of everything else?</strong></p><p>I do. I spend effort on that. But it’s not just me. At the company, it is pretty well understood that if it’s not fun, it’s not going to work. We spend a lot of effort trying to keep Duolingo enjoyable. This is why, for example, when we did this thing where you can talk to an AI to practice conversation, you’re not just talking to a random AI; you’re talking to one of our cast of characters. It has a personality. Really, everything we do, every time we put something out, it’s ingrained in our thinking that, “Oh, this has to be enjoyable.” I spend effort pushing that agenda, but I don’t have to all that much because it’s very ingrained in the company.</p><p><strong>How big is Duolingo now?</strong></p><p>About 850 people.</p><p><strong>Where are you all located?</strong></p><p>The largest office is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We have about 400 people there. We have about 250 in New York, and then we have offices in a few cities. We have one in Detroit, we have one in Seattle, one in Berlin, and one in Beijing. All of those offices have 30 people in them. But one key thing is we are not remote. We’ve got to come to one of those offices.</p><p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p><p>I just wholeheartedly believe that you can work better that way. Most of what we do, not 100 percent, but most of what we do, is creative stuff. It’s a lot harder to do so over Slack and Zoom. That worked out for about nine months during the pandemic, but it is actually impressive how when the pandemic started and we all had to go remote, we executed pretty well. But toward the end of it, our ideas had run out. We were executing the ideas, but we had run out of new ideas. It’s pretty amazing, as soon as we came back to the office, within three months, you would see all these ideas popping up, and it’s because, when you’re remote, you can’t sit in front of a whiteboard and talk about stuff. Also, we have lunch together here every day. In the lunch line, you hear people being like, “Hey, I haven’t seen you in a while. I thought of saying this to you.” It’s just something you would never send a Slack message for.</p><p>I think the combination of all of that makes it a better company. I don’t have much proof, but I am extremely convinced.</p><p><strong>Sundar Pichai at Google told me at the very beginning of the pandemic that he was worried that the company would run out of ideas if they stayed remote too long. He said, “We know what we need to do for the next turn. I’m worried about what happens at the next turn.” Did you have controversy when you reimplemented return to office?</strong></p><p>No, fortunately not.</p><p><strong>Do your employees think that?</strong></p><p>No, no, no.</p><p><strong>Do they agree with you?</strong></p><p>We’ve done a lot of dumb things at Duolingo, but this was not one of the dumb things we have done, in retrospect. In my first message saying, “Everybody’s going to work remote,” I said, “But we’re going to come back to the office. I do not want Duolingo to turn into a remote company. We are not a remote company.” We kept saying that the whole time. A lot of companies did this thing where during the pandemic, they would hire people all over the world because, whatever, you’re remote. We never did that. When we hired people, we would say, “I get that you’re not coming to the office right now, but your job is in New York, and we expect you to be in New York because at some point hopefully soon, we will be back in the office.” We never stopped repeating that. By the time we said, “Okay, time to go back to the office,” this was not a surprise for anybody. I don’t think we lost a single employee from that.</p><p><strong>Do you think that the markets you’re in help you with that — being in Pittsburgh and Detroit? If you were in San Francisco, I think a lot of people would say, “Screw you, I can go get another job.”</strong></p><p>That’s probably true. We are not in San Francisco, and that’s probably true. Although the New York office is now the second largest office, and we also didn’t lose people in New York.</p><p><strong>Do you find that people are demanding more flexibility even with a full return to office?</strong></p><p>Sure. I mean, compared to before. For example, we’re not here five days a week in the office. The way we work is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, you have to be in the office. Monday and Friday, it’s optional. What happens, in practice, is that about half the people come in on Mondays, and around 20 percent of the people come in on Fridays.</p><p><strong>We are talking on a Friday.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I am here. I am here in the office, though.</p><p><strong>Oh, you’re there. Oh, very good.</strong></p><p>I am here in the office. I come. But I don’t feel like I have the political power inside this company to say, “All right, people, you’ve got to come in five days a week.” I feel like that would not go over well.</p><p><strong>One of the other pieces of the pandemic puzzle and return to office is that there was a suppression of demand to travel and explore. I have friends who, at least from their Instagrams, haven’t set foot back in the United States in two or three years. Have you connected to that group of people who want to learn languages on the go? Has the reexplosion of travel had an impact on your business?</strong></p><p>Travel is interesting. Now that we’re a publicly traded company, people have hypothesized all kinds of stuff about travel with us.</p><p>They’re like, “Travel’s opening up. That may be good for Duolingo.” Or they say, “Travel’s drying up. That may be bad for Duolingo.” The reality is that travel does not affect us all that much. I can have hypotheses for why that is, but we have not seen traveling closing down or opening up affect us all that much.</p><p>We have a lot of learners that have different motivations, but the two big buckets are not travel. One of them is a hobby, and that’s the biggest bucket in the US. If you ask people in the US why they’re using Duolingo, the most common answer is, “Well, I used to play a lot of <em>Candy Crush </em>or I used to do a lot of Instagram and now I’m doing Duolingo and at least I’m learning some Spanish. It’s just a hobby.”</p><p>And then the other huge group is people learning English. For them, it’s not about travel. They just need to learn English either for educational opportunities or for job opportunities. Those two big buckets account for 90–95 percent of our users. Travel just doesn’t affect it very much.</p><p><strong>We started talking about latent demand. What are people coming to you for? And then there’s growth, which is, “how do we go create some demand?” When you think about the structure of the company, would you ever say, “We’ve got to go do marketing to make travel happen”? Or is that just not how you think about it?</strong></p><p>No. In our marketing, we haven’t thought about that. Ninety percent of our users come in from word of mouth, and that will keep happening, I think. We also spend very little in marketing comparatively. Our entire marketing budget for the whole world, and we really do operate in every single country in the world, is 50 million a year, which is quite small for a company with our revenue. But whatever we’re doing with marketing seems to be working pretty well, and we don’t spend a lot of money on it.</p><p><strong>I feel like I have yet to ask you the <em>Decoder </em>question. So, as long as we’re talking about your marketing spend, how is the company structured?</strong></p><p>We have functions. There’s the marketing function, there’s the engineering function, there is the product management function, design, etc. We have functions and each function has a function head. To give you a relative idea of the sizes of the functions: engineering, product management, and design combined account for about 70 percent of our employees. Design is weirdly large for our company. We have 850 total employees but about 130 people in the design department. So design is large, but we have engineering, product, and design account for about 70 percent.</p><p>Those are the people working on the product. If you look at that group, it’s structured into areas, and each area is related to one of the things we’re trying to optimize. For example, with language learning, the three main things we’re trying to optimize are: engagement, so how fun Duolingo is; teaching [the material] better; and how much money we make. We have an area for each one of those things. Then, in each area, there are teams, and in each team, there are people. It’s a little bit of a matrix structure.</p><p>One important thing that I think has worked really well for us — but it’s not that easy to do —&nbsp;is that our areas and our teams are not feature-based. What I mean by that is that most software or app companies usually have a team for each feature. So this is the login team, which owns login. Or if you have a leaderboard, this is the leaderboard team and they own the leaderboard. We do not have that. Our teams don’t own features. Our teams own metrics. So we have a team for subscription revenue. We have a team for daily active users. And they can touch whatever they want in the app. All they have to do is continually increase the metrics. There are positives to this, which are very aligned to metrics. There are negatives in that no team owns certain features. When something breaks, there are a lot of people being like, “It’s not my feature. I don’t know.” There are positives and negatives, but all in all, this has actually worked out really well for us.</p><p><strong>This sounds, one, like a reaction to working at Google where teams do own things like the login screen and they endlessly communicate about how they’re going to change logins. But it also seems like it might work for a small company where one person can see the whole product or understand the whole product and how it all works together. And then you’re going to get inevitable collisions as two people try to change something to increase two different metrics in different directions. How do you resolve those collisions?</strong></p><p>There are definitely collisions. There are a couple of things that help us here. One is, every change to the app passes through this review process called product review, which is not just one person. There’s a group of people that have a lot of knowledge about how the whole thing works. They serve as a little bit of a semaphore, a little bit of like, “No, you should not do that.”</p><p>And then the other thing that is really important is we have guardrail metrics. So here’s how that works: If you are on the team that’s trying to improve subscription revenue, your goal is to improve that metric. But we tell you, “You can’t mess up any of the other metrics.” For example, if you do an experiment that improves subscription revenue by a million bucks or whatever but it decreases daily active users, you can’t launch it. That has really helped teams police themselves. They at least won’t go do anything that really messes something else up. The combination of these two things has helped.</p><p>You are right that if we had 100,000 employees, I don’t think the structure would work. That said, I don’t think that a company like Duolingo, at least with the products that we have, needs 100,000 employees. I think we’ll grow and we’ll continue growing. Maybe we’ll get to, I don’t know, 5,000 employees, but I doubt we’ll ever get to something like 100,000 employees.</p><p><strong>How often do these collisions come all the way up to you? How often do you have to make a tradeoff?</strong></p><p>Not that often. Teams police themselves a lot. I do see every single change that passes through the app. I do see that, but usually, I’m not making tradeoff calls. The main thing that I’m looking for is making sure that everything’s high quality.</p><p><strong>At the beginning of the show, you were joking about founder mode because I called you the cofounder. That’s Brian Chesky, who has </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716903/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-rooms-ai-travel-future-of-work-summer-2023"><strong>been on the show</strong></a><strong>. He’s talked a lot about how he refactored Airbnb. He was the conductor of the orchestra. That has gotten whatever amount of attention it’s gotten.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Do you see yourself in that kind of role, that you’re the person who can see the whole app, that you are the person who understands how all these tradeoffs are getting made?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s definitely true. The good news is our employees stick around for a very long time, and our leadership, particularly in the product areas, has been the same for the last eight years. I have a view of everything, but the reality is that our head of product, Cem [Kansu], has a view of everything, too. Our head of design, [Ryan] Sims, also has a view of pretty much everything. Yes, I am in that mode, but we have a number of people who could probably play that role as well.</p><p><strong>When the three of you disagree, how do you resolve it?</strong></p><p>The good news is there’s little disagreement, which happens for a few reasons. The first is that we’re a very metrics-based company, so usually, we just let the metrics speak. If we run an A/B test and the metrics say something, my opinion doesn’t matter all that much unless it’s something that we think is really like a dark pattern or something. But generally, my opinion or their opinion doesn’t matter all that much. That’s one reason. The other is that we’ve been working together for so long that we’re pretty aligned on everything. And then the last thing, I have the saying, “If we’re going to go by opinion, let’s go by mine” Generally, when we have disagreements, I see how deeply they believe in their thing, and sometimes I just disagree and commit. But if we believe with equal strength on something, I will just go with my thing.</p><p><strong>That might be the most succinct definition of founder mode I’ve heard yet, actually.</strong></p><p>What is — that “if we’re going to go with an opinion, let’s go with mine”?</p><p><strong>“Just do what I say” is really the answer to what founder mode is.</strong></p><p>But the majority of things, we don’t really go by opinion. The majority of things are just by data.</p><p><strong>So here’s the other <em>Decoder </em>question. This is a good foundation for it. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For the company or for me? They’re similar, but they’re not identical.</p><p><strong>Some people don’t think they’re different and some people think they are very different, so answer whichever way you want.</strong></p><p>For the company, the decisions are very much tied to return on investment. With most things, there’s a return on investment calculation. Even if we don’t sit there and write the numbers down, there’s how much effort you’re going to put into something and how much you’re going to get back. That drives most of our decision-making. There’s another thing that is not unique to Duolingo but I think is not the norm at most companies, which is, usually, when you’re doing a project, there are three things that matter: how much does it cost?; how fast are you going to do it?; and what’s the quality? Usually there are tradeoffs between these things. At Duolingo, the most important thing is quality, the second most important thing is speed, and the third most important thing is whether we’re on budget. In many companies, it’s the other way around, where the most important thing is budget, then speed, then quality. Here, quality is the most important thing. So that’s another component of our decision-making.</p><p>That’s for the company. For me, it’s very gut feeling-driven, which I used to find myself trying to justify. I have stopped doing that because, at this point, I’m like, “Look, this is what I think we should do. I can tell you reasons that I can probably come up with after the fact, but the reality is that my gut says we should do that.” Because I’ve been working on Duolingo for 13 years, my gut’s pretty good. It’s not 100 percent correct. I make mistakes, but it’s pretty good. I mainly do things based on gut feelings, and then I tell people the justification afterward. But everybody around me knows that these justifications are after the fact. They’re not rational thoughts.</p><p><strong>That obviously works for a startup founder for a private company. You’ve been </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/language-learning-app-duolingo-pops-35percent-in-public-debut-on-the-nasdaq.html"><strong>a public company</strong></a><strong> CEO for over three years. Is that working for you as a public company CEO?</strong></p><p>Yes, because again, the majority of decisions that we have to make, there’s a clear answer. It’s just like, “Well, look, this is going to lose us money. Let’s not do that.”</p><p><strong>But do you have to change the way you communicate? I’ve heard this from a handful of CEOs who’ve taken their companies public and now they’re on the quarterly reports cadence and they have investors. Elliott Investment Management might show up on your doorstep and be unhappy that you’re not marketing to more Chinese speakers or whatever. Have you had to change that attitude now that you run a public company?</strong></p><p>No, it’s been very fortunate. First of all, we hired an amazing CFO before we went public, Matt Skaruppa, and fortunately, he deals with most public company stuff. I don’t do a lot of that, and I’m very thankful for that because I don’t have a finance background. I have a PhD in computer science. That’s what I’m good at, not finance. So there’s that.</p><p>The other thing we’ve been fortunate about so far as a public company is that we’ve executed well. I think that has given us a little bit of latitude in that basically we don’t get asked very tough questions because we’ve executed very well. I am sure that won’t be the case forever. I’m sure at some point we’re going to miss a quarter. We haven’t so far, but I’m sure we will. And when that happens, I’ll probably have to answer some questions and I’ll probably have to tell people, “Sorry, we’ll be more buttoned up from now on.” But so far, I show up to earnings calls in a T-shirt. The day you see me show up to an earnings call in a suit, you’ll know that we fucked up.</p><p><strong>Yeah, it’s time to get out.</strong></p><p><em>[Laughs] </em>Like, “Oh, so sorry.”</p><p><strong>The other thing I hear from public company CEOs is something that relates to your emphasis on quality first. You have a lot of metrics, which means your investors can see a lot of your metrics or demand a lot of your metrics in different ways. Quality is not measurable in that way, right?</strong></p><p>It’s not.</p><p><strong>At least in the current market, it’s not a great story to investors if you’re saying, “Okay, we’re going to invest a bunch of money in AI, and we think in this use case, it’s going to be really successful for us or we can charge more for it but we have to spend a bunch of money upfront and we have to wait to make it good.” How are you managing that now?</strong></p><p>You’re right, quality is not measurable. The way we make decisions about that is that, particularly in our design department, we have people who are very much sticklers about quality. We’re like, “Nope, that’s just not good enough.” We do that a lot.</p><p>In terms of investment, I mean, honestly, with the public markets, we don’t talk much about that. We talk about the metrics. We don’t talk too much about how it turns out we spent an extra month working on this feature just because we didn’t really like the way the owl was animated. We don’t talk too much about that. I think that’s fine. But my guess is that if we went on earnings calls and spent all of our time talking about how much effort we put into animating our owl, I don’t think people would like that.</p><p><strong>I honestly think more companies should spend more time talking about how much time they spend making things good. That would be, I think, a significant upgrade to American capitalism.</strong></p><p>I would like that. But yeah, the reality is we do spend an inordinate amount of time on things. If you look at our app, it, over time, has become very animated. We spend an inordinate amount of time looking at the precise frames of the animation. We’re like, “See, this is not smooth enough.” I’m not claiming that our app is perfect, but we at least try really hard for it to get as close to perfect as possible.</p><p><strong>One thing that also seems hard to measure, or a metric that might lead you in different directions, is how successful Duolingo is. Maybe the most important metric of all is: Are people getting good at Spanish? Are they leaving this experience with the ability to communicate in Spanish? Do they not just know the language but can actually communicate? Can you measure that?</strong></p><p>Yes, we can, but not as effectively as you would like to measure it. So the answer is, yes, Duolingo works. We have measurements. I’ll tell you how we measure it. Unfortunately, this is the only way we know how to measure it reliably. It’s not that great of a way, but it’s this: You take somebody who’s just starting Duolingo, you ask them a bunch of questions about their previous knowledge, and you also give them a test to measure how much they know. Then you have them use Duolingo for a long time because it takes a while for you to actually learn stuff in the language. You have them use it for a year or two. And then, at the end of that period, you ask them questions about whether they used other resources and you also give them a test to figure out how much better they got. It turns out that people who knew nothing before and used Duolingo and did not use other resources learn about as much as or more than in a classroom. It varies by the study, but we’re pretty happy with that. The results actually work.</p><p>The problem with this way of measuring is that it’s very slow. It takes one or two years for us to get a new measurement, and I really don’t like that. But we have not been able to come up with a better way despite the fact that we have tried. We’ve done things in the app where we’re like, “Okay, we can do micro-measurements of whether you’ve learned this word.” It’s been super complicated to do that and never given great results. So we just rely on these old-school, “pre-test, post-test” methods. That’s it.</p><p><strong>This is where you veer right into lengthy society-level debates about education and how we measure the performance of schools and teachers. Do you feel like you’re participating in that system? You’re using their measurements, right? This is how schools do it. They test you.</strong></p><p>We are using their measurements, and efficacy is really important. We spend a lot of effort trying to make sure that we’re efficacious. The other good news, even though the timescale here is in years, is that you can plot how effective Duolingo is. If you look at it over the last 10 years, every year it is more effective than the previous year, for sure.</p><p><strong>That’s on this test-based measure. More people are passing the test?</strong></p><p>Yes, more people are getting higher scores on the test. Basically, people are learning more on Duolingo every year. And there are a number of reasons for that because we work to try to teach [the content] better. But it is definitely true.</p><p>At this point, when we compare ourselves, we know we are as good as or better than a classroom environment. We know we’re not yet as good as a good one-on-one human tutor. Our goal is that we can do that over the next three to five years: be as good as a one-on-one human tutor in terms of efficacy. But we’re way better in terms of getting you to stick around. But in terms of efficacy, if you have the money and the strength to continue going, a one-on-one human tutor does better.</p><p><strong>Do you think that there’s a conflict between gamification and engagement — the things that you’re historically successful at — and education?</strong></p><p>Yes, there is.</p><p><strong>How do you manage that conflict?</strong></p><p>Very easily. Always go with engagement.</p><p><strong>Really?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I mean, presumably, you’ve heard both sides of the argument. Why have you made this decision?</strong></p><p>I’ll give you many arguments, but the one that works the most is this: It doesn’t matter how effective you are. You can’t teach somebody who’s not there.</p><p><strong>And that’s it?</strong></p><p>That’s it. People leave. The reality is it’s not always true that engagement and learning outcomes are at odds. But when they are, we usually prefer going for engagement. I’ll give you an example. There are some things that are frustrating, and frustration makes you leave. We actually just smooth them. By that I mean, if I could force you to sit there, I may be able to teach the material to you in five minutes, but it’d be a very frustrating five minutes. Instead, what we do is teach it to you in two hours —&nbsp;just way slower, but the whole time, things are animating on the screen and you’re getting dopamine hits or whatever. Even though a really good teacher could have taught it to you in five minutes, watching you make mistakes, it would have been frustrating. We much prefer to keep you around.</p><p>Part of the reason is because we’re in an app setting as opposed to a school setting. In a school setting, the truth is the kids are held hostage there. They can’t leave. With an app setting, the tiniest frustration, people are like, “You know what? I’m going to go to TikTok now.” We just can’t lose those users. So we always opt for engagement, but that doesn’t mean we won’t teach the material to you. We’ll just take it a little slower.</p><p><strong>It’s clear that you have thought about this a lot.</strong></p><p>We’ve spent years thinking about this.</p><p><strong>I want to round this out a little bit because you have a very clear answer and a very clear point of view. What do you think the specific tension between gamification and education is? What are you losing when you always pick gamification?</strong></p><p>Probably the thing you’re losing is efficiency — by that I mean, the amount of content learned per unit time. The truth of the matter is, I grew up in the third world a while ago. Some of the stuff that I grew up being taught, my teachers were hitting me while teaching it. I’m not kidding. They would hit me. The reality is that I probably learned really fast because when you were learning penmanship, if you did the wrong thing, they hit you with a ruler. You have a real incentive to get that done very fast. You just learn really fast because you’re like, “Whoa.” So I think it’s true: you can learn faster if you’re in an environment where you’re forced to do so and nobody cares whether you feel good about it. But in our case, I’m okay with slightly slower learning as long as you’re still engaged.</p><p><strong>Efficiency, I understand that one. I had some pretty strict teachers in my time, but I was really good at taking the tests. My wife and I went to college together. She’s much smarter than me.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>But you’re a good test taker.</p><p><strong>She was always mad at me because I could just show up at the end and take the test. This is truly probably why she didn’t date me for years, because of that core frustration. This is what I mean by education. That human teacher can evaluate whether you’re good at taking a test or whether you’ve actually learned something. That’s the tradeoff that I was getting at, is that if it’s all a gamification engagement, people might just learn to play the game. They might not have learned anything.</strong></p><p>There’s probably a little bit of that. It’s very hard to measure, of course. But the reality is, ultimately, it works. Duolingo works. Just as an example, for me, I’ve been using only Duolingo to learn French for the past few years. At this point, I can watch Netflix shows in French — with no subtitles or anything. I just watch them, and it works. So you’re right, there’s probably a tradeoff. It’s probably pretty hard to measure. But what we’re looking for here is that people are actually using their time well.</p><p><strong>I want to try to tie all of these themes and ideas together. You have a big vision for Duolingo. You’ve talked about it a lot. Being available to teach everybody languages around the world, being in a number of countries. And then there’s the fact that you’re a public company. You’ve got to make money. You’re still showing up in T-shirts. The first thing that comes immediately to my mind is, you’re launching new things like math and music, and they’re not available on Android, which is the </strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/"><strong>single most popular operating system in the world</strong></a><strong>. It’s used by the majority of lower-income people in the world. That feels like an immediate tension, that the best experience of Duolingo is on the platform that wealthier people use. How do you resolve that?</strong></p><p>It’s a good point. First of all, math and music are about to be available on Android, or by the time this airs, they <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/duolingo-math-music-lessons-arrive-on-android/">will be available on Android</a>. We are about a year behind on Android. This has been true on Duolingo almost since the beginning. Android has been six months to a year behind iOS. There are a number of reasons for that, but probably the biggest one is that it has been harder to find really good Android developers when compared to iOS developers. There are just more really good iOS developers, so we have more of them at Duolingo.</p><p>The way we work is that we experiment with most new features on iOS. Because a new feature is usually not that great off the bat, you usually have to do trial and error to try to make it better. By the time it’s good, we port it to Android. That’s how we operate.</p><p>We understand the importance of Android. You are right. There are more people with Android phones than iPhones. Generally, all features are going to make it to Android, just about six months behind, and we feel okay about that. It’s also easier to develop on iOS for a number of reasons, not just that there are more developers. So that’s it, we’re just ahead.</p><p>In retrospect, given the technology that there is today, maybe we would be doing something that is cross-platform where we develop on all platforms at the same time, but we’re locked into being native on both ends. We have a native app for iPhones and we have a native app for Android phones. That was the best thing we could do 10 years ago, and we’re locked into that.</p><p><strong>When you think about growing the company, supporting multiple platforms, that’s just double the effort all the time. Is it on your mind that, “Okay, we’re going to intentionally slow down development here so we can keep this team smaller”?</strong></p><p>It is, and we don’t have one huge project where we’re going to stop all development and be like, “You know what? We’re going to now be in a single platform kind of thing.” But we are slowly getting there. I don’t know how long it’ll take. The hard part with this is that if we were to start from scratch right now, the decision would be clear, but you also have to keep the plane going. It’s such a big investment to do this that we will probably have to stop all development for a year and a half or something. I don’t even know the timeline because it’s just so big. So far, we have decided to do this piecemeal rather than all at once.</p><p><strong>Your premium subscription tier, </strong><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/duolingos-max-subscription-uses-gpt-4-for-ai-powered-language-learning"><strong>the Max tier</strong></a><strong>, only just arrived on Android.</strong></p><p>Literally in the last few days.</p><p><strong>One thing I’ve heard over and over again since the dawn of the modern smartphone is that </strong><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/06/iphone-users-spend-apps/"><strong>iOS users spend more money</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Yes, four times as much. At least for Duolingo, a given user spends four times as much per capita.</p><p><strong>So the majority of your money is coming from iOS users, is what I’m getting from this.</strong></p><p>Yes. More of our money comes from iOS than from Android. Even though we have more Android users than iOS users. It’s just hard to overcome that 4x.</p><p><strong>Is that demographically that they have 4x the income? Or is it that demographically, iOS users are spending four times the money in your app?</strong></p><p>No, it’s 4x the income. It’s that a user spends four times as much. We have more Android users, but it doesn’t balance out in the end. We make more money from iPhone. I’m going to give you a number here just to give you an idea. The split of users is 60 / 40, so 60 percent Android, 40 percent iOS. The split of revenue is the other way around. It’s basically 60 percent iOS, 40 percent Android. Those are very rough estimates.</p><p><strong>So when you think about expansion, again, a public company, if most of your users are on Android and Android is the biggest operating system in the world but all of your money is on iOS, how do you resolve that tension?</strong></p><p><strong>Is it that we’re going to make our money on iOS and not Android? The big mission is to bring free language education to all of those other people, so is the iOS user subsidizing the free mission?</strong></p><p>I mean, that’s one way of thinking about it. It’s not quite true that all our money is on iOS. It’s just that <em>more </em>money is on iOS, that’s for sure. But it is a little bit true, regardless of Android versus iOS, if you just look at who pays for Duolingo at the moment, they are usually people who are well off. They may not be millionaires, but they are people who live in countries like the US that are wealthy, countries that have salaries like $100,000 a year. A person with a good, stable job in a wealthy country, that is who pays for Duolingo. The people who use Duolingo for free are usually in poor countries. They may not have a stable job, so it is true that we’re getting the wealthy people to subsidize the education for everybody. That is the case, and that’ll probably always be the case.</p><p>Now, on our end, we also need to get better as a business to get more people in some of these developing countries to pay. As a good example, Netflix has done a really good job of getting people in Brazil and India to pay. We have not done as good of a job, and part of the issue is that we’re freemium. Again, I grew up in a poor country. Even if the price is scaled down to match the GDP per capita and it’s much cheaper, the problem that you have in a poor country is that the attitude is, “I won’t pay unless I have to.” That’s just the attitude. It doesn’t matter if it’s just a dollar, and I do happen to have a dollar. I just won’t pay unless I have to.</p><p>What you see is extreme tolerance for ads. For example, we can put 10 ads at the end of a lesson and they still won’t pay. This is why, for example, Netflix does so well in some of these countries because, with Netflix, there’s no free. They’re just like, “Look, whatever, you have to pay.” And people are like, “Fine, fine. I’ll pay.” So we have to figure out what to do as a freemium product in these countries, and we have some ideas, but the reality is, we have not really succeeded at strong monetization in countries like India.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think that that is the next logical place for you to grow as you think about English education?</strong></p><p>For sure, we are spending a lot of effort on that. And it is growing, which is nice, but it’s a massive opportunity. Language learning is another funny thing where the largest market is a country like the US: rich countries. Language learning as a whole, not Duolingo, but language learning as a whole, the largest market is actually developing countries: the Indias, Vietnams, Brazils, and Mexicos of the world. They’re learning English, and that’s the largest language-learning market, but we have not cracked it. We have cracked the smaller one, which is the US and Western Europe and richer countries. We’ve cracked that in terms of monetization and in terms of users. We have a lot of users in India; they just don’t pay us.</p><p><strong>I feel like I have to ask you about the owl. It’s very important to everyone that I ask you about the owl. At least as expressed in this country, the owl is </strong><a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/how-duolingo-is-using-its-unhinged-content-with-duo-the-owl-to-make-people-laugh-on-tiktok/"><strong>a very online, very culturally defined character</strong></a><strong>. If you took the owl outside of United States social networks and dropped it anywhere else, it wouldn’t make any sense. Is the owl expressed culturally in different markets, or is it just one owl?</strong></p><p>I don’t know how to answer the question. It’s in between. We started using social media with the owl a while ago. It grew mostly in the US through TikTok because the owl does unhinged stuff on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Wait, hold on. The <em>owl </em>doesn’t do anything. How big is the team that writes and performs the owl?</strong></p><p>Five people.</p><p><strong>Okay. And they work at Duolingo?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I’m assuming they’re in New York City?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Actually, no. Most of them are in Pittsburgh.</p><p><strong>Okay. I didn’t realize Pittsburgh had this many terminally online people. Godspeed.</strong></p><p>Yes. But it started out <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo">with TikTok</a> and it was mainly in the US. That was several years ago. What has changed in that time is, first of all, we are no longer just relying on TikTok. It is now on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40duolingo">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40duolingo%2Fshorts">YouTube Shorts</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/duolingo/reels/">Instagram</a>, etc. So it’s everywhere on social media. That’s one big thing. The other one is that we learned how to localize this to different markets. So we started Duolingo accounts for a bunch of countries: Mexico — well, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingoespanol">Spanish speaking</a> — <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingojapan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingobrasil">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingodeutschland">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingofrance">France</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duollingochina">China</a>, etc. We have figured out how to make all of them succeed. I was dubious at first when somebody told me we were going to open an account in Germany. No offense to Germans, but I thought, “These people don’t have a sense of humor.”</p><p><strong>Oh my gosh.</strong></p><p>But it turned out—</p><p><strong>They do.</strong></p><p>They do! In fact, it’s one of our more successful accounts. [The international accounts] are a little different. It’s not that different, but they are a little different.</p><p><strong>And these are the same five people locally?</strong></p><p>No, we have a global team, which is these five people, and in each country, we have a small number of people, probably one or two people, that localize this stuff. And “localize” doesn’t mean we take the exact same videos and in Mexico put a sombrero on. That’s not that. We have themes and we have figured out what themes work globally and also what themes work in certain countries. For example, the German one, we had a really big thing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingodeutschland/video/7281331111907642657">on Oktoberfest</a>. Also, at some point, because there’s this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingodeutschland/video/7332132891289324833">dance club scene</a> in Berlin, I guess they all went to one of those 24-hour dance clubs. Each country does different stuff, and it’s worked out pretty well.</p><p><strong>What’s the hiring process like to be the writer for the Duolingo owl? Do you just read people’s Twitter accounts and say, “You’re unhinged enough to do this”?</strong></p><p>It’s a lot of that by now because we are such a presence online. By the way, I didn’t know this until recently but there are weeks when our video on TikTok is the most watched video on all of TikTok that week. That happens. By now, our accounts are so well known that we have our pick in terms of [recruitment], and a lot of people want to work for that team. Typically, we just look at what they’ve done before. It’s a small group of really good creators, so we hire from that group. Usually, these are pretty funny people that are even funnier online, but when they’re offline, they’re not as funny. They’re still funny, but when they’re offline, you’re like, “It’s you? It’s you who came up with that?”</p><p><strong>And you measure everything, it sounds like. Is this working? Are you getting lots of new users because of the owl?</strong></p><p>Yes, this works. By the way, this is not paid. All that social marketing is not paid. It’s free. We make our videos and they go viral. About 15 percent of our users are coming in from social media. Now, if you look at social media views of our content, which we measure in the billions, there’s a roughly equal number of social media views of our content versus the content that is about us but not made by us. Also, there are a lot of other people just making content about Duolingo, but they’re not us, and they combined have about as many views as we do.</p><p><strong>Have you ever told the team to pump the brakes? Have you ever looked at something they’ve made and said, “We just can’t do this”?</strong></p><p>Yeah. There’s our review. There’s an approval process. We’re close to the line in some of the stuff that we have put out, and we have in fact gone across the line and published things that we shouldn’t have. Since we did that, we now have a pretty strict approval process. This is a whole layer, and <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/super-bowl-commercial-2024/">the last step is basically me</a>. But stuff doesn’t come to me often because there are people before me, like the CMO, so there are a lot of steps.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the last one the CMO was like, “I don’t know. Luis has to approve this one”?</strong></p><p>I’m trying to remember what that one was.</p><p><strong>What’s the last one they convinced you to do even though you were skeptical?</strong></p><p>I don’t remember the exact video, what it was, but I know that the last one that I approved, I was wrong, as in, I shouldn’t have approved it. A lot of this you only know in retrospect. You don’t know until it happens because you put it out and then you see this reaction. I don’t remember what it was, but I know I approved it and I know I was wrong because I didn’t imagine that it was going to have that reaction. We haven’t had that many faux pas. It’s been like three or four videos that were like, “You <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2022/05/19/duolingo-amber-heard-252204">probably shouldn’t have done that</a>.”</p><p>The other thing happened about a year ago. We had made this crazy video. It was insane. We were a little hesitant about it, and we ended up cutting it. There are all these memes online about how the owl really wants you to learn a language, and it goes to great lengths, including kidnapping your family. This was a video about kidnapping, and we were a little hesitant about it, and then the October 7th attack happened, and we cut it. And then we cut it last year, and we thought, “Well, you know what? We may use it next year.” This year came along and again we cut it. And then we came up with an internal thing that a year when we can play that, it’s probably been a good year for humanity.</p><p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p><p>Yeah. We’re probably never going to play that.</p><p><strong>The world context of that one needs to be substantially improved, I think. All right, I have to end with a feature request. You’ve given us a lot of time, and then I’ll let you get out of here. We talked a lot about India. We talked a lot about emerging languages. Can you put </strong><a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/gujarati.htm"><strong>Gujarātī</strong></a><strong> in this app?</strong></p><p>Oh, man.</p><p><strong>This is the language that I can understand and speak like a baby, but I can’t read or write it, and I would love to close the loop.</strong></p><p>You’re asking for languages. That’s a hard one.</p><p><strong>It’s a huge language.</strong></p><p>I know, I know.</p><p><strong>It’s the native language of Gandhi, of the current prime minister of India.</strong></p><p>There is this unfortunate thing about being a huge language versus the desire to learn it. It’s a pretty big difference. Hindi is probably the one that has the most desire to learn it in terms of Indian languages. It’s a tiny number of people who are learning it. It’s got to be, I don’t know exactly off the top of my head, but it’s certainly well below 1 percent of our learners are learning Hindi. I’m going to guess 0.1 percent of our learners are learning Hindi. That’s the hard part about adding languages, that we have to maintain them, we have to do a really good job with them, and then, in the end, we just don’t get a lot of usage. So, sorry.</p><p><strong>All right. That’s a hard no. It’s one of the first times a CEO has given me a hard no. That’s again, founder mode.</strong></p><p>Well, it’s just really hard to say yes to. In the past, I used to say yes to this stuff, and we made a lot of mistakes adding languages that, in retrospect, we probably shouldn’t have added.</p><p><strong>Have you ever cut languages?</strong></p><p>We have. We cut, what was it? I think it was Afrikaans. But the cut in part was because there was very little demand. The biggest reason was it was just a low-quality course, and at some point, we thought this was a bigger brand risk than anything else. We made the decision, we’re like, “Well, could we improve it or what?” And we made the decision it was not worth improving.</p><p><strong>Do you think AI is going to help you add languages?</strong></p><p>Maybe, but unfortunately, at the moment, AI is really good for big languages and really bad for smaller languages. There’s a pretty high correlation with the languages we offer. AI is very good at the languages we have: the Spanish and the French. It’s not super good at your Esperanto or Navajo or smaller languages.</p><p><strong>AI is notoriously bad at math, or at least the current LLMs are pretty bad at math. Are they going to help you with that?</strong></p><p>The good news is that, in the constrained environment that we have, it can help quite a bit. It’s been helping quite a bit. A lot of the data that we generate for our math course is with AI. The other thing is, some of it is without AI, but it turns out, just computers are good at math.</p><p><strong>It’s funny how many times I’ve asked this question and someone fails to bring up the idea that there’s a computer. I’m happy you did that.</strong></p><p>Computers are good at math! And I understand AI is not so good at following a pattern or whatever. It may not be so good at that. But the data that we generate for our math course is a lot of stuff like fractions and multiplication. Computers are pretty good at generating that data.</p><p><strong>All right. Well, Luis, you’ve given us a lot of time. Thank you so much for being on <em>Decoder</em>.</strong></p><p>Thank you for having me. And great questions.</p><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder">SUBSCRIBE NOW!</a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The tactility of their terror and the immersiveness of their worlds can make it hard for scaredy cats to even give one a chance, let alone get through it. Beating a horror game is one of the most triumphant feelings you can experience as a gamer, as it marks not only your prowess with a controller, but your impressive intestinal fortitude. Maybe you’re one of the brave souls comfortable with playing games that terrify you, or you’re trying to overcome your fear and delve into a horror title you’ve only heard of, but never dared to play. That’s what this list is for, to point you towards the best horror games of the last 20 years.<br></p><p>There are franchises here you’re probably already very familiar with, like <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Dead Space</em>, which entered the pantheon of iconic horror games long ago. At the same time, there are games you may not have heard of, either because of their relative newness or their much smaller development team and budget. But the games listed here are the spookiest, scariest, spine-tingliest games we’ve played, full of jump scares, gore, and freaky little guys. Click through for our picks, in no particular order, of the top 20 horror games of the last 20 years.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s kind of wild that it took so long for a studio to make a horror game based on the <em>Alien</em> IP. You have a monstrous killer alien that can sneak around and pick you off in the shadows and a universe filled with grimy, cramped space stations. There isn’t a more perfect setup for a survival horror game out there. Thankfully, in 2014 Creative Assembly and Sega finally gave us the super scary <em>Alien</em> horror game we’d been missing. </p><p>Creeping around a (nearly) empty space station, all alone, while being hunted endlessly by an unstoppable xenomorph is one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever done in a video game. Plus, while it has some connections to the franchise, newcomers to <em>Alien</em> can enjoy it without checking a wiki. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754" target="_blank">And with the recent news</a></span> that we’re finally getting a sequel, it’s a perfect time to play <em>Alien: Isolation</em> and learn just how scary one alien can be. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><p>Capcom’s underrated hide-and-seek horror game is one of the harder games to play on this list. <em>Haunting Ground </em>is a one-and-done PlayStation 2 game from 2005 that was overshadowed by some of the company’s bigger games like <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>and <em>Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening</em>. While it wasn’t Capcom’s biggest hit, <em>Haunting Ground </em>has gained a cult following over the years and is still one of the most memorable horror games from the era. It follows Fiona Belli, a young woman who is kidnapped and trapped within a large castle. As she tries to make her escape, she finds an ally in a fierce but friendly German Shepherd named Hewie, who protects her from assailants who chase her through the castle grounds.</p><p>Throughout most of <em>Haunting Ground</em>, Fiona is helpless, only able to hide long enough to disorient the villains chasing her through the hallways of the castle. Hewie is her stalwart defender, and the two of them solve puzzles and fight off foes together based on Fiona’s commands, growing close as they try to escape the hell they’ve been trapped in. </p><p>Even in 2005, <em>Haunting Ground </em>was a little clunky to control—that only added to the tension back then, but might frustrate nearly 20 years later. However, <em>Haunting Ground</em>’s brand of horror remains disturbing to this day, as the threat of sexual violence is pervasive, which makes for a harrowing experience, albeit one not for everyone. This looming threat is a key piece of the dread and fear the game evokes, and if that sounds like something you’d rather not engage with, that’s valid. But <em>Haunting Ground</em>’s terrors still echo in my mind, and I wish it would get ported to something modern. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> was exactly what I needed in covid quarantine—a chance to prove myself after avoiding horror games my entire life. The co-op horror title from indie studio Kinetic Games takes the TV ghost hunter formula and brilliantly applies it to a game, one in which you and your squad of amateur hunters try to discover and banish a ghost from a domicile (before the specter drags you into the realm of the undead, of course). <em>Phasmophobia </em>isn’t going to blow you away with its graphics or gross you out with gore—this is about tension, about dragging out unease until you feel you’ll go mad, about being very careful what you say (because the game uses voice detection), lest you end up dead. </p><p>But <em>Phasmophobia</em>’s unique setup also makes for moments of hilarity that punctuate the fear—a teammate’s voice cutting off mid-scream as they’re killed by a vengeful spirit, or a bold hunter taunting a ghost with curses and insults. Playing alongside other people made me braver, allowing me to ease into the horror genre without soiling my shorts. It’s only gotten bigger since its debut, with regular support from the devs, so <em>Phasmophobia</em> is a consistently great horror game option when you’re in the mood to be spooked. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is a genuine classic from the PS2 era and a game worth playing even in 2024. However, it’s an older game and can feel clunky at times. Plus, you might not have a PS2 or want to mess with the necessary mods to get it running on a PC. Lucky for us, we’ve got a new and great way to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span> in 2024.</p><p>The newly released remake isn’t a perfect copy of the original game and won’t replace it, but it does provide a very close recreation of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> while improving the game’s controls, combat, and visuals. If you’ve never played <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the remake is a fantastic way to experience the creepy story of a man looking for his dead wife in a haunted town filled with monsters, fog, and broken souls. Just be warned that this new remake can get intense, so you might want to have someone play with you to help add some levity as you slowly work your way through its hellish levels. And maybe keep the lights on, too? — ZZ</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span><em> </em>is horror on a grand scale, a fusion of police procedural, supernatural scarefest, and existential journey of the self, with all the pieces fueling each other in a virtuosic kaleidoscope of tonal shifts, showstopping musical numbers, and confrontations with the terrifying doubts and insecurities  we sometimes face when we look inside ourselves in an effort to create something and send it out into the world. With this game, Remedy creative director Sam Lake and his team pull out all the stops, taking us on a breathtaking odyssey that weaves together threads from all of Lake’s work over the past 20-plus years as one of the most distinctive creators in gaming. More than a scary game, it’s a daring and exhilarating narrative masterpiece with fantastic details and wonderful surprises awaiting around every turn. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>Full disclosure: I don’t love the <em>Zero Escape </em>series. I feel Spike Chunsoft’s escape room death game series lacks the thematic cohesion I need from the genre and relies mostly on narrative gymnastics and plot twists rather than a centralized idea. However, the first game, <em>999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors </em>struck a good balance, before its sequels came along made an already complicated premise more so. <em>999</em> is a much more concise experience than its follow-ups that captures the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped in one place with a bunch of strangers. Nine people wake up on a sinking ship and are forced by a masked individual named Zero to take part in a series of escape rooms before the ship is lost to the great blue sea. But to what end? That’s the question that lingers as tensions rise and doubts manifest between the group. But they must still work together to move forward.<br></p><p><em>999</em>’s escape rooms are full of brain teasers and puzzles that are satisfying to unravel, but its best moments are all the horrifying reveals that follow every unlocked door. There’s a lot of complex science fiction holding up the visual novel’s brutal violence and terrifying discoveries, but in the margins of all that, the game also elevates a human story of connection across space and time. If you want to see more like it, there are two sequels, though neither hit anywhere near as hard as <em>999</em>’s final stretch. The game has been ported to several platforms, but none capture the razor-sharp tension as well as the original DS release. — KS</p></div><div><p>You can’t have a list of scary games without including at least one <em>Resident Evil</em> entry. Capcom’s long-running survival horror franchise has produced some truly scary classics (and some stinkers, too) so picking just one was hard. But, I think <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> is the scariest entry in the franchise.</p><p>The switch to first-person not only shook up the series, which had long been third-person, but also made it feel like you were truly stuck in the horrible situation Ethan Winters finds himself in during <em>RE7</em>. With that switch to first-person, <em>RE7 </em>also returned to a slower pace and a bigger focus on creepy moments and scares over action and gunplay. The end result is a nail-bitingly tense survival horror game that reinvigorated the series and provided us with one of the best VR horror games around. (<em>RE7</em> is still great on a flatscreen, too, though!) — ZZ</p></div><div><p><em>Little Nightmares </em>is a solid game, but <em>Little Nightmares 2</em> expands on the previous horror puzzle-platformer in clever ways, with more intricate puzzles, even more impressive visuals, and a co-op mechanic. As someone who is a pretty poor platform game player (I rush too much), making players do tricky platforming while scared is such a brilliant conceit and <em>LN2</em> executes it incredibly. </p><p>The sequel introduces a new protagonist, Mono, though it also brings back the first game’s lead, Six, as the other playable character. While traveling through a forest laden with traps, Mono discovers a creepy old house filled with decaying meat, scary mannequins, and Six, who is being held hostage. From then on, Six is with you—though not all the time. <em>Little Nightmares 2</em> lets you play through much of the game with an emotional support character, which helps things feel less scary as you’re not entirely alone—but when Six and Mono are separated, the fear creeps up the back of your throat like bile. — AM</p></div><div><p><em>Dead Space </em>was a revelation when it landed in 2008. It had  outstanding visual design, brilliantly working protagonist Isaac Clarke’s health meter into the spine of his suit (or RIG). The way you use repurposed mining tools to slice the deadly appendages off of the horrifying necromorphs who want nothing more than to slice you open set its combat apart from that in other survival horror games of the era. Yet at the same time, it smartly took some cues from games like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, hitting that sweet spot of making your weapons and attacks feel satisfyingly powerful in certain contexts, while also making you feel constantly threatened. In other words, it took familiar concepts and mechanics but put just enough of a twist on them to establish itself as a true original.</p><p>However, when I think about what really made the first <em>Dead Space </em>so exceptional, I think that, more than anything else, it was its incredible setting. The USG Ishimura feels in many ways like a real, functional ship, a space in which people lived and worked before all hell broke loose, not just a series of linked video game environments. Though the Ishimura is a very different ship from the Nostromo of <em>Alien</em>, it shares a believable functionality with that space, which is essential to making the horrors lurking in its dark and derelict corridors that much more grounded and unsettling. Thankfully, the 2023 remake leaves everything that works best about <em>Dead Space </em>mostly untouched, so you can still experience its brilliance today, with visuals that are more up to modern standards. — CP</p></div><div><p>You’re in a dimly lit apartment hallway. A storm outside is savaging the windows and walls of the building, threatening to tear it down to the studs. The walls of the tenement seem rotten—not like they’re infested with mold, but like they bear the scars of something sinister. They’re barely containing the evil of this place. As you walk forward, you make out family pictures on the cabinet and a clock shows that it’s nearly midnight. A broadcast is playing over the radio; a man has killed his wife and kids. As you proceed down to the end of the hallway, a lamp swings and creaks overhead, a room with a dingy bulb greets you, and as you pass through it, you find yourself back at the very start of the hallway. Welcome to hell.</p><p>While it seems deceptively sparse, Hideo Kojima’s <em>P.T </em>houses a whole range of nightmares within its precious few walls. Along the way, it also redefined horror games, even though it was ultimately a teaser for a game that’d regrettably never come to be. Though Konami would deprive the world of <em>Silent Hills</em>—a joint collaboration between Kojima and the filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro—<em> </em>before it could ever come to fruition, we were left with <em>P.T</em>, which has gone on to become a legend around these parts. Unceremoniously dropped in the middle of E3, the teaser, which wasn’t initially revealed as either a <em>Silent Hill </em>or Kojima game, puzzled players for weeks. Successive loops through its haunted halls revealed many mysteries, ghastly sounds, and repeated run-ins with Lisa, a monstrous ghoul that has influenced <em>many </em>horror game creatures since 2014. And that’s really the thing about <em>P.T</em>: everyone was so stoked on its haunting first-person presentation, production values, and themes that its eventual cancellation left a void that’d be filled by games and creators who took it upon themselves to take up the mantle. It’s almost assuredly the single-most defining horror game of the 2010s, even if it can be finished in about a half hour.<br></p><p>Following <em>Silent Hills</em>’ cancellation, <em>P.T </em> was removed from the PlayStation Store, magnifying the value of systems that still had the teaser by tenfold. It was already a hit, but the move turned <em>P.T </em>into the stuff of legends. And you now have it to thank for countless of the best horror games that have come out since, like <em>Resident Evil 7</em>, which took a similar tact to <em>P.T </em>by releasing a horrifying slow burn of a demo and reimagining the series as a first-person survival horror experience. Thank you, <em>P.T</em>, I’m so sorry we never got to see what could’ve been. — Moises Tavares<br></p></div><div><p>You might think a first-person melee-focused Xbox 360 launch game couldn’t be a very scary horror game, but you’d be wrong. <em>Condemned: Criminal Origins</em> puts you in the shoes of an FBI agent who is investigating a murder spree and ends up getting wrapped up in the action and framed for killing someone. What follows is a tense adventure as the agent tries to find the real killer while fighting numerous people using various melee items. The combat in <em>Condemned </em>is messy, heavy, slow, and dangerous. And because you can only carry one weapon at a time, you sometimes have to work with whatever you have during ambushes.</p><p>It’s a shame that beyond one (also good) sequel, <em>Condemned</em> has been left to rot in a ditch by Sega. This could have been the start of a popular survival horror series with sequels and spin-offs, but instead, it’s mostly been forgotten and is hard to play in 2024. Your best bet is to play it on PC using fan mods and tweaks to make it run. A tragic fate for a fantastic horror game. — ZZ</p></div><div><p><em>Until Dawn </em>is <em>the</em> definitive recommendation that I make to anyone looking for a horror game, because it’s as close to classic campy horror as you can get. There are horny teenagers, a cabin in the woods that’s on top of a snowy mountain, and a jock, cheerleader,  goody-goody, and every other archetype imaginable. To make things even better, there’s a nearby asylum that was abandoned, a creepy groundskeeper, and the uneasy feeling of <em>something</em> in the woods watching our delightful cast of rowdy teens. It’s got it all and then some.<br></p><p><em>Until Dawn </em>plays like a cinematic adventure game (think <em>Heavy Rain </em>or even Telltale’s catalog) where different chapters drop you into the perspectives of the star-studded cast, including Hayden Panettiere (<em>Heroes</em>), Brett Dalton (<em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D</em>), and Jordan Fisher (<em>Hadestown</em>) as they try to separately make it through the night. As the title suggests, the characters need to survive the schlocky writing and terrors of the mountain till morning, and true to the games I mentioned earlier, the story can go in just about any direction, including countless ones that end in the main cast getting ripped to shreds by the harsh environment, the game’s central threat, or even each other! It’s a single-player game, but <em>Until Dawn </em>really thrives in group settings where everyone treats it like one big interactive horror movie. Have some drinks, make some snacks, and decide on the fate of these poor bastards in one of the best party games and horror games of the last generation. — MT<br></p></div><div><p>Black Tabby Games’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305"><em>Slay the Princess</em></a></span><em> </em>remains one of the best games of 2023, and it’s about to get an updated <em>Pristine Cut </em>on October 24. The visual novel begins with a simple premise: You’re walking to a cabin in the woods and a narrator tells you a princess awaits in the dungeon below. She will destroy the world if she is able to escape, so it’s up to you to slay her. But that’s a lot to ask of someone and expect them to just go along with it. So what do you do? Are you just going to grab a knife and kill her without a second thought? Could you ask her questions about her alleged plans to destroy the world? What if you just turned around and walked into the woods instead? You can make all these choices, but one way or another, blood will be spilled.<br></p><p>Then, the night loops. You’re walking through the forest again, being told the same spiel again. But some things are different. The furniture on the cabin’s first floor has shifted, but you’re assured that the princess you’re meant to slay is still downstairs. Strangely, however, she never appears the same way twice. She contorts into new monstrous forms, each time inflicting a new horror on you as you repeat the same loop over and over. At the end of all the carnage and horror there is meaning, but you must slay your way through multiple loops before you can find the rhyme or reason, and each route is masterfully written, drawn, and voiced to deliver a memorable, terrifying nightmare. — KS<br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-i-was-finally-brave-enough-to-finish-do-1836893812?_gl=1*wnjygl*_ga*MTM1ODc4MTMxOS4xNzIxMzEwNzc3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODY3MDQzMi4xMDAuMS4xNzI4NjczNjI5LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-later-i-was-finally-brave-enough-to-finish-do-1836893812?_gl=1*wnjygl*_ga*MTM1ODc4MTMxOS4xNzIxMzEwNzc3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODY3MDQzMi4xMDAuMS4xNzI4NjczNjI5LjYwLjAuMA.." target="_blank">I’ve written about this before</a></span>, but when I was much younger I played <em>Doom 3</em> and it scared me more than any game had before. The darkness, the sense of dread that filled each level, and the amount of gore it tossed at me left 13-year-old Zack shaking after each session. It wasn’t until 2019 that I finally beat it. And yeah, I admit it: Going back to <em>Doom 3 </em>after all those years, id’s spooky shooter isn’t quite the screamfest I remembered. </p><p>But still, <em>Doom 3</em> is a very atmospheric survival horror shooter that doesn’t turn into an all-out action fest until the later parts of its runtime. If you’re looking for a scary game that lets you fight back, <em>Doom 3</em> is a perfect choice. — ZZ</p></div><div><p><em>Signalis </em>is what I wish more modern horror were like. It feels lately like the genre’s chasing trends or ghosts, rarely allowing itself to ever be transgressive and bold. <em>Signalis</em>, which unmistakably looks and feels<em> </em>vintage, feels like the best kind of trick. Here’s a game that seems to be peddling one thing—in this case, PS1 nostalgia and classic spooks—and then twists and winds into something entirely different, radical, and endlessly more thoughtful than mindless pastiche.</p><p>If the fixed-ish camera angles and fuzzy CRT-like aesthetics draw you in, please stick around for the ride <em>Signalis </em>promises. It’s deeper, and a billion times more fucked than you might initially think, and its also just kind of the best survival horror game in a long while! If you’re looking for something that feels like the genuine article, this is <em>it</em>. There are environmental puzzles, riddles aplenty, and the inventory management in <em>Signalis </em>sometimes feels even more demanding than the games that originated and popularized the mechanic! It may be light on actual scares, but <em>Signalis </em>more than makes up for that in a billion other ways. I hate to say it, but it <em>might </em>just be a modern classic. — MT</p></div><div><p>It’s easy to forget now, after years of knock-offs, imposters, jokes, and parodies, that the original<em> Slender: The Eight Pages</em> was a really scary game. Released in 2012 and developed by one guy, this free horror game asked players to simply explore a dark forest and collect eight pages. The problem? Slenderman, a creepy thin monster created by the internet, is hunting you at all times, and if you look at him too long, you die.</p><p>While it’s a crude and wonky game made in Unity by one guy, <em>Slender </em>is still a very scary experience. In fact, the crude quality and rough feel only make it even scarier. It truly feels like some organic thing that just showed up one day out of the void, partially finished and waiting to make you scream. Even though the game got a bigger sequel and fan-developed spin-offs, the original is still the best one to load up on a chilly October night if you want some genuine scares. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>God, what a terrifying and devastating game. A domestic horror story about a family shattered by manipulation and tragedy, Red Candle’s <em>Devotion </em>pulls you in with the incredible precision and atmospheric richness of its details, and then scares the hell out of you. <em>Devotion </em>is about so many things—cultural pressures to maintain an appearance of marital bliss even as things turn rotten, the dangers of misguided faith and belief, the ways in which women are expected to sacrifice so much and men are expected to be infallible protectors—but most of all it’s about one specific family and its own very specific grief. That grief manifests in unforgettably terrifying ways over the course of this surreal nightmare, and in the end, <em>Devotion </em>left me as moved and heartbroken as it did scared. Horror games don’t always have to have incredible stories and profound meanings, of course, but when you encounter one that fuses amazing scares to a tale as agonizingly human and beautifully told as this one, you’ve really got something special. — CP</p></div><div><p>Hand-drawn and set in the Swiss Alps, <em>Mundaun </em>is a walking sim with obtuse puzzles but incredible horror vibes. Its grim, desaturated mountainsides are suffused with dread, its world shifting and transforming in unexpected and unsettling ways. The story revolves around a young man named Curdin who gets sucked into a morbid investigation surrounding the mysterious death of his grandfather. Things unravel from there at carefully paced turns that veer from subtle to menacing. The occasionally clumsy journey is more than made up for by the clever and satisfying conclusions at which it arrives. — EG</p></div><div><p>Playdead’s previous game, <em>Limbo</em>, was already a bit of a walk through a horrific park. A kid wanders alone through menacing woods, can be slaughtered by things like buzzsaws and huge spiders, and due to its monochrome aesthetic, it never really feels particularly inviting. <em>Inside</em> naturally ratchets things up, and as a result, it is one of those games you only really play once. Every second of <em>Inside </em>is still seared into my memory, and I revisit and turn over its terrifying and prescient visions in my mind all the time.</p><p>I don’t want to give away <em>Inside</em>. If you’ve made it this far without playing the game, I think you should just pick it up yourself and see what it has in store. It’s one of those once-a-generation kind of experiences. But you won’t regret it, and it’s one you can easily see through to the end within a single evening. Every next set piece is unlike the one before it, and its ending is an all-time moment in games, period. And just like me, <em>Inside </em>will worm its way into your head and haunt you for years to come like only the best horror ever manages. — MT<br></p></div><div><p><em>Amnesia: The Bunker </em>departs from Frictional Games’ established monster-stalking formula with excellent results. It follows a French soldier during World War I into battlefield tunnels that are home to a monster that can only be repelled by light. Generators keep the tunnels lit but run on scarce fuel; a crank flashlight is your last resort for navigating the environment when all other resources have been exhausted. The sandbox is as haunting as it is clever, with its best horror moments resulting from gameplay system collisions rather than scripted reveals or jumpscares. The tension-filled spaces and incredible audio design do most of the heavy lifting. It’s a refreshing twist on immersive sims in pursuit of an amazing survival horror experience. — EG</p><hr></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A trailer for Secret Level - the upcoming animated video game anthology series at Amazon - recently started making the rounds online, giving us a look at the show's cast.</p>
<p>The leaked Secret Level trailer surfaced via a Telegram server, which was then circulated by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trailer-for-video-game-anthology-series-secret-level-leaks-cast-includes-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-his-son">MP1st</a>. The trailer has since been removed in response to a DMCA takedown notice by Amazon, however Eurogamer managed to watch it before it was pulled from the site.</p>
<p>The video gave another look at some of the series' upcoming episodes, such as ones focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, MegaMan and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>. Some footage appeared to be unfinished, however, indicating there were parts of this trailer based on non-final footage.</p>

To date, only 32 Pokémon ever gained the ability to Gigantamax, the concept never translating to the TCG (which instead received VStar and VMax), and was replaced entirely with Terastallization in 2022's <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, in both the Switch game and card game.</p><p>As has become a strange but brilliant tradition, Niantic has chosen to announce the new feature in the form of a horror movie-like trailer, this time showing people reacting to what looks like an alien attack on their cities. Given the best of all the Gigantamaxes, Orbeetle, becomes a literal UFO, that’s pretty appropriate.</p><p>Then, with slightly disappointing cheese, we see world leaders calling on Pokémon trainers to step up and save us from these menaces, as a bunch of regular people grab their cellphones and look proudly at one another, most likely fist-bumping.</p><figure id="" data-id="616c4b25a02d7ba67d365186750c97aa" data-recommend-id="image://616c4b25a02d7ba67d365186750c97aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1543" data-height="869" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orbeetle in UFO mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orbeetle in UFO mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="616c4b25a02d7ba67d365186750c97aa" data-recommend-id="image://616c4b25a02d7ba67d365186750c97aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1543" data-height="869" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orbeetle in UFO mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It doesn’t show us <em>how</em> the feature will work in the game, but given <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-dynamax-max-particles-battle-guide-1851650328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-dynamax-max-particles-battle-guide-1851650328">the absolute clusterfuck of how Niantic added Dynamaxing without actually explaining any of it</a></span>, there’s a fair chance they wouldn’t be able to if they tried.<br></p><p>Yet, for all my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409">endless</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-shiny-celebi-whispers-in-the-woods-1851566355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-shiny-celebi-whispers-in-the-woods-1851566355">cynicism</a></span> about how <em>Pokémon GO </em>appears to be in some <em>Producers</em>-like quest to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2023-niantic-mega-diancie-rayquaza-1850780192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2023-niantic-mega-diancie-rayquaza-1850780192">destroy itself</a></span>, I can’t wait to add a Gigantamax Gengar and Snorlax to my Pokédex.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners—plagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair—pool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.</p><p><strong>Escape the Monastery</strong></p><p>Escaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Explore your surroundings and combine the characters’ abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you’re caught being somewhere you shouldn’t be, the guards will not be kind.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge the Madness</strong></p><p>To effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters’ mental health.</p><p>Each playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character’s sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.</p><p><strong>Discover the Secrets Within</strong></p><p>Choose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises.</p><p>Time is continuous in <em>The Stone of Madness</em>. <a title="Genres > Action [2,240 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.</p><p>Sneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters’ sanity.</p><p>Nighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about. But sometimes, the risk is worth the reward.</p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a Stunning Hand-Painted Art Style</strong></p><p>The visuals in <em>The Stone of Madness</em> have been lovingly hand-painted and animated frame by frame, drawing heavy inspiration from 18th century artist Francisco De Goya.</p><p>The game’s isometric perspective acts as the perfect showcase for the eye-catching visuals, allowing players to observe every minute detail and feel as if they’re adventuring through a Goya painting brought to life.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
