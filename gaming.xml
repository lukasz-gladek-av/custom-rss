            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year I woke up with the hands of an alien. Every item I grasped fell to the floor like so many grains of sand; every doorknob became a lock I couldn’t open. It didn’t hurt, but hundreds of dollars of scans later I learned my tendons were full of tiny holes, multiple ligaments were sprained, and my nerves suffered from a syndrome that sounds like a <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Double_Crush_Syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passable emo band name</a>. <em>It’s not unusual you didn’t feel anything</em>, my physical therapist told me. <em>In life or death situations adrenaline can mask the body’s sensations</em>. My husband had just survived cardiac arrest, and in taking on our chores, I’d dislocated joint after joint and shredded tendons like fragile threads, revealing a condition I’d long suspected but hadn’t confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Of all the big and small things we hoped for during recovery, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silksong</em>’s release</a> became weirdly totemic. I kept telling myself that surely I’d be healed by the time it came out, even as every follow-up scan simply revealed another injury in the wasteland of constant dislocations. <em>Silksong</em> announcements are so elusive; maybe my husband’s condition would even be healed upon the game’s eventual release. Probably, it would never come out. I’d spent the prior years editing at Polygon, participating in the inside joke of <em>should we update the </em>Silksong <em>article outline in case it’s announced?</em> before communally deciding it was unlikely.</p><p>Two rounds of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/plateletrich-plasma-prp-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRP injections</a>, a rotating door of exercises and medications, and finally life looks like a withered approximation of its prior self. And, just my luck, Team Cherry’s hit sequel arrived with two weeks' notice. <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie studios pushed their games back</a> in terror of being overlooked. Swaddled in our cocoon of chronic illness, I thought only of myself. Like a marathon runner butting up against a race she hasn’t trained for, I agitated about the lack of lead time I would have to prepare for a game this demanding. My hands, those dumb little paperweights, had only begun things like “chopping vegetables” or “typing on an ergonomic keyboard” a few months ago. Fine motor control was an event horizon I could hardly imagine, and yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My physical therapist told me I could play <em>Silksong</em>, just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23297244/elden-ring-hollow-knight-completion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not like I’d played <em>Hollow Knight</em></a>. This time I had to take ample breaks for something called proper tendon loading; playing it this way would even be beneficial for my recovery. In <em>Hollow Knight</em>, I’d simply thrown myself at boss fights repeatedly until I found the most direct way forward. I was so fixated on boss rushing that I hardly poked around the game’s map. But exploration is what finally yielded the game’s numerous pathways and secrets to me, elevating Hallownest into the land of favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve made my way through Pharloom, I’ve had to focus more on adaptability, giving up early before damaging hand fatigue as enemies whip two masks out of Hornet’s silk-starved body. I thought slowing down would dampen my enjoyment, but it’s made the game better. I notice more. I find more. I hunt for environmental clues, like deadly little arm bangles or a skeletal horse jumping over fiery ground. These novel attempts at moving forward have gifted me new regions and abilities, with the ultimate upside of flashpan moments of discovery and delight. It’s a counterbalance to the game’s punishing difficulty.</p><p>For the bosses I can’t weasel around, I lean on the humble nap. I’ve learned how to “pace,” the chronic illness community’s way of managing fatigue by planning ample breaks in advance. I give up early, hoping tomorrow it will be easier. Hornet’s moveset has a subtly different feel from the Knight’s, with her taller height, shorter dash, and toolkit. It took a few sleeps for it to sink in, but then again I am remembering how to use a controller in a very literal sense, which is to say coordinating basic walking and jumping.&nbsp;</p><p>My hands occasionally betray me with frissons of neuropathy that shuttle me into a knife-throwing Craw. I own an Xbox Adaptive Controller and the dongle that lets me use it with a Switch Pro Controller, and I plan on using it if I find any of these hurdles insurmountable. But an entirely new controller setup is another learning curve that will take me time to understand. I suspect a mix of both old and new setups will be the most sustainable in the long run. Mostly I’m glad to have options, and the patience to take my time figuring them out in <em>Silksong</em>’s world.</p><p>If doubling back bothered me, I would not be able to live in my own body, which flares and tears sometimes without warning. You can live life with this sort of condition in a state of grief, in constant fear of movement. Or you can celebrate every gain, knowing that you might not be able to consistently replicate it. The story of my guiding Hornet through the Marrow over and over — to collect supplies, fulfill Wishes, or simply uncover her dead body — is the same story as my fight to open a fucking jar. This fight started in May 2024 and, depending on which jar you ask, is still ongoing. I lived a year of having to decide whether it was more worthy of my limited stamina to hold my husband in a tight embrace or unclasp cold, tightened takeout containers to heat us up a meal. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I am no stranger to weakness that, with the benefit of hindsight, is actually immense strength.&nbsp;</p><p>It is pleasurable to finally pick my failures, and just as pleasurable to experience the joy of success. It’s also true that <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s failures are exceptionally funny. The series always had a mean streak: The Soul Master has a final round of fighting after a convincing fake out. Mirabelle the banker scams you out of Geo. <em>Silksong</em>’s miserly dramatics have only gotten funnier to me. Enemies that dodge your attacks more effectively? A booby-trapped bench that hurts you at a moment you really could have used healing? I have spent hours laughing, crying, laughing over the absurdity of getting stuck outside my own apartment, while holding the keys, because the gate is too heavy for me to open. Life has a mean streak.</p><p>The thrill I feel climbing Far Fields with my floating cape, beating a room of ants in Hunter’s March, or taking my first ride on the Bell Beast is even greater now, in the context of everything I have lost. It reminds me of how much my husband and I have clawed back from this tortuous phase of life, when washing our own hair felt like a cause for celebration. The more <em>Silksong</em> I’ve played, the more coordinated my daily movements of living have become. Meal prepping is a little easier; typing certainly is. It’s deeply imperfect– I’m in the middle of another week-long tendon deloading break after fighting a disgusting giant fly, but I would take breaks over long stretches of injury. To play a game at all is a pleasure. To play <em>Silksong</em>, however slowly and punishingly, is a joy.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls"><h3>Months After Microsoft Layoffs, Zenimax Unions Never Stopped Fighting For Impacted Workers</h3></a><p>They won more time at the company, improved severance, recall rights, and saved a few jobs</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/silksong-hollow-knight-rehab]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Team Reptile has just revealed its next game, following on from Bomb Rush Cyberfunk. The brand new game is called Hyperfunk which is being described as an extreme trick and graffiti game. Players can use a BMX, skates, or a skateboard to navigate the world of Hyperfunk while pulling off various tricks to fuel your boostpack, which will allow players to reach ridiculous speeds.</p>

<p>The description for Hyperfunk says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dynamic Style Wars, crews can take over areas and compete with others on their own</em></li>
<li><em>Challenge other crews to a graffiti battle, where you will compete in real time on who can bomb the streets best, escape police and claim the area</em></li>
<li><em>Strategically use 4 different types of graffiti to go over your opponents. Tags &lt; Throwies &lt; Pieces &lt; Blockbusters</em></li>
<li><em>Move freely around the city to grow your crew, find music tracks and unlock the other move styles</em></li>
<li><em>Meet random online players in the Hyper or hang out online with your friends in the streets</em></li>

<p>UK, Australia, and the US affected</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Eager <strong>Trails</strong> fans, old and new, are getting their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> today, the remake of the 2004 RPG from Falcom that kicked off the Trails series. With Limited Run Games and Clear River Games handling Steelbook and Bracer Editions, a lot of love and care seems to have gone into this remake.</p>
<p>But today, both physical edition publishers have revealed that they've hit issues in getting those special editions in the hands of some customers (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lz6vmo4zuc23">Wario64</a>)</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has been emailing those who pre-ordered the game about "unexpected manufacturing delays" for both the steelbook and Bracer Edition, and that these will now be "shipping out later than the initially planned date of September 19, 2025."</p>

<p>Over on X (formerly Twitter), European distributor <a href="https://x.com/clearrivergames/status/1968993500042547307?s=19">Clear River Games states</a> that "We began fulfilling all Trails in the SKy steelbook orders earlier this week, despite the games arriving at our warehouse later than expected due to production delays."</p>
<p>While it has managed to ship orders across the EU, the UK, Australia, and other regions, "complications with our shipping partner" have caused other regions to be hit by delays.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Clear River says it has finally found a solution, and the remaining orders will be shipped today. Hopefully this bodes well for Limited Run Games pre-orders too.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed the wait isn't too long for those of you who are big Trails fans — the remake has been getting rave reviews, and this is the perfect entry point for newcomers, too.</p>
<p>Plus, it seems like we're essentially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-contains-teaser-for-the-sequel">guaranteed to get a remake of the sequel</a>, given what footage has been shared online by those who go to the game early.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-new-sony-model-out-1000xm4-plunges-to-an-all-time-low-on-amazon.1302576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding the right pair of noise-canceling headphones can feel overwhelming these days: Every brand has half a dozen variations, and the differences are often so subtle that paying top dollar for the latest release is tough to justify.</p>
<p>Sony’s newest flagship climbs well past the $500 mark which isn’t exactly pocket change. That’s why the WH-1000XM4 feels like such an easy decision right now: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">this proven model is back on Amazon at an all-time low of $228, down from its original $348</a>. That’s more than $100 off for headphones that still strike the perfect balance of sound quality and features without being too expensive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why The WH-1000XM4 Still Feels Like The Smart Choice</h2>
<p>Its <strong>active noise cancellation</strong> remains among the best you can purchase: Powered by Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology, it uses microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate unwelcome sounds in real-time. On a plane, it calms the engine rumble to a whisper. In a busy café, it creates a bubble of silence around you so that you can actually hear the lyrics in your music or podcasts.</p>



<p>Sony quotes these headphones for 30 hours of playback which will even get you through the longest international flights without needing a charge. And just in case you do leave them uncharged, a ten-minute top-up from the included USB-C cable yields about five hours of music.</p>
<p>Controls are simple too: The touch on the right earcup means you can tap to skip tracks or pause, slide your finger for volume, or summon your assistant without having to grasp your phone. It’s the sort of thing that becomes second nature and saves time compared to digging for your phone every time you need to fiddle with something. Calls on the WH-1000XM4 are better than that: With five microphones built in and sophisticated signal processing, voices are clean on both sides.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant Sony touches is the Speak-to-Chat function: The <strong>cans naturally lower the volume when they recognize you’re talking</strong>. Imagine bumping into a friend on the platform of the train. You don’t have to fight for a pause button: the audio slows down so you naturally have a few words, then picks up again when the talk ends. Pausing the sound when you remove the cans entirely is another nice but very useful addition.</p>
<p>At $228, this deal on Amazon brings them to their lowest price ever.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting in January, students at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville can take an American history class focused on the Grand Theft Auto series. The course was reportedly planned to include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/">GTA 6 before it was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-gta-college-history-class-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spoke with history professor Tore Olsson about the class that's officially called Grand Theft America: US History Since 1980 through the GTA Video Games. The teacher discussed how popular video games can mold our real-world views, like Ghost of Tsushima with feudal Japan. With that in mind, "the class is much more about American history than the games themselves, but GTA provides the framework that structures our exploration of the past," Olsson said. "My hope is that after the class, students will never look at these games, or modern America, the same again."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Olsson is "perhaps most excited to use San Andreas" as a teaching tool from the GTA series, as it's set in a fictional Los Angeles. "It's probably obvious to many that this drama is an allusion to the LA Riots of April and May 1992, one of the most significant turning points in contemporary U.S. history, but also one that is widely misunderstood," the professor said. "Explaining the origins and meaning of this violent convulsion is a key goal of my class."</p><p dir="ltr">All of that said, actually playing the GTA games isn't required for the history course. Olsson doesn't want to put that financial burden on students and instead will showcase gameplay during classtime. The professor also believes this college course is the first of its kind, with only <a href="https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/course.php?c=73816&amp;cal=1&amp;d=3027&amp;s=1131&amp;y=90" rel="nofollow ">Wilfred Laurier University in Canada offering a GTA-related class</a> before (though not history-focused).</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't Olsson's first time utilizing a popular game franchise for a history class. In fact, the professor used <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-being-used-to-teach-a-college-american-history-class/1100-6487538/">the Red Dead Redemption series to tackle US history between 1899-1911</a> previously.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/">Rockstar believes GTA 6 will have the "largest game launch in history</a>," which isn't far-fetched. In fact, last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/">GTA 6 could be the most important release ever</a> for the game industry overall.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve played most of the Borderlands games, though I wouldn’t necessarily say I’ve always been a massive fan of the games themselves. I just like looting, shooting, and co-op, and these games always have those things. Frankly, even when I was younger, I found the humour to be something to be endured rather than enjoyed, but hey, numbers going up always feels good, and that’s pretty much the whole reason why I was looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Cinematic Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtSRtcXcCnk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In fact, I barely paid attention to any of the marketing because of that baseline expectation, which means I went in completely clueless about all of the changes. I had no idea the game was open world, that we would be able to glide everywhere, or that we’d be getting a grappling hook. I didn’t even look into the new Vault Hunters, because I figured I’d just pick it up and play with a mate on vibes alone.</p>


<p>So, imagine my surprise when, after a couple of hours, it dawned on me that this is easily the best Borderlands to date, and it manages to do it while having some fairly well-written and heartfelt moments. Sure, some of the humour is still grabbing for low-hanging fruit, but there are some really well-timed jokes from the cast that actually made me laugh. Out loud. Like the olden days.</p>


<p>It helps that the villain is an absolutely loathsome dictator too. The Timekeeper is a seemingly immortal ruler who controls the masses by implanting circuity into their nervous system via the neck. It lets him not only control them through constant monitoring, but literally take control of them. While I don’t think this is used enough in the moment-to-moment gameplay, like the synths being taken over in Mass Effect, it lends a lot of weight to the story beats. This dude is just all kinds of evil, and you want to take him out because of it. It helps that his sycophants are all just as horrific.</p>
<p>For as bad as they all are though, the people you’re fighting for are just as good. Sure, they’re all a bit rough around the edges, with Rush being a himbo and one of the other factions being made up entirely of toffs (they seem nice enough though), but they’re all likeable as well. It’s just nice to feel a bit more invested in a Borderlands game, you know? The character chatter is excellent too. All four of the Vault Hunters not only feel good to play as, and are highly-customisable thanks to three different skills and skill trees to choose from before you even start thinking about your gear, but they’re all pretty charming too.</p>

<p>It all feels good as well. The gunplay here is amazing, with the randomised weapon drops and the different manufacturers giving offering you different approaches to take for your ranged violence. The augment here is that you can now mix and match manufacturer mods, lending the characteristics of one style of weapon to another. Are you an enjoyer of ricochet projectiles and thrown guns that sprout legs and shoot at enemies autonomously? Just mod those onto the other weapons that you acquire with high stats. It’s a clever way of putting more control and player choice into the loot system, so you’re not so beholden to the randomisation.</p>
<p>The enhanced movement is also amazing, with the grappling hook, double jumping, dashing, gliding, ground slamming, sliding all coming together to give you so much mobility that you might not know what to do with it. You also have your summonable vehicle, so you can always get around quicker when exploring the open world.</p>
<p>The game has also run pretty well for me playing on PC. Unreal Engine 5 does come with a pretty heavy burden and optimisation can always be better these days, but turning down some lighting effects can give you big performance improvements and the game is still plenty enjoyable for me. I’m also very aware of the mass of complaints about the bugs and glitches going on, and ‘m absolutely certain those are true because the friend I’m playing with is suffering, but I’ve managed to artfully dodge those issues. So, in a very selfish kind of way, I’m all good.</p>

<p>I do wish the game had more music though. The big, wide world is genuinely quite rewarding to explore, with new discoverable locations, collectables, and more awaiting you around every corner, but it’s weirdly quiet. A Vault Hunter radio or two to keep the music going would have been a nice touch, especially as the music that is in the game is pretty good. It’s also really nice to look at. It’s easy to forget how much a stylised art direction can help make a game stand out, but Borderlands 4 does just that.</p>
<p>I really like Borderlands 4. I like it on the story front, gameplay front, mechanical front, and just all of it really. I have every intention of coming back to it and replaying it with the DLC characters in later playthroughs, and while the endgame stuff isn’t that fleshed out yet, I have faith that it’ll improve as time goes on. Let’s just hope everyone else can enjoy it without bugs soon too!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d88e5933be/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> surprised many when it was revealed at last week's Nintendo Direct; we've already got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">I &amp; II HD Remake</a> on the way, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">III HD Remake</a> is already out. Surely the next logical step is the <strong>Zenithian Trilogy</strong> - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/dragon_warrior_iv">IV</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_v_hand_of_the_heavenly_bride">V</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/dragon_quest_vi_realms_of_revelation">VI</a>?</p>
<p>Well, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii spoke about the upcoming game on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DaeJ3TFMFM">Yuubou &amp; Mashirito no KosoKoso Housoukyoku channel</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/18468-yuji-horii-comments-on-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-coming-before-dragon-quest-iv-v-vi-remakes">RPG Site</a>!), where he co-hosts monthly streams with former Weekly Shonen Jump editor-in-chief Kazuhiko "Mashirito" Torishima.</p>
<p>During a stream earlier this week, on 15th September, the duo are talking about the upcoming Dragon Quest remake, with Torishima casually mentioning the next one isn't IV, V, or VI.</p>
<p>Horii's response, around 44:45, is predictably vague (all translations by RPG Site): "A lot of things are moving around, but it was just done first by chance." So, does that mean more remakes are on the way? Torishima probed Horii, who simply repeated the same words, laughing.</p>
<p>Torishima continues to rock the boat a little bit by saying "It's like it does not mean that they are not doing 4-5-6", but again, Horii repeatedly denies, saying "I didn't say it" three times.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Horii starts talking about the remake — and the Zenithian Trilogy — to MC Naz Chris. "As I said just now, we want to make them playable on ongoing platforms", he tells her. And in response to her question about VII Reimagined "progressing smoothly?," Horii says the team has "a lot of progress" already.</p>
<p>But, like Torishima, Naz Chris can't help but give a little nudge, suggesting that Dragon Quest IV might "be taking more time" because of its "chapter divisions". Horii laughs in response.</p>
<p>It's definitely an odd choice to hop straight to VII after doing I &amp; II, but hey, we're happy to see the Dragon Quest series get some extra love on Switch and Switch 2. We do hope to see Dragon Quest XII in the near future, though...</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-closer-look">Square Enix posted a detailed blog</a> about many of the game's visual updates and changes, along with combat, character, and story details.</p>

			<p>Naoki Yoshida (a.k.a. Yoshi-P), the producer and director of Final Fantasy XIV, has confirmed that players don't have to worry about him losing focus or interest in working on FF XIV after leading the game for over a decade at Square Enix.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zydl9wAQuc">Noisy Pixel</a>, Yoshida was asked about what keeps him working on and staying interested in a single game for so long. His answer wasn't some grand response about his love of the craft or any philosophical exploration of his work. Instead, his answer (via a translator) was much more cut and dry.</p>



<p>"<em>I'm more of a businessman, and I make games, and of course people tend to say we're creators or creative, but I am an employee at Square Enix and I receive money to make games. I think my primary purpose is to make games so that we are delivering it to gamers out there, fans, players who want to consume our product. I think that is fundamental, or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong at this company.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And of course, working in a company and feeling bored with a particular project and starting to claim 'well, I don't like this game, I'm bored with this game,' then I think people like that would need to remove themselves from a corporate environment if they want to pursue that style. But I don't have that strong personal desire to go into my own creative things</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Yoshida continued to say that beyond the obligation he feels as an employee at Square Enix, he's not nearly done with the ideas he wants to continue to build and implement.</p>



<p>"<em>When asked do I ever get bored with Final Fantasy XIV, I don't think so, because there are a lot of things that I have yet to actualize in XIV, things I want to do, things I must do, things that require to be taken care of. And so, I think for at least a good while, I should be okay.</em>"</p>



<p>He did, however, add that he would change one thing about his role, which is to not have to deal with his administrative duties, and focus solely on game development. </p>



<p>"<em>I would rather not do a lot of management or operational things,</em>" He said. "<em>I already do a lot of game developing and I've sacrificed some sleep sometimes, but perhaps if I were to have a choice, I would like to focus in on the game development design.</em>"</p>



<p>It seems that Yoshida is more than content, continuing to work on Final Fantasy XIV, thinking up new ideas for it, and delivering a game that fans enjoy playing. If he's happy and content, why would he want a change? Just because he's worked on it for a while? That doesn't seem to be a good reason in his mind.</p>



<p>His response here further shows how he's consistent in his thinking that making a change for the sake of it when it's seemingly unnecessary isn't worth it. Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-playstation-6-final-fantasy-xiv-director/">last month in a separate interview</a>, Yoshida talked about next-generation console hardware, saying that, from a player's perspective, he doesn't see a "<em>real need to make new hardware, because I think right now people are happy with the Xbox Series X/S, the PS5, or the Switch 2.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When’s the last time you flexed on somebody about a laptop deal? We’re guessing — maybe even hoping — the answer is “never,” but if you’re so inclined, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">Amazon limited-time deal on a fully tricked-out Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen is a golden opportunity, because it’s being sold at a savings of over $2,000</a>. The bottom-line $900 price is a 70% drop from the list price of $2,999.</p>
<p>When we say “fully tricked out,” we’re being quite literal. It’s stuffed with max memory (64GB), max storage (2TB), and Microsoft’s best OS (Windows 11 Pro), which includes the elite-level Copilot AI assistant. Pretty much every bell and every whistle is included here, with a $400 accessories bundle thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Not a Retread</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for the “used” or “refurbished” or “dent and scratch special” tag on this Dell Inspiron 15, you’re not going to find one. It’s a brand-new 2024 model that’s fully up to date in every way possible. It’s not&nbsp;<em>the</em> lightest laptop around, but at just 3.66 pounds, it’s hardly a lumbering dinosaur. And the Intel Core i5 processor is competitive, with speeds up to 4.66GHz.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop is an obvious productivity superstar, with that processor and memory and storage combining with Realtek Wi-Fi 6 to power through remote work and as many work tasks as you can throw at it. Copilot AI will work wonders here as well when you need a hand with an Excel spreadsheet or you’re just not finding the right words for your email to the boss. It also has a 720p HD camera with a built-in privacy shutter, and MaxxAudio Pro stereo speakers for your Zoom calls and video conferencing.</p>



<h2>Time to Play</h2>
<p>All that speed and power and those hot speakers can also make this Dell Inspiron 15 a great gaming and streaming laptop when you’re off hours. The 15.6-inch display is full HD, with 1.4 million pixels and anti-glare coating to bring your games and shows to life, and if you cap off your work day with a long gaming grind or binge-watching your favorite new streaming show, the battery is up to the task, and Dell’s ExpressCharge tech lets you power it all the way back up to 80% in just 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Nobody will question your deal-scoring bona fides when you tell them the insane deal you got on this Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop. But you’ll want to tell them anyway: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4191/">This $900 deal is a 70% drop from the original price of $2,999, and that’s not including the $400 accessory bundle that you’re getting for free.</a></p>

"If something already exists in the world, some new person is not allowed to claim they invented it and get that protection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We call everything that already exists 'prior art,' and it would be ludicrous to exempt any piece of game design from that category simply because of how it's stood up in the software. The mechanism for access shouldn't really matter. It exists. It makes things like it in the world non-novel and thus not subject to protection. We don't give out monopolies to second place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Nintendo succeed with its claim? Mueller suggests it is unlikely, as courts typically reject any attempt to narrow what can be considered prior art — with Nintendo taking an "extreme position" here. But time will tell, as the lawsuit shows no sign of winding down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo's legal threats continue, Pocketpair is busy putting together Palworld's big 1.0 release, due at some point in 2026.

Accompanying that course was Professor Olsson’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Deads-History-Obsession-Americas/dp/1250287707/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1694531288&amp;sr=8-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Dead’s History</a>, and its <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Red-Deads-History-Audiobook/B0CKM6FB83?srsltid=AfmBOoo3lAx_1l2e1sHMPThec-pQNSrDmkCdg5O1H157pV_zBEZVa3z5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">audiobook narration</a> by none other than Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out, Professor Olsson had planned to launch his class with GTA 6 firmly under his belt, but Rockstar’s high-profile delay to May 2026 dashed those plans — just as they did those of so many video game publishers. So, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-says-gta-6-will-be-the-largest-game-launch-in-history">with what will no doubt be the biggest entertainment launch of all time</a> waiting in the wings, Professor Olsson will soldier ahead.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/18/409719-230329-red-dead-redemption-019-1758226311835.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Professor Olsson and students in his previous Red Dead class.

But perhaps most important of all, we ask the question: will playing the Grand Theft Auto games count as 'studying?'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What’s the basic idea behind this class?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson:</strong> Video games are great at conjuring fictional worlds, but they also impact players’ thinking about real-world times and places. And just as Red Dead Redemption 2 has shaped folks’ perception of the nineteenth-century American West or Ghost of Tsushima<em> </em>has informed<em> </em>their vision of feudal Japan, millions of people around the globe imagine contemporary America through the lens of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Just think of how many GTA veterans have recognized landmarks in Los Angeles and New York thanks to their hours in Los Santos and Liberty City!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my class, I take seriously GTA’s fictional representation of the United States: its characters, its urban and rural landscapes, and its storylines. And I use that world as the framing device for a serious history class that examines what’s actually taken place in the United States over the last half-century. The class is much more about American history than the games themselves, but GTA provides the framework that structures our exploration of the past. My hope is that after the class, students will never look at these games, or modern America, the same again.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/18/1920x1080-flyer-hist-150-grand-theft-america-1758226410066.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The flyer Professor Olsson will use on campus to advertise the course.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The Red Dead Redemption series, which you’ve worked with in the past, is obviously historical in its framing. Few people think of the Grand Theft Auto games in the same way. How can the GTA games’ contemporary setting serve as the backbone of a college history class?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson: </strong>Of course, most folks wouldn’t put GTA in the same category as games set in distant eras, like Red Dead, Assassin’s Creed, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance. But because the franchise is now nearly 30 years old, and because some of the early titles were set a decade or two before their release date, the games capture a particular historical epoch: the United States from 1980 to the present. Vice City Stories (set in 1984) and Vice City (1986) cover the 1980s. San Andreas (1992) and Liberty City Stories (1998) speak to the ‘90s, and then 3, 4, 5, and soon 6 provide different snapshots of the twenty-first century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really believe that the years between 1980 and today mark a distinct and cohesive era in American history. If we want to understand the divided and unequal U.S. of today, we have to grapple with what’s happened in that time. 45 years ago, the political fires that burn so hot today were much cooler. Most Americans got their news from the three TV networks – ABC, NBC, and CBS – which presented a very centrist spin on controversial topics. In 1980, the average CEO earned about 25 times the salary of their rank-and-file employees; today it’s nearly 400 times as much. 45 years ago, just over 5% of Americans were immigrants; today the number surpasses 15%. And the U.S. prison population quadrupled between 1980 and 2005.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, the America of today is unrecognizable from its 1980 version. In my class, we’ll explore how all of this came to change – and we’ll use the fictional world of the GTA<em> </em>games as the window for this exploration.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What do the GTA games get right in their portrayal of contemporary America? What do they get wrong?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson: </strong>Unlike Red Dead Redemption and other historical games, the GTA franchise is a satirical parody of the past (and present), rather than an attempt at faithful recreation, which means it’s almost a waste of time to list what it gets wrong. But just for fun… here’s a few. Every GTA game depicts an America plagued by violence and criminality. This is rather ironic given that homicide and car theft, as two examples, plunged dramatically from the early ‘90s until the pandemic. The games imagine an America largely without suburbs or traffic. (Have you ever actually visited L.A.?) They present a society where most women seem to find their primary employment in sex work, and where people of color are often gang members. It’s not hard to see the flaws (and ugliness) in such a portrayal. Or what about the fact that no vehicle seems to have door locks?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I find the games much more interesting – and useful in the class – when their parody rings true. For example, Los Santos, Liberty City, and Vice City are each home to bustling container ports – what 5 calls “the orifice of American capitalism” – that often sit near rusting manufacturing districts. This is spot-on: arguably no technology was more transformative of post-1980 America than the shipping container, which facilitated the global outsourcing of U.S. industry. Or there’s GTA’s radio stations, where much of the games’ sharpest social commentary takes place. In 4 (set in 2008) and 5 (2013), we encounter a highly polarized media landscape where rival political commentators spit acid at each other from separate stations. But the talk radio of the Vice City and San Andreas era are very different: here, an assortment of weirdos debate each other on a single station. It’s an interesting (and perhaps unintentional!) reference to how in 1987 Ronald Reagan began the deregulation of television and radio with the repeal of 1949’s “fairness doctrine,” which paved the way to overtly partisan networks like Fox News and MSNBC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you give an example how you plan to use the games’ storylines to teach historical content?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson: </strong>I’ve invested more hours than I care to admit in playing these games, and I’m eager to use their plots and characters to teach big historical topics. I’m perhaps most excited to use San Andreas, set primarily in a fictional Los Angeles of 1992. As many know, the game follows Carl “C.J.” Johnson as he returns to the West Coast, seeking to evict drug dealers from his neighborhood and then free his brother from prison, while crooked cops seek to derail his plans. The narrative climax of the game comes when these police officers are found innocent of their crimes, which triggers a vast urban rebellion against the miscarriage of justice. “Los Santos will burn tonight,” declares an in-game news anchor ominously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably obvious to many that this drama is an allusion to the L.A. Riots of April and May 1992, one of the most significant turning points in contemporary U.S. history, but also one that is widely misunderstood. Explaining the origins and meaning of this violent convulsion is a key goal of my class. Most folks understand the 1992 riots as a knee-jerk reaction to the videotaped police beating of Black motorist Rodney King and the near-total acquittal of the officers charged. But that explanation lacks backstory and context, some of which San Andreas hints at, but much of which is absent from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Immigration, policing, capitalism, drugs, government policies – these are all towering dilemmas of contemporary America. And it’s my plan to use GTA’s allusion to them as the entry point for a history that I hope will be fresh and timely to many students.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How can a less-than-serious video game be the foundation for a serious college class? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson:</strong> It might surprise or even shock some folks to learn of a college class built around the fiction of a video game, and especially this franchise. But video games have by now moved from the margins to the mainstream. Other forms of pop culture have made the same journey before. 50 years ago, it would have been unthinkable to find a “history of rock’n’roll” class at a college or university, thanks to the music’s edgy and risqué reputation. Today, that exact course is one of the most popular at my institution. Perhaps a generation from now we’ll see many more courses built around the digital fiction of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to GTA’s unique brand of unseriousness, I’ve certainly played enough to become familiar with its cynical, irreverent, and crude sense of humor. Sometimes this is amusing; often it’s not. In my class, I’m steering clear of the games’ most distasteful satire. Instead, I’ll be emphasizing the elements that are most evocative of big social, cultural, and political paradoxes – of which there’s plenty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And from day one, I’ll take great pains to establish that this is a serious college class that will handle weighty and difficult topics, which we’ll always approach with sensitivity and respect. I’ll make clear that my classroom is a professional environment for students, nothing like their friend’s basement where they may have played GTA for the first time. I’m confident that my 20 years of experience teaching challenging subjects – and my four years of working through such material via the Red Dead games – have prepared me to navigate the unique demands of teaching through a complex piece of pop culture like GTA.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the question of GTA’s nihilistic violence, which has been the subject of controversy many times during its career. In no way do I celebrate or endorse that digital bloodshed. Indeed, the core message of my course is profoundly anti-violent, revealing the common humanity and strivings of all Americans. My hope is that students will walk away from this class with the understanding that Americans are divided today because powerful forces profit from that division, and that a more harmonious future is possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Has there ever been a class like this before?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson:</strong> Not really! Certainly there have been other college classes built around pop culture, whether <a href="https://english.fas.harvard.edu/english-183ts-taylor-swift-and-her-world" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Taylor Swift</u></a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/04/15/126021569/tvs-the-wire-gets-new-life-in-college-classrooms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HBO’s The Wire</u></a>, and there are other historians who teach using video games – though it’s fairly rare to see instructors frame a class around one particular game franchise. There’s been a <a href="https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/course.php?c=73816&amp;cal=1&amp;d=3027&amp;s=1131&amp;y=90" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>game design course at a Canadian university</u></a> on GTA, but its goals are very different from what I’ll do as a historian. I’ve searched far and wide but have come across no previous examples of instructors in traditional disciplines who’ve made these games central to a class – which is rather surprising, given how astoundingly popular GTA has become in the last two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are students required to buy or play any of the games? Will playing the games count as 'studying?'</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson:</strong> I bet many students would embrace that kind of studying! But no, I’m afraid they will be disappointed on that count. As with my previous courses on Red Dead Redemption, I don’t require students to own or play the games during our semester. I’d be anxious asking cash-strapped students to buy a pricy console or gaming PC plus the games themselves. And I never examine students on the fictional content of the games; there’ll never be an exam question about Trevor Philips or Niko Bellic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that’s not to say that the games will be absent from the class – far from it. I begin each lecture by showing game footage or screenshots on our topic of the day. Sometimes I’ll pull out a controller and briefly play on my laptop and projector – perhaps loading shipping containers in the Port of Los Santos – before proceeding to the core historical content. I expect many students will be familiar with the GTA franchise, though ultimately their knowledge of game lore won’t do much to earn them an A. Yet I do hope that their passion for the games’ fictional world will inspire a similar dedication for learning the history that informs the games in the first place. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What is the place of GTA 6 in the class?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson:</strong> I had originally hoped that it would be a major part! I first began planning this class more than a year ago, when GTA 6 was scheduled for release in late Fall of 2025 – well-timed for the start of our semester in January 2026. Of course, the recent delay to May 2026 made that impossible. So yes, that’s why we got a GTA college history class before we got GTA 6! (I really hope 6’s release date doesn’t fall during Spring final exams week, because I’d be very worried about my students’ ability to concentrate…) I certainly plan to integrate the new game into future versions of the course, but for now I’ll have to rely on the older games. Thankfully that’s a ton of material.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is it a coincidence that you’re turning to another Rockstar game after RDR, or is there something unique about that developer’s game formula that allows a historian to base a course around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson: </strong>I don’t think it’s a coincidence. Few developers rival Rockstar in terms of the granular detail that goes into their games. But I also think Rockstar is rather rare in their eagerness to comment on the social fabric of American life. Their games – from L.A. Noire through Red Dead through GTA – are all interested in saying something about the unique strangeness of the American experiment. What they say is sometimes thoughtful, sometimes not – but that they’re trying is fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What advice do you have for folks who are curious about your class but are not students at the University of Tennessee and can’t enroll in it? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tore Olsson: </strong>First off, follow me on social media – on <a href="https://x.com/torecarlolsson?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reddeadhistory/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reddeadshistory" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TikTok</u></a> – where I’ll be sharing regular updates about what we’re doing in the class, and my thoughts on GTA 6. I loved the work of adapting my college class on Red Dead Redemption into a book for wider audiences, and it was a dream to work with Roger Clark as the book’s narrator. So I’m very much considering the possibility of doing the same with 'Grand Theft America' – perhaps with an equally perfect audiobook narrator? Stay tuned!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158947/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you asked me what sort of game genre I think makes the best use of the Lego brick-building format, I’m not sure I’d answer with a two-player co-op adventure game. But here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-voyagers">LEGO Voyagers</a>, a touching co-op title from Light Brick Studio (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_builders_journey">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>) that uses the brick-based gameplay to send you and another player on a small adventure.</p>
<p>Voyagers is a hybrid between a platformer and a puzzle game, utilising a very simple control scheme. You pilot either a red brick or a blue brick that live together on an idyllic little Lego island, and after a mishap nearby, the two bricks set out on an adventure that takes them to some strange and scary new places.</p>
<p>It’s strictly two-player co-op, so you can’t play this alone, but you can either tackle it online with someone or in couch co-op. The latter is how I played the game, over a couple of evenings with my fiancée. If one of you owns the game, a second player can also download a free Friend’s Pass, so that’s something to keep in mind.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158950/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Voyagers’ gameplay and tone are very charming, and it’s all helped along with a gorgeous art style, which especially shines on Switch 2. While the protagonist bricks have one emotive little eye, the world itself uses realistic lighting to make those plastic platforms look almost realistic, albeit made entirely of Lego. Adding to the whimsy of the two main bricks you control, you can press 'Y' at any time to make a little grunt or noise, and it’s always adorable.</p>
<p>Upon setting off on your adventure, it’s clear that Lego Voyagers feels a bit clumsy to control. Instead of simply running around, you must roll your individual bricks, with all of the resistance that rolling a cuboid against steps and other bricks brings. It’s often a mission in and of itself getting your little brick to the right spot, and while rolling them around is fun, this resistance occasionally gets tiresome, especially when trying to reach difficult platforms.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s not just platforming, however, as the game's focus is on the different little islands or areas you encounter, and individual puzzles. Each chapter feels like its own diorama, and as you might expect from a Lego game, you and whoever you are playing with will be doing a lot of building.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158948/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most puzzles involve you trying to get from A to B, and making either a bridge or some sort of steps to do so. It’s a concept that feels quite obvious, but is still really engaging. There’s just something so baseline enjoyable about putting Lego bricks together, especially when doing it with someone else.</p>
<p>To move bricks, you roll over to them and press 'A' to snap your red or blue brick onto them. Then, you roll over to your destination and press and hold 'A' again to assign a space for the other bricks. From this angle, you can quickly rotate bricks with 'X' and place them wherever you want.</p>
<p>This snapping onto bricks feels quite intuitive, and is essential to platforming as well, as later you must jump between ledges and use the snapping feature to move forward. It takes a while to understand, but it’s well executed. However, it doesn't always feel as tight as it should, and occasionally my partner had to hand her controller to me, as she couldn’t quite nail exactly what the platforming sections demanded.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158949/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, there are a few different types of puzzles, or ways to extend the ‘bridge-building’ concept a bit further, but ultimately, the game only has around two or three solutions you’ll ever need to find. Even when other things are littered around, the game mostly focuses on building a bridge or steps. This feels a bit disappointing, as with a two-player co-op title, I want the chance to communicate with the other player and solve a larger puzzle together.</p>
<p>Quite often, Voyager devolved into realising we had to build a bridge, and my partner just watching me do it because I found it easier to control. One puzzle involved moving a boat around to gather batteries, and the mixture of both players having to move the boat, and figure out the smaller puzzles around the batteries was a highlight, but a high that was all too rare.</p>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that Lego Voyagers is a ‘vibes’ game, as between the gorgeous visuals and the beautifully propulsive synth-led soundtrack, you’re probably just meant to experience this game together and enjoy the ride. We certainly did enjoy the ride, but compared to the constant ingenious puzzle-solving and essential communication of titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Voyagers often left us silent, waiting for one person to do what clearly needed to be done.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158946/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of the gameplay itself, the visual language of the game is often confusing, too. On the main menu, it is almost impossible to tell what option you’re picking, as the selected text just goes a slightly different shade of white. Then, in the game, there’s quite a lot of screen shake that made both of us occasionally feel unwell. And that extremely bright lighting gives an overly washed-out look, which also meant that often we found it really hard to tell either where our bricks were or which bricks we could use to move forward.</p>
<p>There is a really lovely game here, but before you spend £19.99/$24.99, be aware that this is around a four or five-hour game maximum, and two or three at minimum.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I adored Lego Voyagers' visual style and emotive design of the main bricks, I often found the actual puzzles underwhelming, and the game ended just as they started to get interesting.</p>
<p>If you ever find this on sale and want to just enjoy an evening with someone, this is a clever little co-op adventure with surprisingly touching themes. But when it comes to the difficulty of the main puzzles and the amount of content on offer, Lego Voyagers feels a few bricks short of a full set.</p></section>

			<p>Today, independent developer Keepsake Games is launching its debut game, Jump Space, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/jump-space-game-preview/9p95q2bl6gs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Preview</a>. At Gamescom 2025, I met with Keepsake Games co-founder and game director Filip Coulianos (who previously worked at Hazelight Studios with Josef Fares) to discuss this first-person cooperative space adventure game where up to four players take the roles of a spaceship's crew. The backstory is that evil robots have attacked humans everywhere in the galaxy and, as such, robots are the game's antagonists.</p>



<p>In Jump Space, the spaceship is your collective Diablo character. You'll keep upgrading it together as you complete missions throughout the game. A session starts in the hangar, where you meet up, customize your character, pick what ship to play and which components you want for the ship, and then choose the mission. The game is powered by the Unity engine and isn't that much of a looker, but it runs very smoothly, even at this stage.</p>



<p>It's best to immediately clarify that Jump Space is not some kind of sci-fi simulation game. Instead, it is meant to be very accessible, with highly intuitive controls. That said, every component of the spaceship is physically represented. You can walk up to the engine and uninstall it. If the engine breaks down in the middle of a mission, someone must run down there and fix it. </p>



<p>There's also a power grid where a block represents every component in the ship, and the challenge is to fit everything onto the green squares. If you have really powerful weapons, they will be very big blocks, and you might not be able to fit everything onto the grid. This means you have to really think about what things you can bring on a mission. </p>



<p>Keepsake Games also hammered in another key feature: the seamlessness between the inside and outside of the spaceship. Players can just walk on the outside, double-type space, detach themselves from the ship and fly around in zero G. If you hold SHIFT, you will start flying around. You can also board other ships while flying; it's all seamless. Lastly, there's a grappling hook-type gadget that can be used to latch on surfaces. It is very useful when moving in and out of the spaceship.</p>



<p>At this stage, Jump Space is a little barebones in terms of content, but it's also very fun to play. Depending on how well the developer is able to expand and improve the game throughout early access, it could turn out to be a very popular title in the genre. The game is currently $19.99 and</p>

<p><strong>Philip, what are we doing here?</strong></p>



<p>For this mission, we will travel to and defend a friendly ship that has been attacked by evil robots. To get there, we have to do a series of jumps now.</p>



<p><strong>Can you fly without people being seated?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you can, but then they would die. You'd have to revive them and that costs resources, so it's probably not a good idea. It's worth noting that with every mission, we don't really know what's going to happen because the map is procedurally generated, so we don't know what awaits us. We also share ammunition, so we might run out of that. But you can craft ammunition, components, weapons and stuff like that on the ship using a shared resource called materia. </p>



<p><strong>Can every player repair ship components?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we don't have classes in the game, so anybody can do anything. You can just drop everything you're doing and get to the most pressing task.</p>



<p>This is a mission in a super-compressed format with two jumps. Obviously, there can be long missions with eight jumps that last like half an hour. It depends on how much time you want to spend in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Do you also have missions on planets?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, absolutely. We didn't see that in here, but there are definitely desert planets, ice planets, asteroids, and moonlike areas. Roughly half of all the levels take place on different types of planets. Some missions are much more on foot, others are more on the ship, and others still are a mix of the two.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Roughly half of all the levels take place on different types of planets. Some missions are much more on foot, others are more on the ship, and others still are a mix of the two.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you have a randomized mission system, too?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. In the mission we just saw, all the jumps up to the very end were all kind of randomized. Even if we played the same defend the ship mission five times, it would never quite play the same way, and what happens within each level is also a little bit different every time.</p>



<p>Sometimes there could be very few enemies, sometimes it could be a lot. We also have an AI in the background that we call the Director, which keeps track of what we're doing. It could spawn various events that could happen, like asteroid showers or ion storms, if we're doing too well. Even if all the levels you're seeing are handcrafted, there's a lot of randomized aspects to the game.</p>



<p><strong>What about the planets in Jump Space? Are they randomized, too?</strong></p>



<p>The planets are handcrafted. But you can't fly around the entire planet, as every level is kind of a bubble. If you tried to fly in a direction, eventually, after a long while, again, the game would tell you to turn back. So, it's not procedurally generated. Nothing really is. We just have some randomization in the end, in sort of the composition of a mission and what happens within each level.</p>



<p><strong>I saw something like character levels. Is that right?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. That is kind of under development. The idea is that the more emissions you play and finish, the higher you can get with the level of your character. Certainly, rewards will be given to you, depending on what level you are, so maybe you get like a helmet at level 10 or something like that. We'll see how we developed that in the future, but for now, it's more to show off how long you've been playing.</p>



<p><strong>Would you get more powerful with those rewards?</strong></p>



<p>During the early access of Jump Space, we're going to work on allowing you to customize your character so that maybe you can add augmentations to your suit. Also, right now, you're stuck with one pistol, and maybe you will be able to unlock different pistols, stuff like that. It's not in the game right now, but it's something we are going to work on during early access. Right now, most of the upgrades are focused around the ship. But we can tell that players will really want to upgrade their characters as well. That's going to be something that happens during early access.</p>



<p><strong>What else are you planning to add throughout the early access phase?</strong></p>



<p>One thing the community really wants is more ships. We have two ships now, but we look forward to make much more in the future. Another thing is more missions. At the early access launch, there's only Chapter One, but with every big update, we'll add more missions with the story that finally concludes with us fighting against the evil robots. We'll add more equipment for players.</p>



<p>Another thing that's been pretty popular among the community is endless missions, trying to survive for as many jumps as possible. The game would never end up until your crew gets destroyed, trying to get as far as it can. Generally, we also want to expand the difficulty spectrum of missions, catering to both casual players and more hardcore players.</p>



<p>Of course, right now, we're releasing for PC and Xbox. We would like to release Jump Space on all consoles, but as we are a small team, we're gonna do one console at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Did you already think about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong></p>



<p>I mean, right now, we're open to anything. I think it depends on how well we are doing, how well the game is selling, and how well the Switch 2 is doing.</p>



<p><strong>So far, I would say the Switch 2 is doing pretty well. Anyway, do you have cross-play between the PC and Xbox version?</strong></p>



<p>We do not. We are just a small team and we have to really be careful about what we attempt to do. Maybe sometime in the far future. We want to focus on the game first.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have humanoid enemies as well, or just robots?</strong></p>



<p>No. We do robots, mainly because of production reasons. They're easy to make, while making humans is a lot more work. We would love to have like pirates and stuff you can fight off. I think that depends on how well the game is doing, and you know, if we can expand the team. Nothing is off the table, but it's just a matter of where do we want to put our money.</p>



<p><strong>How many developers do you have at Keepsake?</strong></p>



<p>We're sixteen in the office at Stockholm, and then we have some contractors, but the team itself has like 16 people.</p>



<p><strong>I know you've got some prior experience, though.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, I was a founding member of Hazelight. I worked a lot with Josef Fares on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Way Out</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. </p>



<p><strong>This is a very different game from those titles.</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. This game has really been something I've been working on in my spare time for a long time before starting the studio. I really love sci-fi. But the lessons I learned while at Hazelight were very valuable. Even though the games are different, there's a little bit of magic from Hazelight as well.</p>



<p><strong>What's the price going to be?</strong></p>



<p>$19.99.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to increase it after early access?</strong></p>



<p>That's the plan. We'll see how quickly or how far into the development of early access. It depends on the reception we get and how much content we're able to produce.</p>



<p>This is a co-op game, and you don't want the price to be why one of your friends doesn't want to jump in with you, right? We're quite aggressive on the price, but we're hoping to compensate by having a lot of people be able to play. We'll definitely announce way ahead of time if we decide to increase the price. </p>

We'll definitely announce way ahead of time if we decide to increase the price. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you think you'd be open to adding Jump Space to Game Pass and/or PlayStation Plus if Microsoft or Sony asked? Would you like that?</strong></p>



<p>Depends on the deal. We're open for anything. It depends on what deal is on the table. We're great fans of Game Pass, for example. We've been using, but it all depends on what we get in return.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support mouse and keyboard on Xbox at some point? </strong></p>



<p>Yes. We don't have it today, but it sounds like it should be pretty easy to do.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has released the first ever official music video for a song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, and the video sets one of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s most iconic battle themes to a very thematically relevant visual element.</p>

<p>The video is for the battle theme "It's Going Down Now", which plays whenever the party gets the drop on an enemy in the Tartarus dungeon in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>. If you're anything like me, that means you'll be hearing the song hundreds of times over the course of your time with the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, "It's Going Down Now" is the most-streamed song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>soundtrack on Spotify, having built up over 100 million plays. It makes sense, then, that this was the song chosen for the series' first music video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=HVo2nqiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=2wf_ubTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona</em>'s first ever music video is for a battle theme from&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The track was created specifically for&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>; it doesn't have an equivalent in the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>, which simply uses the equally iconic "Mass Destruction" as its general battle theme. That song still plays in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, but only for battles in which you don't have the advantage.</p>

<p>The music video for "It's Going Down Now" sees rapper Lotus Juice and singer Azumi Takahashi performing in front of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s famous Tartarus steps, which lead up to the dungeon proper. The video is also interspersed with other visuals you'll recognize if you're a&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>You can check out the music video for "It's Going Down Now" in its entirety right here. If you've played the game, it's a great opportunity to hear the song for that extra-special thousand-and-first time.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">a remake</a> of Atlus' cult hit JRPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>&nbsp;that boasts all-new visuals, gameplay improvements, and a rearranged soundtrack.</p>

<p>The game proved a success for publisher Sega and developer Atlus, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">racked up two million sales</a> around the world at last count. A remake of its successor,&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em>, was announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In case it wasn’t clear, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> made it obvious: at their very best, big-budget video games should be comparable to prestige television, so much so that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">adapting one for HBO</a> is a relatively straightforward affair. This bar-setting exercise is further exemplified by other PlayStation franchises marching toward adaptation: <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is set to be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch">film</a> and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://crunchyrollstore.sjv.io/c/482924/1941456/20100?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fnews%2Fannouncements%2F2025%2F1%2F7%2Fghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-series-2027-crunchyroll%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqRO6dRM2VdzQBXlAkJr6kS0nu4n2YPdzHlhw_-LTWt1frOto5M">anime</a>, <em>God of War</em> has <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-ronald-d-moore-amazon-series-showrunner-1236122550/">Prime Video aspirations</a>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, previously on its way to becoming a Netflix series, is now <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/">being adapted for cinemas</a>. It’s not an accident: games at this scale are a high-risk affair, too expensive to just be games.</p><p>Some developers, however, make it look easy by taking the exact opposite approach. Japanese developer Nihon Falcom, an early trailblazer in the RPG space, has steadily built out one of the grandest stories in video games with its <em>Trails</em> series. Thirteen games deep, the Trails games span the continent of Zemuria and the nations within it, juggling personal relationships with a wider interest in the march of history and how cultures and governments respond to the destabilizing advance of modernity. What Falcom has done here is astonishing and unparalleled for a single studio of its size — which, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-15/toshihiro-kondo-falcom-ceo-behind-trails-games-started-off-as-a-fan">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>,</em> sits at 68 employees — and it did so by resisting the mainstream gaming impulse to equate lavish expense with quality.</p><p>If most big-budget games are chasing the sensibilities of prestige TV, Falcom’s games are comparable to the soap opera: affordable, modest affairs that are not as widely acclaimed as their peers but passionately followed by a small but growing audience. (Sales of the <em>Trails </em>series sit at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-15/toshihiro-kondo-falcom-ceo-behind-trails-games-started-off-as-a-fan">8.8 million copies</a>.) What they lack in visual flair and technical prowess (which is a lot) they make up for in narrative complexity and long, rewarding character arcs (which is astounding). The pleasures of the <em>Trails</em> series lie in watching small-stakes hangouts curdle into gut-wrenching conflicts as characters’ individual struggles get subsumed by political machinations and ideologues who seek to hijack technological progress for their own bigoted ends.</p><p>Under company president Toshihiro Kondo’s leadership, Falcom has been working to grow its audience slowly, narrowing the gap between <em>Trails</em> games’ Japanese releases and their worldwide localizations, partnering with other studios to bring its older titles to modern platforms, and, in its most confident step of all, releasing a new ground-up remake of the first game to give the curious the perfect on-ramp. That remake, <em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, is more than just a reworking of a cult favorite. It’s a document of Falcom’s progress — the studio’s technologically crudest game remade with the gloss of its most recently localized installment, 2022’s <em>Trails Through Daybreak</em> <em>II</em>.</p><p>The result is spectacular. <em>1st Chapter</em> takes a clunky, patient turn-based RPG and transforms it into a slick and modern experience, incorporating 21 years of Falcom’s growth alongside innovations cribbed from other games, like <em>Persona 5</em>. Systems are thoughtfully layered to combine both action- and turn-based RPG mechanics with pizzazz; players that enter a fight with a clear strategy will be able to execute it while hardly feeling like they’re in a turn-based encounter at all. Those who like to take things slow can also kick it old-school, like nothing ever changed.</p><p>Of course, such an effective remake will then make things a bit awkward for those who want to continue on. <em>1st Chapter</em> is the first half of a two-part story about Estelle and Joshua Bright, adoptive siblings who join an outfit of civic-minded mercenaries and discover a grand conspiracy in the kingdom of Liberl. A remake of the sequel <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/the-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-sky-the-3rd-remakes-falcom">seems to be underway</a>, but after that, there are nearly a dozen more games across multiple sub-series, each set in a different region. Each sub-series has its own central plot and advances the wider <em>Trails</em> story, each presages future titles and references back to previous ones, and each is available on different platforms and has its own design quirks and difficulties. Playing them all can be a real headache.</p><p>Yet people still seek <em>Trails</em> out, still want to embark on this strange journey through Zemuria. Part of the appeal isn’t just the story being told, it’s <em>talking</em> about the story that’s told. The unique structure of these games allows people to talk to each other across the fictional time and space of its setting. Talking to someone who is a sub-series or two ahead of you, or playing out of order, is like corresponding with someone in another country: <em>Things are a little different here, but a lot of what you love is also present. Let me tell you about it.</em></p><p>Everything about this is deliberate. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hot-on-the-trails-of-falcom-japans-longest-running-rpg-developer">a 2019 interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Kondo stated that the studio’s founder, Masayuki Kato, made the express decision to focus on writing while others chased graphics. “As time progressed, other companies began putting a lot more manpower into graphics. We realised we’d need well over 100 people solely focused on that,” Kondo said. “But our founder [Kato] realised if we can get a writer who knows how to write good stories, and is able to build up their knowledge as a writer, that’s something we can make a sales point going forward.”</p><p>It’s not limited to Falcom, either. Other studios have found success this way. RGG Studio’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321087/yakuza-like-a-dragon-story-interview-masayoshi-yokoyama">sprawling <em>Like a Dragon</em> saga</a> continually wrings new flavors of gangster melodrama out of the same locations and characters, carefully expanding its scope to include new game mechanics and locales, finding new fans along the way. Similarly, Atlus built its massive <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> franchise on grueling dungeon crawlers that weren’t afraid to be quite similar, applying the designs of Kazuma Kaneko in new contexts, widening the franchise’s appeal by shifting genres and tones until striking it big with the most recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"><em>Persona</em></a> games.</p><p>This recycling of design work used to be frowned upon by video game fans and some press, who demanded some kind of graphical novelty accompany every release. All sorts of dirty words would be attributed to this process, from “asset flipping” to the more broadly popular accusation of “lazy devs.” Indulging in this attitude has led to the current graphical arms race, with its skyrocketing costs and widening gaps between new game releases. But there is another way. It’s a very old way, one that is reminiscent of the 8- and 16-bit eras, where technological progress was prized but not so ruthlessly pursued, because their visual fidelity had not yet put them in spitting distance of Hollywood.</p><p>Video games are not film or television, but they all can connect with people in ways indifferent to the money spent to produce them. For Falcom and <em>Trails</em>, it’s about building the most singularly sprawling story in video games, which the studio achieved by putting its resources where fans care most, and getting around to the rest when it was possible. And what’s incredible is that in spite of these games’ uneven visual quality, their niche anime appeal, the lack of a massive staff, and a frankly daunting number of installments totalling many hours of gameplay — the team just might pull it off.</p><p><sub>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter<em> launches September 19th on Steam, the PS5, and the Nintendo Switch / Switch 2.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/781492/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/781492/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>A home is where the heart is. It's also where crumbs drop, fester, and eventually attract creatures to feast upon it. There are piles of dust. Clothes pile up. Dishes stack. A home—an apartment, a room, a house, whatever—requires attention.</em></p><p><em>Rob, as you probably know, is beginning to grasp what it means to turn that kind of attention to a much bigger space than he's already known. There are going to be losing battles. You cannot keep an entire house clean. Instead, it's about shuffling priorities, dividing labor between partners, and realizing some stuff stays dirty.</em></p><p><em>So, sure, home is where the heart is. It's also where the dirt is. </em></p><p><em>Dirt is love?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Division of household labor has always been kind of fraught around my house. I was raised to do a lot of chores: clean the kitchen and bathrooms, wash the cars, vacuum the house, mow the lawn, do laundry, occasionally dust (I did it less than I was supposed to because I hated it so much). Somewhere in there I also became someone who was, if not a neat freak, sensitive to when things got a little too messy. At some point a threshold will be crossed and I immediately need to start cleaning up whatever problem I’ve spotted. MK, on the other hand, is oblivious to mess. It’s not that she can’t appreciate a clean house versus a cluttered and messy one, it’s just that if she’s got her mind elsewhere (and she usually does) then her surroundings don’t really register.</p><p>There’s the added fact that MK has some physical constraints around dysautonomia that make it tough for her to spend a lot of time on her feet. Basically the stuff that everyone’s nervous system is supposed to do automatically to even-out bloodflow in different postures and at different activity levels? Hers doesn’t do that real well, and will occasionally try and cause her to black out like a pilot pulling 7Gs because she stood up too fast. That means we have to be real selective about what is worth her limited time on her feet. Taking the dogs out? Not too hard now that we live in a house where she can just walk outside and not wait for an elevator. Dishes? That’s a lot of standing in front of a sink or next to a dishwasher. She can do it but it’s rarely worth it.</p><p>So we’ve always had to think about what is the extra stuff I take on around the house, and then what we have to offload somehow. Even before MK’s health issues cropped up, cleaners were a necessity for maintaining a baseline level of cleanliness around the house without us having to negotiate or nag at each other.</p><p>However, the new house poses new challenges. Our yard requires a lot of work if we’re going to keep it looking as nice as it has under the previous owners. There’s about thirty years of previous landscaping and horticulture here that has created a pretty idyllic yard but we’ve lived in city apartments our entire adult lives. I never liked yard work when I lived with my parents and, more importantly, I have no idea what I’m doing with flowers or decorative pushes and trees. Plus, the new house is much bigger than the old condo, and cleaners’ prices understandably scale with the size of the home. Having someone come clean our condo was a small luxury, not much more than splurging on delivery sushi for a night. Having cleaners fully service the new place would suddenly be like having a new car payment.</p><p>So we’re each going to have to do more, and that’s got me thinking about what are the chores that are easiest for me to do, and which are the ones I actually like the most. What are the household task power rankings?</p><p>I can tell you right at the start that cleaning the kitchen is S-tier. It’s something I’m good at, it can be really meditative if you’re giving it a full deep clean where all the appliances are getting unplugged, cleaned, and moved aside so the counters can receive a good scrub. It’s also maybe the most podcast-friendly task there is, so it’s easy to have fun paying attention to something else while I’m doing wax-on, wax-off stuff.</p><p>Garbage tier task? Weeding. This is more a personal thing for me, but there’s two issues. One, it’s all low to the ground and I’m tall, so it’s just physically uncomfortable and miserable. Two, I never know what’s&nbsp; the good-enough version of weeding a lawn or a garden. Do you pull out every plant that’s not supposed to be there? That’s a huge amount of work and might not even be appropriate for the health of the yard. But if you take too lax an approach, you might discover that the innocuous sprouts you ignored have turned into nutrient-sucking vampires who have metastasized into a lawn cancer around all the plants you actually care about. It feels like there’s a learning curve to it, but I hate the basic task so much I don’t want to invest the time into figuring out what is the stuff I have to do, should probably do, and can safely ignore.</p><p>What are your S and trash tier chores? You have any tasks you feel will “build character” if you make your kids do them?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Annie Spratt</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hah, my wife is the opposite. I have to specifically mark boxes around the house that I do not want thrown out yet, because it’s something I’ve ordered and I’m not sure we want to keep it. (The most recent example was an alarm clock for my nine-year-old that was a little wonky. I wanted to keep the box for a week, see if the device was what we wanted. I told her this. She still threw the box out a day later.)</p><p>Chores in our house are interesting because they’re divided by proximity. I work from home every day of the week, while my wife spends at least a few days in downtown Chicago. It means, generally speaking, I’m the point of contact for everything related to the kids (i.e. sickness, activities) and much of the day-to-day household upkeep falls in my lap because I can fit them in-between things during work.</p>

              <p>LEGO is easily one of the most beloved sets of collectibles. Just about from kids to adults love them. They make for great toys, gifts, or collectors items. But really what it’s all about is the build. Loading up the latest episode of your favorite podcast or the next chapter of an audiobook your working through while you sit at a table on down on the carpet, putting pieces together one by one. You watch your progress unfold in front of you as your mind wanders and you forget about the stressors in your life. You get lost in it. And then when you’re done, you have a cool replica of the likely the most famous spaceship in cinema history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">On that note, you can get the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set for 20% off in honor of Bricktember.</a> Yes, we’re pretending that’s a real month. For a limited time, the price of this Star Wars LEGO set has come down from $85 to just $68. You’ll be saving a good $17.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Nostalgia</h2>
<p>This LEGO Millennium Falcon is built to be display (but I won’t tell any one if you pretend to fly it around your bedroom while making the noises). When displayed, it sits at a dynamic angle like it’s taking a tight turn. The model measures in at just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and then seven and a half inches deep. It’s a great fit for any moderately-sized shelf.</p>
<p>The 921-piece set of the renowned Corellian freighter starship first seen piloted by smuggler Han Solo and his loyal companion Chewbacca has every part of the ship inside and out in great detail. Well, decent detail. To keep everything to size, the characters are all depicted with just two or three small round pieced stacked on top of each other. LEGO even decided to represent that weird holographic chess game Han and Chewie play in George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p>



<p>LEGO and Star Wars collaborated on this set in honor of the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars. Back in 1999, as a way to promote the new prequel trilogy’s first film&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, LEGO released its first Star Wars sets. Among them were an X-Wing fighter, a Landspeeder, and even minifigures of Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi.</p>
<p>And now here we are a little over 25 years later, LEGO and Star Wars are just has over thousand sets together — but we’re only here to talk about one set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/"> Get this LEGO Millennium Falcon for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is setting out to be one of the most interesting Nintendo Switch 2 ports launching next year, judging from the footage released so far.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> compared the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Nintendo Switch 2 version announcement trailer</a> of the next entry in the CAPCOM series with the same trailer captured on PC, highlighting how this port is going to be notable for how it has been built with ray tracing in mind and for how the Nintendo console will support RT in a seemingly competent capacity. </p>



<p>Comparing the two trailers shows how RTGI is present in the Switch 2 version, delivering an experience that looks very much the same as that on the other systems, although with some cutbacks regarding image quality, hair rendering, shadow maps resolution, and reflections, as this version of the game seems to lack RT reflections. Performance also seems to be a little unstable from the footage, but considering it has been captured on a pre-release build, there's a good chance Resident Evil Requiem's performance will better in its final release.</p>

And It's Looking Good" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qL0Gvnvoa3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Building the game with ray tracing in mind seems to be doing wonders for the experience as a whole, as Resident Evil Requiem looked stunning when I tried it last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Gamescom</a>. Although I wasn't able to experience combat, the short sequence set in Rhodes Hill Chronic Center made me very excited to see how the game will push the series forward when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

<p>"How beautiful, a divine quest so unobtainable..."</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital certainly has form when it comes to bringing us original indie games that go about things just a little bit differently than your usual fare, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, by developer Sam Eng, it seems the publisher's streak of off-kilter experiences looks set to continue. A good thing, we think you'll agree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, which is set to drop at some point a little later this year on Switch 2, sees you assume the role of a skateboarder, nothing unusual about that. However, this particular skateboarder, you see...well, he's sort of made out of glass, it says here. He's made a deal with the devil and he has to skate to the moon and then swallow it in order to be freed. Yep.</p>
<p>What this all means for us players, apparently, is some incredibly cool-looking skateboarding action as your trippy, glass skater-boi gets busy blasting around the Wastelands en route to the actual moon. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>You can check out the slick new trailer for the game above, and here's some more official details and some Switch 2 screens:</p>

<p>Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savour the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotic Beats for Demonic Streets</strong><br>
Cruise through The Underworld to a psychedelic soundtrack by enigmatic New York artist Blood Cultures, and additional tracks by John Fio.</p>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure</strong><br>
Skate through nine layers of The Underworld. Cruise through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps, and tortured demons. Push your way through precarious paths and shred freeform skate spots. Discover and create your own challenges as you explore the world and master your board.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb To The Beauty of The Board</strong><br>
Sell your soul for decks, wheels, and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up, learn new tricks, and get new gear. Destroy vicious demons with your 360 flip… or at least impress them.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It's all very stylish, the soundtrack seems awesome from what we glean from the short trailer, and there does seem to be an emphasis on actual skilful skating stuff, which has got our inner Tony Hawks very, very intrigued.</p>

            <p>
I confess, after reading the comments on yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">Endless Legend 2 early access impressions</a>, I am mortally afeared that I'm one of those accursed "positive outliers" I keep reading about in the Gamer Witchfinder Almanac. Seemingly, a fair portion of you were turned off by the recent Steam demo. You may be interested, then, to read specifics about how Amplitude have changed the game in response to demo feedback.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3407390/view/496081198026588764?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, here's what they think you liked. Firstly, the Tidefall mechanic, whereby the ocean retreats periodically to reveal extra playable terrain, and the regular Monsoons that sweep the land. "This was a core element of the game, and we were happy to see it having a real impact," the devs write, adding that they tinkered a lot with the quantity of Monsoons and Tidefalls. Apparently, there were once eight smaller Tidefalls to every game of Endless Legend 2, so many that players began ignoring them.
</p>
<p>
They also reckon you're keen on the asymmetrical faction design - "always a focus of Amplitude" - and that you're mostly enjoying the art and sound, including the map design, characters and jingles for stuff like minor factions, or the weird echoey thudding you might hear during Monsoons.
</p>
<p>
Now for weaknesses. According to Amplitude, the bulk of the negative feedback concerned the user interface. "A quarter of reviews mentioned UI and only 30% of those comments were positive," they note. "In reading all your feedback we realize it's not as simple as making a few changes and we are looking at something larger. There are instances where we displayed the wrong or not enough information. There were UI and text bugs to fix and we think more is needed here, which will take some time."
</p><p>
In particular, they're looking at making the city screens more intelligible. "Adjacency, leveling districts, managing population, and having clear decisions on what to build next were all muddy," the devs write. This is a "flow issue", apparently, which I guess refers to how your eyeballs and attention move from one UI element to the next in the course of urban management.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, they might change up Districts so that you can select them from a construction list like Improvements, rather than picking a tile to build on first. "This will take time to change and won't be in the initial Early Access, but we will be sharing concepts with you to get feedback," the devs comment.
</p>
<p>
To belatedly update my impressions from yesterday, I haven't had much of a problem with the UI in the early access build, but there were definitely a couple of moments this week when the verdant tile designs made it hard to discern, say, city centres, or units inside cities. It's definitely rather busy, which is to be expected for a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game with such florid factions and a turbulent expanding map. I also sometimes forgot what right-click and left-click do in different contexts. I don't consider any of these deal-breakers, however.
</p>
<p>
Following on from those UI thoughts, Amplitude acknowledge that some players have found the colourful world a little too hallucinogenic. They've addressed this in early access by making city foundations clearer, so you know to build there, while getting rid of bugs (not the Necrophage) that caused blurriness, and adding more graphics options.  They've also reduced the colour saturation of the terrain a little and made the all-important hexagonal grid lines more prominent, while shrinking certain fancier vegetation that players kept confusing with Anomalies. 
</p><p>
"It's a difficult balance between providing a lush, detailed world where you can see the leaves blow in the wind during monsoon, and still not have to strain or be confused when trying to see information you need to play," the developers observe.
</p>
<p>
In my impressions of Endless Legend 2, I was most critical of the character writing. Demo players were also iffy about this side of the game. In their Steam post, Amplitude note that there are many more words in Endless Legend 2 than the 2014 original, including reams of character dialogue. "We want heroes to feel personal and deep," they write. "They may be members of your council, have their own friends and enemies, and they talk directly to you and each other. But this additional granularity also came with issues. 
</p>
<p>
"For Early Access we have updated the presentation of the dialog, we are cutting lines and events to focus on only the best and most suitable," the devs continue. "In some cases, the wrong character would say something, or a character it didn't make sense for, which we are fixing." I definitely picked up on a few instances of the latter, but my overarching problem with the character writing is that the focus on characters doesn't do certain factions justice. The Necrophage are a horde, not a cast. The Aspect are a reef, not an ensemble. That's what I find attractive about them conceptually, at least.
</p>
<p>
Endless Legend 2 launches into early access on 22nd September. It'll start off with five factions. They're planning to add a sixth plus multiplayer and custom faction support before the 1.0 release next year. If you end up disliking it please don't burn my house down.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was late to the party in discovering what a treat the new Sony-animated, Netflix-owned hit movie&nbsp;<em>K-Pop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>is. The story and characters are fun, but we all know the real show is the soundtrack. Just banger after banger. You should be listening to “Golden” and “Your Idol” on loop and you deserve to do that on a good speaker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Anker has its Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker on sale right now over at Amazon. Normally priced at $45, you can get one for as low as $29.</a> That 35% discount saves you a solid $16.</p>
<p>That cheaper price is for the black model. If you’re willing to pay a wee bit more (but still less than the list price) you can grab the Anker Soundcore 2 speaker in one of three funky colors. It’s available in red, blue, and navy. Each of those is discounted down from $46 to $38. That $9 difference between these and the black version might be worth it if you want some extra style in your life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What we have here is a fine portable speaker with big sound in a compact form. At only about 6.5 inches long, The Anker Soundcore 2 can easily slip into a bag or be carried around with your wherever you go. It utilizes Bluetooth 5.0 which can ensure you always maintain a stable connection between your phone, laptop, or other audio source and the speaker., even at a distance.</p>
<p>The speaker has a powerful battery with 5,200mAh, capable of delivering you great sound all day long. That Li-ion battery will last you a full 24 hours on a single charge.</p>



<h2>Rugged for the Outdoors</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to take this Bluetooth speaker outside. The Anker Soundcore 2 is IPX7 waterproof so it can handle getting splashed on poolside under rained over. It can even be fully submerged underwater and come out just fine. Heck, take this in the shower with you and sing along.</p>
<p>If you decide to double dip and get yourself a second Anker Soundcore 2 speaker, you can wireless pair them together. This will enable a bold stereo sound for even more immersive listening at double the volume. You can even choose to just have them both output the same thing if you want to keep them in different rooms of your house during a party. This way as people navigate from the living room the to kitchen, they never need to leave the music behind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Right now, you can get this Anker Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker for as low as just $29.</a></p>
