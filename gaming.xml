            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-samsung-lawsuit-mobile-blocker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic is suing Google and Samsung over a mechanism built into the latter's mobile devices constitutes what it calls "anti-competitive and unfair conduct".</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-suing-google-and-samsung-over-auto-blockers-barrier-to-other-app-stores" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a> (which cites Epic's legal filing with the Northern District of California), Epic wants the courts to prevent Samsung enabling by default a feature called Auto Blocker on its phones and tablets.</p>
<p>In essence, this feature automatically prevents the installation of any app that isn't from the Google Play Store or Samsung's own App Store on Samsung mobile devices, and given Epic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-defeats-google-in-jury-trial-over-app-store-monopoly-case">fury</a> regarding Apple and Google's so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store">mobile duopoly</a>, you can probably guess how the company feels about that feature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-suing-google-samsung-fortnite.jpg?itok=uubrAsFY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-suing-google-samsung-fortnite.jpg?itok=W4eHDV9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s Epic Games is suing Google and Samsung.</figcaption></figure><p>According to GI.biz, Samsung originally introduced the Auto Blocker feature to its devices in October last year, but the company began switching on the feature as default in July this year.</p>
<p>Epic says that in order to bypass Auto Blocker and download its mobile store on Android devices, Samsung users must embark on "an exceptionally onerous 21-step process", since the Auto Blocker describes Epic's mobile store as coming from an "unknown" source.</p>
<p>The gaming giant's argument is that Samsung's description of its apps as coming from "unknown" places harms its reputation and leads to "identifiable instances of users abandoning the installation of Epic apps".</p>
<p>Furthermore, Epic argues that Samsung and Google (the latter of which owns the Android operating system) being in partnership is in contravention of an antitrust ruling in December, wherein a judge found Google did indeed have what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">The Verge calls an "illegal monopoly"</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-phone-epic-games.jpg?itok=tS01cop9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-phone-epic-games.jpg?itok=WLTwZg9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Samsung's phones come with a feature Epic does not like.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, Epic has a storied history when it comes to challenging Google and Apple on letting users install apps from sources other than the Play Store or the App Store.</p>
<p>The company's fight with the two mobile giants goes back to 2020, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms">sale on <em>Fortnite</em>'s V-Bucks</a>, which Epic attempted to use its own direct payment system to facilitate,&nbsp;prompted both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store">Google</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines">Apple</a> to remove the game from their stores.</p>
<p>Since then, Epic has been embroiled in protracted battles with both app store makers, although December's antitrust ruling, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-to-reinstate-epic-games-ios-developer-account-paving-way-for-fortnites-return-to">reinstatement</a> of Epic's Apple developer account back in March and the subsequent reappearance of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on that platform, bode well for the studio.</p>
<p>Whether or not Epic wins this battle against Samsung and Google remains to be seen, but it's not likely that the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer will back down. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

The performance improvements and latency reductions arrive around a month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">disappointing Zen 5 desktop CPU reviews</a> and appear alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230321/microsoft-windows-11-update-ryzen-cpu-performance-improvement">updates to Windows 11</a> that include optimized AMD-specific branch prediction for both Zen 4 and Zen 5 chips.</p><p>CPU reviewers have been reporting a higher-than-expected core-to-core latency across the Ryzen 9000-series of desktop processors, and now AMD has addressed this with a new BIOS optimization.</p><p>The latest AMD updates for AM5 motherboards include AGESA PI 1.2.0.2 firmware, which <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/bg-p/gaming-blogs">AMD says</a> will address some “corner cases” where it takes two transactions to read and write when information is shared across different parts of a Ryzen 9 9000 processor. “We’ve managed to cut the number of transactions in half for this use case, which helps reduce core-to-core latency in multi-CCD models,” says AMD.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD is promising a 10 percent uplift on the 9700X with its new 105-watt mode.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>This BIOS update also includes a new 105-watt cTDP option to push the thermal design power of the Ryzen 9600X and 9700X. “These processors have been validated at 105W since their release, so you won’t be pushing them beyond their design limits,” says AMD. “This boost is especially beneficial for multithreaded workloads, but you might see some gains in less-threaded apps too.”</p><p>You’ll need to make sure you have appropriate cooling to enable the 105-watt mode, but AMD says it should result in around 10 percent more performance on the Ryzen 9600X and 9700X. This new mode won’t void your warranty, either.</p><p>AMD is also launching its next round of AM5 motherboards this week, with the X870 and X870E boards both available at retailers. You don’t need these new boards for AMD’s latest Ryzen 9000-series CPUs, but they do come with USB 4.0 as standard, and they also include PCIe 5 Gen 5 on the graphics and NVMe sides that can be used simultaneously. There are rumors that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255234/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-specs-leak">upcoming RTX 5090</a> will be a PCIe Gen 5 card, and AMD teases it’s “more important than ever now that we are on the cusp of a new generation of graphics cards” to have full PCIe Gen 5 support.</p><p>The X870 and X870E boards also include support for higher-clocked memory. AMD has now enabled DDR5-8000 EXPO support on these new boards, which includes around 1 to 2ns of latency improvements over DDR5-6000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becrowned">Becrowned</a>. In fact, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2266890/BECROWNED/">game’s demo</a> managed to make me go “oooh” than “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.</p>

<p>What a beaut, eh? There’s something about capturing the actual ambition of PSX-era visuals, and not just wallowing in its limitations for grunginess, that I find really endearing. There’s still a fair amount of grunginess, granted, but with some added creative flair that makes Becrowned’s setting feel like its own place, despite obviously evoking some genre classics. Also, I’m glad to see the Silent Hill 2 tradition of having you play as a premiere wanker haunted by his own wankery adopted whole cloth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Torrance is a man who will do anything to get what he wants. Не is a man of strong will and unbreakable character. He is rational and cold-blooded. Richard strives to shape the world to his liking. Despite his efforts, he has never achieved what he truly desires - happiness. What led him to a world of endless suffering? Uncover the mysteries of the protagonist's past to find out.</p></blockquote>

<p>I actually did restart and choose tank controls in the end. After the elevator shenanigans, I shuffled along a long corridor, found a knife on a corpse, then banged on a door until the person behind it got annoyed enough to send a scythe-limbed ghoul at me. Combat is incredibly awkward, and your dude swings the knife like a ping pong paddle. In other words, it’s everything I want from melee combat in a survival horror game with fixed camera angles and tank controls.</p>
<p>I won’t go into too much detail about the discoveries you’ll soon make, except to say that I get the feeling ol' Dicky Torrance has done some very bad things. I'm very much into the art and atmosphere here, and while we’re circling around the periphery of old school survival horror revival fatigue, Becrowned has enough going for it to be worth a look. Again, make sure you go with tank controls, unless you want to fully embrace the latent self-flagellation I’m sure is lurking somewhere close to the surface of the protagonist’s psyche.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During the early '90s, Ken Kutaragi and Sony attempted to collaborate with Nintendo on an early version of PlayStation, which was intended as a CD drive for the SNES. When that partnership faltered, Kutaragi and Sony moved forward with the original PlayStation in 1994. Although that system ultimately changed the entire video game industry, Kutaragi still recalls the doubters both inside and outside of Sony 25 years later.</p><p>"We wanted to share the passion," said Kuturagi at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5799/" data-ref-id="2900-5799">Tokyo Games Show</a> via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ken-kutaragi-claims-everyone-at-sony-thought-the-playstation-would-fail/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "We wanted to hear their expectations and what they did not expect, so we wanted to hear from them. So we visited dozens of companies if not hundreds, we visited a lot of game makers. It was a great memory. They were not interested. They just said, 'Don't do it. There were multiple companies and none of them were successful. You are going to fail.' That's what they told us."</p><p>It's understandable why not everyone shared Kuturagi's passion for the project. When PlayStation entered the market, Nintendo and Sega were the only two dominant console-makers. Sony may have had more powerful hardware than the Genesis, the SNES, or the 32X peripheral, but Sega's Saturn was launching at right around the same time. And if that system had caught on like Sony's PS, then the console wars may have turned out very differently.</p><p>Microsoft had a similar experience in 2001 when it had to follow Sega's Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 into the market. Sega soon exited the console scene, leaving Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft as the major players in the industry. Through four successive console generations, Sony remains one of the most dominant companies in video games. And it all started because Kutaragi and his team had a vision for the future of gaming.</p>

(Apologies, Adam West fans, but 1966's <em>Batman: The Movie </em>isn’t here. We won’t complain if it remains #1 in your own personal ranking, though.) As you read through this list, you’ll notice that some Batman movies have a huge quality gap. For example, it’s tough to pit the controversial 2017 <em>Justice League</em>—which was ultimately outshone by Zack Snyder’s four-hour director’s cut—against Christopher Nolan’s highly regarded <em>The Dark Knight Trilogy</em>. In other cases, Batman has nipples on his suit, but I tried not to let that influence my rankings.<br></p></div><div><p>I told you Batman’s nipple suit wouldn’t sway me! Though, I have to recognize that George Clooney wears it with considerable poise in this 1997 film, which otherwise suffers from a serious lack of substance. In his ultimately futile effort to find a cure for his cryogenically frozen wife’s incurable illness, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) plans to freeze all of Gotham (“and then…the world!”). But Mr. Freeze quickly learns that you can’t fight ice with ice — Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) has her own agenda, and she defrosts Freeze’s wife and leaves her to die. </p><p>One-liners and one-dimensional character building ensue as Batman, Robin (Christopher O’Donnell) and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl try to save the world with their latex out. But, though <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> is widely thought of as <em>the</em> worst Batman movie in existence, it’s not completely without merit. It offers a very ‘90s take on the ‘60s <em>Batman</em> TV show’s holy, campy excess. For example: when I first watched <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> as a middle schooler, I kept replaying the scene where Uma Thurman performs a sultry striptease out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0txnukioagY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0txnukioagY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gorilla costume</a></span>, and I wondered if I was bisexual or if I just liked the part where she’s a gorilla.<br></p></div><div><p>Oh, Ben Affleck Batman, if only you spoke in a normal vocal register for 2016's <em>Batman v. Superman</em>, maybe then J. Lo wouldn’t have divorced you. Or maybe not—Batman’s lawnmower voice isn’t the only issue with this Zack Snyder movie, which struggles for air under the constraints of its convoluted plot. </p><p>At first you’d think that <em>Batman v. Superman</em> would be a movie that explores the complexities of justice; Batman doesn’t like how Superman does things, and vice versa. That’s a natural assumption for a movie called <em>Batman v. Superman</em>, but then you realize that no one in it knows why they want what they do—and Batman would like to build a kryptonite grenade launcher. The movie’s showstopper fight is with the colossal Gila monster Doomsday and, though he is fearsome, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman looks like she’s sleeping with her eyes open when she helps Batman and Superman take him on. It’s all over-the-top, and overly complicated. In all the excess, <em>Batman v. Superman</em> forgets to build out its characters, or pay accurate tribute to the grim Frank Miller comics it’s inspired by.<br></p></div><div><p><em>The Flash</em> was doomed from the start. Ezra Miller was first announced to star in the movie — which was ultimately released in 2023—back in 2014. From there, <em>The Flash</em> got passed around by writers and directors for nearly a decade before being delayed again by the covid pandemic. Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/ezra-miller-the-flash-timeline-arrests-controversies-abuse-1234765089/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/ezra-miller-the-flash-timeline-arrests-controversies-abuse-1234765089/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginning in 2020</a></span>, Miller became embroiled in a series of grave controversies, eventually leading them to release a statement <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2022/film/news/ezra-miller-apologizes-the-flash-mental-health-issues-1235341888/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/ezra-miller-apologizes-the-flash-mental-health-issues-1235341888/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2022</a></span>, which cites “complex mental health issues.” For all the pain and confusion it’s associated with, <em>The Flash </em>is regrettably mediocre. Bad acting and special effects abound in what might have never been meant to exist in the first place.<br></p></div><div><p>The biggest problem with <em>Batman: The Killing Joke </em>is that it’s unmemorable. The same cannot be said about Alan Moore’s 1988 graphic novel of the same name, which chilled me so viciously as a teen, I started reading Nietzsche.<br></p><p>Its plot, which is recreated in the second half of the 2016 animated movie, provides a popular origin story for the Joker: a failed comedian falls into an acid pit, which burns him into the white-faced Joker. In the present, Joker paralyzes Barbara Gordon by shooting her through the stomach, then he kidnaps her father, Commissioner Gordon, torturing and goading him into going insane.<br></p><p>But the first half of the 2016 movie is dedicated to what ultimately feels like an auxiliary story about Barbara, as Batgirl, being horny and violent, subject to her overwhelming emotions as a woman. Then, even with Mark Hamill’s legendary voice acting, the more faithful second half of the movie can’t capture the insidiousness that artist Brian Bolland manages to transmit with the stationary comic book page.<br></p></div><div><p>I know that Zack Snyder’s self-congratulatory, four-hour director’s cut of his 2017 <em>Justice League</em> has become a fan-favorite, but let’s acknowledge the tragedy of the original theatrical cut. Ben Affleck’s lawnmower Batman voice is back, as is Gal Gadot’s medicine acting, and Ezra Miller’s agitated Barry Allen. After raising Superman (Henry Cavill) from the dead by dousing him in amniotic fluid, the heroes try to take on the alien military general Steppenwolf with special effects excess. Its stakes feel low, and its premise unexciting.</p></div><div><p>Not only did 2004's <em>Catwoman</em> earn Oscar-winner Halle Berry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-7s_yeQuDg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-7s_yeQuDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Razzie</a></span> for Worst Actress, it also was named Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. All they forgot was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worst Game of Pickup Basketball</a></span>. But, there are plenty of diamonds to find if you sift through <em>Catwoman</em>’s stiff dialogue, gloopy CGI, and contrived story (Catwoman works to uncover a murder plot at a cosmetics company—you know, woman stuff). In recent years especially, <em>Catwoman</em> has been reclaimed as a slutty <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/halleberry/status/1452831358951243777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/halleberry/status/1452831358951243777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cult classic</a></span>. When you watch it through this lens, you’ll see that it’s full of perfect outfits and throwaway lines, like when, amid the thrum of <em>Catwoman</em>’s near-constant, flirty R&amp;B, Catwoman orders “a White Russian, no ice. Hold the vodka, hold the Kahlúa.”</p><p>The bartender slides it over: “Cream, straight up,” </p></div><div><p><em>Joker</em> is complicated. Joaquin Phoenix (who famously lost 52 pounds to play the sallow, unsuccessful comedian Arthur Fleck) is convincing in Todd Phillips’ 2019 movie; as he’s constantly beaten and ridiculed throughout <em>Joker</em>, Phoenix takes on the ineffable fragility of a picked flower. Though the movie operates in exhausting black-and-white thinking, you still wish for Arthur’s preservation…until he starts killing everyone. Then, <em>Joker</em> becomes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/joker-starring-joaquin-phoenix-sparked-incel-controversy-because-it-s-ncna1062656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/joker-starring-joaquin-phoenix-sparked-incel-controversy-because-it-s-ncna1062656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an acrid power fantasy</a></span>, eliminating all of Arthur’s softness with a flamethrower. It does, at least, make an interesting argument for nihilism, and its impact <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://img.ifunny.co/images/0010f87f8f296ec4c41fd9fc782b231e41c2c8705878d22bb7319af69d7994fc_1.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://img.ifunny.co/images/0010f87f8f296ec4c41fd9fc782b231e41c2c8705878d22bb7319af69d7994fc_1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on culture</a></span> has been significant, but it’s not as clever as it presents.<br></p></div><div><p>2020's <em>Birds of Prey</em> is everything <em>Joker </em>is not: tender, approachable, and cute—cloyingly so, at times. An affable Margot Robbie reprises her role as Harley Quinn, who just got dumped. She goes through stages of grief, chopping off her pigtails and adopting a hyena, until the whole world starts wanting her dead. With help from characters like Black Canary (Jurnee Smollet) and The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Harley Quinn takes on some bad boys and protects young Cassandra Cain (an effervescent Ella Jay Basco) from harm after she steals a precious diamond. In the process, she rediscovers who she is without a green-haired madman holding her hand. Like its antihero protagonist, <em>Birds of Prey</em> won’t save the world, but it is a lot of bubbly fun. </p></div><div><p>Joel Schumacher’s 1995 <em>Batman Forever</em> might be unpopular, but hear me out. Does the movie’s cheesy theatricality often get it criticized for being a giant <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7XO3fzTBtI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7XO3fzTBtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batman Forever toy ad</a></span>? Yes, but it’s a very good ad. </p><p>Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones doing his best ham imitation) and the Riddler (an electric Jim Carrey) team up to torture Batman, taking his love interest (Nicole Kidman) and partner Robin (Chris O’Donnell) hostage. Batman triumphs, in the end, by combatting the Riddler with a bad riddle of his own—”I see without seeing…to me, darkness is as clear as daylight,” Val Kilmer says with gravel in his mouth.<br></p><p>Then, there are many impressive sounds of agony, and the Riddler’s brain gets sucked dry by ‘90s CGI. None of it is innovative or smart, but it is pleasant to watch with your mind powered off. And <em>Batman Forever</em> has one of the series’ most exciting romances, too. I’ve always wanted to see Nicole Kidman make kissing a guy in a polyurethane rubber mask look glamorous.<br></p></div><div><p>In its strong cast and (mostly) focused plot, <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> shares merits with the rest of Christopher Nolan’s revered <em>Dark Knight </em>trilogy. Christian Bale is as tortured as ever, and Tom Hardy, hissing through the claws of his facemask, continues to be an imposing and calculated villain. The 2012 movie is a solid end to Nolan’s series, and it excels in its anxiety-inducing scenes of Bane and other villains forcing their way into political power. But it fumbles near the finish line, where it tries to introduce an underwhelming plot twist. It doesn’t feel necessary — <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is at its best when it’s being intuitive.<br></p></div><div><p>The best part of Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em> is what it did for the franchise. In 1989, audiences were accustomed to the spiky POW! graphics and tiny underwear associated with the 1960s Batman TV series. It had (and still has) merit as an accurate representation of Batman’s Silver Age comics, and as proof that billionaire orphandom doesn’t need to make a guy any less charming.<br></p><p>But Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em> destroys that feel-good image in compelling ways. What it lacks in fascinating plot (the lovely journalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) is kidnapped by Jack Nicholson’s frighteningly lucid Joker, and smitten Michael Keaton has to save her), it makes up for in psychology. It creeps into you. Everything is gray, bleak, foggy—except for the Joker’s catlike smile, which stretches into a red wound.<br></p><p>“Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?” Joker asks a young Bruce Wayne after killing his parents.<br></p><p>That single line alone has attracted decades of fan analysis and discussion. And, single-handedly, <em>Batman</em> has made it captivatingly impossible for its hero to ever recover his Adam West sparkle.<br></p></div><div><p>In 2005, Nolan started his Batman trilogy with <em>Batman Begins</em>, delivering Bruce Wayne deeper into the dark Tim Burton conjured in the ‘90s. In Nolan’s hands, Batman is an even more serious creature, unlikely to ever tolerate the fact that the 1989 Joker wears a purple hat. Instead, he trains from childhood to become a weapon, though he ultimately rejects a recruitment opportunity from the League of Shadows when joining would require him to kill.<br></p><p>So <em>Batman Begins</em> is as much about Batman’s creation as it is about his conflicted morality, heightening encounters with Scarecrow (a genuinely frightening Cillian Murphy) and Ra’s al Ghul (Liam Neeson), who come with their own visions of paradise. Moral gray is the bulk of what makes <em>Batman Begins</em> interesting, though, for all its characters’ frowning, it does have some classic superhero fun—Liam Neeson, for example, plans to microwave Gotham’s water supply.<br></p></div><div><p>I don’t know if any crystal ball could have predicted that <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> would become one of the most beloved Batman movies in history, but here we are.<br></p><p>The 2017 cartoon is a loving ode to Batman lore that’s all-ages funny, with charismatic voice acting and vibrant animation. Its screwball plot starts with Batman offending the Joker—who wants to be a meaningful part of Batman’s life—and ends with Batman acknowledging his intimacy issues. So, while it provides plenty of sloshing buckets of fun, <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> is also full of warm and fuzzy tenderness. You’ll want to return to it with butter popcorn and a comfortable blanket in hand.<br></p></div><div><p>OK, let’s shift gears significantly from <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> and talk about 2022's <em>The Batman</em>.<br></p><p>At its core, <em>The Batman</em> is a detective movie. That’s good news, considering Batman is meant to be the “World’s Greatest Detective.” After the Riddler (an insidious Paul Dano) murders the mayor on Halloween, Batman (moody Robert Pattinson) investigates the crime with police Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). In downcast glances and trails of blood, Batman handles bombs and the mounting air of desolation that falls on Gotham. But, even in the pall, he finds hope.<br></p><p>Batman’s emotional journey here is captivating, and the villainy he’s up against is remarkably believable for a superhero caper. It’s easy to feel <em>The Batman</em>’s tension floating into your body. And <em>The Batman</em> is original. There are hardly any other Batman movies as devoted to noir as this one.<br></p></div><div><p>The 1993 animated film <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> communicates what made <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> so iconic. Like the TV series that spawned it, whose reruns defined my teenage years, <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> treats animation like a serious medium for serious material—it doesn’t hesitate to show you Batman as both a romantic and broken man.<br></p><p>The movie, which features Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill’s perfect voice acting for Batman and the Joker, also loosely references Frank Miller’s <em>Batman: Year One</em> and Mike W. Barr’s <em>Year Two</em> comics. In it, Batman faces murder accusations and the reality that his ex-fiancée is a lying Grim Reaper, who might still love him. It’s all as emotionally complex and volatile as you’d think, making endless rewatches a necessity.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s hard to imagine another Batman movie dethroning <em>The Dark Knight</em>’s influence on culture. Nolan’s 2008 movie is thrilling and painful; the Joker (Heath Ledger) terrorizes Batman’s love interest Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and <em>her</em> love interest, the district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and then anyone else he can set on fire. As Alfred (Michael Caine) famously says in one scene, “some men just want to watch the world burn.”</p><p>And that’s what makes <em>The Dark Knight</em> incredible, how much Heath Ledger sells that idea. We’re almost two decades removed from his performance, and still no other Joker has been able to replicate the effortless depravity Ledger found in caked face paint and nervous energy. </p></div><div><p>I think I’ve seen Tim Burton’s 1992 <em>Batman Returns</em> more than the palm of my hand. It’s my favorite Christmas movie.<br></p><p>The Penguin (Danny DeVito, being perfectly strange) and Catwoman (an irresistible Michelle Pfeiffer, being perfectly strange) frame Batman for murder while the rest of Gotham tries to enjoy their festive Christmas tree lighting. But the Penguin—Oswald Cobblepot, abandoned as a deformed child and now rejected by society for his violence—still has further to fall. Catwoman, too, digs into vengefulness with her long razor nails.<br></p><p>Both characters serve as an interesting argument that humanity is a choice; both ultimately push down forgiveness and empathy in order to sink into their animal personas. Michael Keaton’s Batman isn’t immune to the dark call of the beady bat, either—he eventually uses a swarm of them to completely incapacitate the Penguin. So <em>Batman Returns </em>doesn’t bother with the tunnel vision morality of some lesser superhero movies. It exhumes the beast inside all these self-aggrandizing people in their disguises, and it does it with stunning clarity and magnetism. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-ui-update-home-screen-ads/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Players have spotted ads and news feed items they cannot turn off in PS5’s new UI update.</p>



<p>The PS5 recently dropped a UI update with a new personalized space called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-latest-system-update-introduces-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Welcome Hub</a>. This update allowed players to add customizable widgets and backgrounds to the console’s home screen. One of the features was supposed to let players remove all ads and news feed widgets from their home screen, but it seems this feature isn’t working as intended.</p>



<p>Some <a href="https://x.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players have noticed</a> that after turning off the ads and news widgets in the latest PS5 UI update, they will still see ads, announcements, and newsfeed items related to the game or franchise in the background rather than a widget.</p>



<p>In the X post embedded below, players can see that games like Final Fantasy VII Remake display their ratings, Star Wars Battlefront II’s page highlights all other Star Wars games from EA, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s page features a <a href="https://x.com/ReptileHand/status/1840264340970111077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seven-month-old news feed article</a>, and so on.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So it turns out that the recent PS5 UI update that let you disable all the advertisements on the dashboard was too good to be true. Now EVERY SINGLE GAME on your homescreen shows you an advertisement in the background with no way to remove them lol <a href="https://t.co/Nts6eCq8Eb">https://t.co/Nts6eCq8Eb</a> <a href="https://t.co/29p56mYn34">pic.twitter.com/29p56mYn34</a></p>— Earl Turlet (@alfredobofa) <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredobofa/status/1840189326883262655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Many players wonder if the ads appearing in the PS5 UI update result from a bug or if they were introduced intentionally. The confusion stems from the fact that some of the information displayed on the screen may be irrelevant or outdated. Also, the issue wasn’t visible when the update was released, and players seem to have spotted it recently. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scalpers-already-ruining-the-ps5-pro-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scalpers have already ruined</a> the PS5 Pro launch.

I’m not sure how many people want that,” Schreier said, raising questions about Guerrilla’s strategy.</p><p>“They’ve got this [Horizon Zero Dawn] remaster coming and the Lego game [Lego Horizon Adventures] coming. What happens if neither of those hit, and it turns out there isn't a ton of interest in Horizon anymore? Are they still gonna be doing the online game? There are a lot of questions around their strategy and around that online game that I certainly have.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>Sony’s live service push has seen a hit in Arrowhead’s PC and PlayStation 5 co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, which is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, but Firewalk’s hero shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> flopped hard, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-game-director-steps-down-as-staff-at-sony-owned-firewalk-await-their-fate-report">becoming one of the most disastrous launches in PlayStation history</a>.</p><p>And at a time when the live service market is dominated by old games that continue to gobble up players’ attention and, crucially, their spend, newcomers are finding it increasingly difficult to carve out a piece of the action. Before Concord’s release and subsequent shut down, the most high-profile live service casualty was Rocksteady’s much-maligned <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>, which flopped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report"><u>to the tune of $200 million</u></a> for publisher Warner Bros.</p><p>Sony itself has scaled back its live service ambitions dramatically following big investment. In November last year, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works</u></a>, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025. The following month, in December 2023, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>Naughty Dog announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</u></a>, its troubled attempt to create a live service version of its hugely popular franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>LEGO Horizon Adventures First Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Then, in February this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>Sony announced a significant round of layoffs</u></a> affecting around 900 staff at its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs hit a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Firesprite, and, most significantly, PlayStation's London studio, which closed down. Alongside the layoffs, a number of in-development games were canceled. In July, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>Sony-owned Bungie</u></a>, maker of the Destiny series, suffered devastating cuts, with its PvP-focused extraction shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon"><u>Marathon</u></a> still in the works.</p><p>Despite the upheaval at Sony, Guerrilla Games continues to work on Horizon Online. In July, studio director Jan Bart van Beek said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-horizon-franchise-will-continue-for-a-very-long-while">the Horizon multiplayer game is "a massive shift for the studio, almost on the same level as doing the first Horizon.”</a></p><p>Van Beek added: "Building this all out to a multiplayer experience is a whole new challenge for the studio."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>PlayStation's live service initiative was no joke.</p></div><p>Guerrilla confirmed the existence of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-reportedly-in-the-works-alongside-a-multiplayer-game"><u>this long-rumored multiplayer game</u></a> in December 2022, revealing through a job listing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-multiplayer-game-confirmed-by-guerrilla"><u>it will feature a brand new cast of characters and a new art style.</u></a></p><p>A full-blown sequel to Horizon: Forbidden West is also in development at the studio, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-sequel-seemingly-on-the-way-as-guerrilla-confirms-aloys-next-adventure"><u>"Aloy's next adventure" was mentioned in April</u></a>. This will join the first two games alongside <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-call-of-the-mountain"><u>PlayStation VR2 spin-off Horizon: Call of the Mountain</u></a> as major video game entries in the franchise.</p><p>Don’t  hold your breath for Horizon 3, however. "And their plan... I mean, Horizon Online is their next project, not whatever the third single-player game looks like,” Schreier said. “So, that one might be a ways off.”</p><p>He continued: "PlayStation's live service initiative was no joke. Everybody was like… it's live service games all around. Horizon is one of the few ones that hasn't been canceled, or hasn't come out and flopped the way Concord did. So, a lot of questions there. But a lot of people are working on that online project.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Another day, another PSA: this time, it appears some stores have broken <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>'s street date, and retail copies of the seminal horror game are out in the wild.</p>
<p>Whilst some fans were already trying to avoid the clips and spoilers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-hours-long-streams-of-silent-hill-2-remake-and-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-are-popping-up-online">leaking out of officially-sanctioned hours-long streams</a>, images purportedly taken of the physical release - featuring a disc with "There was a hole here. It's gone now" emblazoned across it, and reversible cover art - are popping up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/">reddit</a>, as well as other social media sites.</p>

<p>Some of these posts have been accompanied by screenshots allegedly taken from the Remake that are not from any of the streams we've seen so far, nor are they images formally released by Konami.</p>
<p>Whilst it may seem a bit redundant to warn you about spoilers of a 20+-year-old game, don't forget that for many, this will be their first opportunity to play the horror for themselves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-will-take-more-than-20-hours-for-silent-hill-2-remake-completionists-to-find-everything-hidden-for-you">Bloober Team recently teased that the Remake's running time is double that of the original game</a>, and the official streams we've seen so far demonstrate that there's plenty of additional content and surprises... even for fans very familiar with the original game.</p>
<p>In other news, we now know Silent Hill 2 Remake will take up 50.5GB on PS5. Digital pre-orderers will be able to pre-load the game up to 48 hours ahead of release, so that's from midnight on 4th October for Deluxe Edition owners, and midnight on 6th October for the standard edition.</p> <div>

<p>A website unveiled to mark <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s anniversary last week has given us our best clue as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-arg-gives-us-our-best-clue-yet-as-to-what-game-were-getting-next">what unannounced Silent Hill game may be on the way</a>: either a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> Remake or even a direct Silent Hill 4 sequel.</p>
<p>At first, the Silent Hill Historical Society website looks little more than a bit of fan service thrown up to celebrate Silent Hill 2's 23rd anniversary and the upcoming release of Silent Hill 2 Remake. But fans have been poking around the site and using its clues to piece together a new mystery.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A fan has recreated HBO's trailer for the second season of its The Last of Us adaptation using video game footage from from Part 2.</p>
<p>Last week, as part of The Last of Us Day, HBO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> gave us our best look yet at season two, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">many scenes lifted directly from Part 2</a>. Now, we have closed the circle, and one fan has remade the TV trailer with game clips.</p>

</figure>
<p>This HBO-inspired trailer was shared on YouTube by Rage Tributes, and caught the attention of Naughty Dog's own Neil Druckmann. Linking to the trailer with a social media post over the weekend, Druckmann shared his appreciation with a simple but clearly impressed: "Wow!"</p>
<p>Rage Tributes' video, which was edited by Tommy Leeder, clearly switches a few characters about. For example, it is Ellie chatting at the start of the fan-made trailer, with Catherine O'Hara's therapist being an all-new character for the TV series.</p>
<p>But even with a few changes, this trailer further goes to show how faithful HBO is staying to its source material.</p>

            <p>It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stormgate">Stormgate</a> creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-iv">WarCraft 4</a>, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from Jason Schreier, him of the plentiful journalisms and assorted newsbrokage. He's got a book, Play Nice, about Blizzard's history out on 8th October. Seeking to recruit readers for his latest tome of investo-sleuthing, Schreier has descended to the fifth circle of Hell - Reddit - and done an Ask Me Anything. In it, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fs5nw9/comment/lpi304j/?utm_name=web3xcss">wrote the following</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/world-of-warcraft/desperate-to-get-another-rts-off-the-ground-blizzard-developers-reportedly-pitched-warcraft-4-and-a-call-of-duty-rts-that-got-shot-down/">Gamesradar</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Morten and his team tried for years to kick off a new RTS, making all sorts of pitches and prototypes, from Warcraft 4 to even, wildly, a Call of Duty RTS pitch. (He was desperate.) But there was no appetite among Blizzard's executive team for a new RTS game. They held out hope that if [Warcraft 3] Reforged was a massive success it might help open the doors for a WC4, but Reforged turned out to be a debacle -- the company's first bad game and a blemish in Blizzard's history.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you missed the Reforged debacle, the game shipped with a bunch of bugs, performance problems and missing features. Blizzard committed to patching the flaws initially, and then, as the player tirades continued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-now-offering-warcraft-3-reforged-refunds-to-anyone-who-wants-one">started offering refunds to anybody who asked</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">In her review of Reforged</a>, Alice B (RPS in peace) found it to be not quite as calamitous as all that, but definitely a disappointment. "People never entirely stopped playing the original Warcraft III, so when you think about it, a remastered version feels long overdue," she wrote in 2020. "In some respects, Warcraft III: Reforged does a serviceable job of fulfilling that need. In others, it's a bit - dare I say - underforged. In further respects still, some people might wish it had never happened."</p>
<p>You can see why Blizzard management might think twice about greenlighting anything arty-essy after all that, I guess. The departure of key staff is probably also a factor, with many ancient Star- and WarCraftspeople now gainfully employed elsewhere making spiritual sequels. Frost Giant and Stormgate aside, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battle-aces-is-a-fast-and-furious-mechabug-rts-from-blizzard-talent-that-turns-starcraft-into-a-game-of-cards">Battle Aces</a> from Uncapped Games, a studio founded by former StarCraft 2 lead multiplayer designer David Kim. Meanwhile, Blizzard continue to butt their heads against the much-aborted daydream of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">a StarCraft shooter</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure there's any need for one, but I wouldn't mind playing a Call Of Duty RTS. Predictably, I'm thinking a smaller infantry tactics affair would make more sense than a game of mass production and bases, though I do like the idea of spawning two dozen Soap MacTavishes and hearing their voice lines overlap. I can't quite see new parent company Microsoft signing off on such a thing, in these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">times of mass layoffs</a>, but if there's one thing Microsoft appear 100% committed to it's the onward march of Call Of Duty. Who knows?</p>
<p>While you foment the ole speculation, why not revisit this prototype for a COD RTS created by Vicarious Visions over 12 long years ago.</p>

            <p>
Epic has today announced major new litigation as it takes its battle against existing app store monopolies to former ally Samsung, as well as continued rival Google, in a fresh front that may see a return to the courtroom.
</p>
<p>
One key feature found on Samsung phones forms the cornerstone of Epic Games' new complaint: a setting known as Auto Blocker that users must turn off to install Epic Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The instigator of this complaint is one and only one thing: that Samsung recently introduced a piece of technology it calls Auto Blocker, which blocks side-loading of software - it blocks the installation of software from stores that aren't its own, or the Google Play store," Epic boss Tim Sweeney said in a press briefing ahead of the litigation being made public.
</p>
<p>
Epic suggests Auto Blocker is an attempt at collusion between Google and Samsung, where the former hands off what Epic deems to be anti-competitive practices to a major partner, ahead of firmer rules being enforced on Google itself.
</p>
<p>
In practice, Auto Blocker works similarly to the existing "scare screens" and additional technical steps on other phones that make downloading software outside of official sources - such as the Google Play and iPhone App Store -  more difficult.
</p>
<p>
Users attempting to download the Epic Game Store, for example, are warned in technical and scary language that they are risking the safety of their device, and required to go disable  Auto Blocker from within their phone's settings via a fairly laborious process to continue. 
</p>
<p>
Already, Android's sequence of alerts and extra steps dissuades around 50 percent of users from going on to complete the download, Sweeney said. Samsung's Auto Blocker steps add further "friction" on top of that, he continued.
</p>
<p>
"For your security, your phone currently isn't allowed to install unknown apps from this source," one alert message reads. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, Google knows what Fortnite is, they've distributed it in the past," Sweeney noted. "Google knows what Epic Game Store is, they've dealt with us. So this warning in itself is misleading."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_udQUCb4.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Epic Games slideshow showing steps to install on Samsung devices, including switching off Auto Blocker. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Epic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Epic is unhappy with both Google and Samsung here, as users must allow Google's Chrome browser to install software (such as the Epic Game Store) and then deal with Samsung's Auto Blocker itself. 
</p>
<p>
"[This is] a new Samsung warning that came in after we won Epic vs. Google," Sweeney said. "A feature Samsung turned on by default for all [new] users which caught us off-guard." 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney described Samsung's own alerts during the installation process also as "misleading", as once again the generic warning message describes Epic Game Store as an "unknown app".
</p>
<p>
"Samsung knows what Fortnite is," he continued. "Fortnite has been presented in numerous of their stage presentations and streams to the public, they've been marketing it in a partnership where we've spent tens of millions of dollars together. Samsung knows Epic Game Store. And yet they're calling it an 'unknown app'."
</p>
<p>
Samsung describes Auto Blocker as a feature that helps "keep ypu safe from security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks" and also works to block malware in messaging apps, and warns you when unknown commands or software updates are initiated by devices connected via USB. In short, turning it off is made to sound like a bad move.
</p>
<p>
"It makes it pretty much hopeless for any store to ever compete with  the Samsung Galaxy Store and Google Play store," Sweeney said. "It's intentional. The purpose of this is not to protect the user from malware. Windows and Mac have perfectly good mechanisms to protect against malware, and Epic completely supports platforms protecting against malware. 
</p>
<p>
"What's happening here is different: it's just trying to obstruct against competition by making it super hard, and one of the key elements of this obstruction is presenting misleading messages to the user which present software as - which the platform maker know about, knows is safe and secure - [and is instead] characterising it as unknown and potentially harmful to your device. That's what our litigation is about.
</p>
<p>
"It's about unfair competition by making it seem like competitor's products inferior to the company's products themselves."
</p>
<p>
And this, of course, is a huge problem for Epic Games as it chases ambitious smartphone install targets for its storefront and Fortnite. Sweeney revealed that Epic Game Store had now hit 10m mobile installs, but the company is still chasing a much higher 100m target by the year's end. 
</p>
<p>
Epic says it is launching the legal action now following the recent move by Samsung to have Auto Blocker switched on by default for new handsets. 
</p>
<p>In a statement, Epic said its lawsuit claims the "recent implementation of the Auto Blocker feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the US District Court's remedy following the jury's verdict in Epic's case against Google". </p>
<p>"The jury found that Google's app store practices are illegal, including the unlawful agreements Google enters into with phone manufacturers such as Samsung."</p>
<p>Epic says its aim with these legal proceedings is to get Auto Blocker turned off by default to "enable competition". </p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Samsung and Google for comment.
</p>
<p>The Epic Game Store recently launched on Android devices and on iPhone and iPad in the European Union, offering a way to play Fortnite once again - following Epic's previous legal drama with Google and Android, which it has always portrayed as a fight against their platform store monopolies.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">We've probably lost $1bn dollars... but what's the price of freedom</a>?" Sweeney previously said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>KT Racing has released the first major patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>, aiming to fix the vast majority of the issues that affected the game’s launch earlier this month.</p>
<p>The update is available for download across all platforms, as of 8AM UTC today, 30th September. Alongside this, the servers are also undergoing maintenance, which started at the same time.</p>


<p>The key improvements are to do with stability, KT Racing hoping to fix the vast majority of the server errors, lobby and race disconnections and other issues affecting the online-only game. They’ve also sought for general improvements to the frame rate, while keeping the same graphics quality, and then there’s over 300 other miscellaneous fixes as well.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown:</p>
<h3>Servers/Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significant server/network improvements: fixed login errors, lobbies and races disconnections, save issues &amp; other specific server-related problems.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where meeting points and POI discovery were not saved</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performances/Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stability improvements (fixed various crashes and freezes)</li>
<li>Performances improvements (increased global framerate while maintaining the same graphics quality)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphics/Interfaces(UX/UI)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Master setting in graphical options</li>
<li>Fixed graphical tearing issue</li>
<li>Fix some cases of bad rendering in virtual garage when accessing pause menu</li>
<li>PC Only: Removed displayed menus when enabling Nvidia Ansel</li>
<li>Fixed various Live Events UI issues</li>
<li>Fix a few “NoLoca” issues</li>
<li>Fixed wrong display of turbo on the HUD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved environmental sounds</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect audio in some languages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for peripherals (steering wheels, shifters, etc.)</li>
<li>Improved support for ultra-wide monitors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>300+ miscellaneous minor bug fixes, as well as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolved cases of hardlock after the first race of the onboarding</li>
<li>Fixed ELO not decreasing when abandoning ranked races</li>
<li>Fixed suspension issues on various cars</li>
<li>Prevented several cases where player could drive through NPCs in free roam</li>
<li>Fixed cases where AI would drive in the opposite way after finishing a race.</li>
<li>Improved pathfinding of GPS</li>
<li>Removed incorrect indication of a race at lvl 3 that should not exist.</li>
<li>Updated the price of special edition cars</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, KT Racing is hoping to capture more of the essence of Test Drive Unlimited through the seasonal updates that will put more of the lifestyle aspects into the game. The studio released a dev diary that explored some of these topics, such as how they could look at introducing cross-play at some point down the line, but currently have other focus points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Launch Dev Diary &amp; Next Steps" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2I14V-HqOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following launch server issues, KT and Nacon have also committed to giving some kind of compensation for affected players. It seems that they are still undecided as to the best way of doing this, though they are clear that there will not simply be a handout of Solar Coins currency or cosmetic items.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown review</a>, I said, “After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</p>

<p>The first clip is titled 'Dollman &amp; Tarman Member Introductions', and here we are formally introduced to Death Stranding 2's stop motion puppet. It all takes place on board that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">submarine we also got a peak at during January's State of Play</a>, which made everyone look a slightly deathly shade of blue.</p>

<p>Anyway, this puppet is Dollman and he is also rather partial to a song or two, as shown in a subsequent clip introducing us to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-that-was-elle-fanning-in-kojimas-mysterious-new-game-teaser">Elle Fanning's Tomorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-hires-deadpool-2-actress-for-mysterious-new-game">Shioli Kutsuna's Rainy</a>.</p>
<p>When these two characters are discussing babies being born, they begin singing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head, and Dollman joins in. Sam, being a good sport, removes the puppet from his waist (where he was clipped on to, I assume, a belt loop like a charm) and starts to shake him along to the rhythm. It is actually quite endearing.</p>

<p>The next clip is all about Heartman, who proudly tells Sam and Dollman he can "flatline any time, anywhere without worrying". He can also sleep standing up so has no need for beds, which does sound super useful.</p>

<p>Back to Dollman, this bit of Death Stranding 2 footage shows the puppet taking part in an in-game event video, dancing to a song called Horizon Dreamer by Daichi Miura. It is quite a bop, actually, and Dollman has moves!</p>
<p>The music for this is due to come out later today, I will keep my eyes out for it.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, Kojima Productions also gave us a look at Death Stranding 2's photo shoot event, which you can have with Rainy, Fragile (played by Léa Seydoux) and Tomorrow. </p>
<p>The three can be seen doing all kinds of poses for the camera, as well as throwing some stuffed Cryptobiotes about in a playful way. It looks really quite realistic, and I did a double take the first time this clip showed up on my feed.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 appears to still be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. How do you think it is looking so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've always thought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>'s roster was lacking something but couldn't put your finger (lickin') on it, Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada knows - it's Colonel Sanders.</p>
<p>Despite his best efforts, however, Harada hasn't been able to convince KFC to give the all-clear to include Sanders as a fighter - or, indeed, fashion a Waffle House-inspired fighting stage.</p>

<p>"A long time ago, I wanted to have Colonel Sanders from Kentucky Fried Chicken fight," Harada said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/">The Gamer</a>. "So, I asked to use Colonel Sanders and go to the head office in Japan."</p>
<p>Harada says his suggestion was turned down by a "bad look".</p>
<p>For a brief while, Harada simply concluded that KFC didn't want to share its iconic mascot with <em>any</em> game, but given he's since turned up in a dating simulator, the team has since presumed it's the fighting FKC takes issue with, not gaming itself.</p>
<p>"[Harada] went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and tried to get Colonel Sanders," game designer Michael Murray added.  "They weren't very open to the idea.</p>
<p>"[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them. But it just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are."</p>
<p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-will-see-series-bad-guy-heihachi-return-as-dlc-this-autumn">Heihachi Mishima, antagonist of the Tekken series, is set to make a return to the series in Tekken 8 this autumn</a>.</p>
<p>Heihachi's reveal was announced at this year's Evo fighting game esports event in a new trailer, along with a new story mode chapter called The Dark Awakens. He'll be the third DLC character added to the game since its release earlier this year, following Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Some games surprise you with a novel premise that lends itself perfectly to interactivity, whilst others take a tried and tested idea and refine it. Squirrel With a Gun doesn’t fit with either STYLE, instead being a jokey meme at heart but one that results in a surprisingly enjoyable game. It may not reach the heights of the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/22/untitled-goose-game-review-switch-pc/">Untitled Goose Game</a> but it is far more than the five minute gag that I initially expected. Coming across like a fusion of Postal 2 and Goat Simulator, what results is a third person stealth platformer action game that mixes and fuses genres to create a flawed but fun experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Squirrel With A Gun - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLwL8ZmivQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>The opening few minutes of the game see you trying to come to grips with the ridiculously floaty jumping controls of the titular rodent. This is not the best introduction to the game, as your critter is an awkward little sod and you’ll find yourself missing seemingly easy jumps until it clicks. Even when you become familiar with the controls they never really work as they should and not in a fun clumsy way.</p>
<p>Fortunately the majority of the game doesn’t require the precision of this early tutorial so perseverance is rewarded by a more enjoyable set of mechanics. Once you navigate the series of platforms and press a number of switches you unlock the first major collectable – a golden acorn. Swallowing this whole sets off an alarm and a mysterious agent clad in a flawless suit bursts into the room. It is here that you first pick up a pistol and the game begins in earnest.</p>


<p>There is no backstory as to why your squirrel begins the game in a secure facility or how he takes to gunplay quite so readily, but some clues are hinted at through the antagonists that are introduced in the form of boss fights after the two main hub areas are unlocked. Progress requires you to collect a certain number of golden acorns, and the more common currency version, in order to unlock abilities. The first of these is a remote controlled car that enables you to zip around the levels, but getting enough golden acorns requires you to explore the suburbs and solve a series of environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>Tracking your progress is made easier through using flagpoles at each location. These show how many collectables there are and which you have picked up. Alongside the golden acorns there are various costume pieces (some of which have gameplay modifiers) and reload tokens that increase your passive reload skill. Collecting these isn’t necessary to finish the game but much of the enjoyment to be had comes from solving the mini-puzzles that conceal them. These range from carefully making your way across a living room submerged in lava to quickly eliminating a set number of enemies and the wide variety does help to maintain interest across the six to eight hours it’ll take to complete.</p>

<p>Of course, the main draw of the game’s title is the gun and there are a few to unlock and choose from as you make your way through to the end. You begin with a simple pistol, but uzis, shotguns, grenade launchers and bazookas are available later on. Unlocking these requires you to take one from an enemy and then buy them from set spots around the levels. These are obviously important to defend yourself against the enemy agents, but gunplay is also key to traversal as shooting your guns whilst jumping gives you extra distance or height. Balancing between the hovering capability of an uzi and the extra height of a shotgun is key in solving many of the environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>While far from being triple AAA or even remotely polished, Squirrel With A Gun is competent graphically. Glitches are present, but these are a key part of the game’s charm. Enemies are mostly identical with only a few different enemy agent types but the visual design of the various areas is solid enough. Sound design is functional but the main takeaway is the boss fight music that goes harder than it has any right to, with a Babymetal meets early 2000s nu-metal vibe.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Squirrel With a Gun is more than just a jokey throwaway meme game, but in some ways this is its biggest downfall. There is so much potential in the central mechanics that is held back by floaty controls and so it falls between two stools. A little more refinement and this could have been a more solid experience, but as a joke it goes on too long. That being said, there is enough here to entertain if you can look past those control issues.	</p></div>

            <p>Despite his cinephile tendencies, one thing you can’t accuse Kojima of is being precious about how people experience his work. Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the <a href="https://youtu.be/3j3XizwzhEY">Tokyo Game Show</a>? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> scenes then. Watch them on your phone for <em>added kino</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s the “first public release of game footage,” say Kojima Productions, <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840230233418469515">via X</a>.</p>

<p>This one shows Norman Reedus’s Sam and Léa Seydoux’s Fragile in a grimy boat, meeting a skinsuitted George Miller as Tarman, who has an inky cat with wings sitting on his shoulder. I played and liked the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a lot, but I can’t remember any of the proper nouns, so you’ll have to forgive me for not using them. The ship’s dashboard is so wonderfully intricate I give it two weeks before Microprose make a game about it, and the ship’s wheel itself is a crisp projection that contrasts starkly with the decaying interior.</p>
<p>They have a chat about voyaging through the tar, and Fragile lights a cigarette with the hands on her top, which seems like an incredibly specific use for such an elaborate garment. We’re then introduced to floating puppet Dollman, who’s animated at a lower framerate to evoke old practical effects. I don’t use Twitter these days, although I’m almost tempted to sign up just so I can post about how the doll’s framerate ‘looks like a PS2 game lol’ and see how many people I can annoy.</p>
<p>Dollman insists he’s not actually a puppet - he’s alive! Alive or not, he certainly enjoys singing, as we’ll soon find out.</p>

<p>This one features Sam - now in full colour - still on what I assume is a ship, alongside Shioli Kutsuna’s Rainy and Ellle Fanning’s Tomorrow. Sam is wearing Dollman on his waist now. Rainy is pregnant, and they have a chat about birth and death. Again, I’ve forgotten much of the lore, but I distinctly remember Weird Baby Shit being one of the themes, so this all checks out. They have a singalong, Dollman and Sam insult each other a bit, and it’s on to clip number three. You should watch this one reflected in the back of a spoon.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>This one features Sam meeting Hartman from the last game in a spooky lab full of goop statues.  I’m really starting to curse my memory at this point. Hartman flips a hourglass over, then collect a tear in a dropper. I remember this all being significant and interesting but I can’t remember how. I foresee many ‘explained in 10 minutes’ videos in my future.</p>
<p>Ah, I do remember this place! It’s Hartman’s house in the mountains, the trek to which was a prime example of the sort of delightful ballache that comprises much of Death Stranding. Hartman has a new device that lets him fall over at weird angles and contorts to support his body, which looks brilliant amounts of fun.</p>
<p>The last two clips aren’t really cutscenes. One is an <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840235179761397869">excellent looking photo mode</a>, and another is a music video featuring <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840233883117465777">multiple dancing Dollmen</a>. I like what I see! But I would like to see Sam climbing a thing next, please. There’s only so many musical numbers I can take before I vow to only play Death Stranding 2 through goggles made out of toilet paper tubes, as Scorsese intended.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been keeping up, we last got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-a-trailer-and-2025-release-window-still-absolutely-bonkers">a trailer back in January</a>, alongside the announcement of a 2025 release window. Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-stranding-tells-the-worst-elements-of-open-world-games-to-take-a-hike">reviewed the original Death Stranding</a> in video form, calling it a “brilliant take on open world exploration; a full body cleanse of the genre’s worst habits.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Starfield Game Director Todd Howard was featured in a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1l54t9VcTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video interview</a> published on the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) YouTube channel, where the game designer talked about the inspirations for Bethesda's latest game.</p>
<p><em>Starfield, I mean, so many challenges. We pushed ourselves kind of in every part of the game. But the biggest challenge was, first, how do we generate these planets? Is that even a good idea? Okay, maybe at the time, no, but we made it work. You know, just, can we even generate a planet? And then once we could generate all of these, the simulation of the solar systems, around you. </em></p>
<p><em>But ultimately, it is; what's fun about that? So there's a technological challenge in making it work, but then there's a design challenge in how do you make that fun minute to minute and then hour to hour for everybody playing it?</em></p>
<p><em>When it comes to other media that's inspired us, it goes all the way from The Lord of the Rings. And then in science fiction there were so many: Interstellar, The Martian, Battlestar Galactica, the TV show. The show The Expanse, and there's so much science fiction out there. We wanted something that really felt kind of tactile that you believed how we got there from where we are today in our world to 300 years in the future.</em></p>
<p>Starfield is about to get its first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-gets-official-deep-dive-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space</a>, which will be unlocked later today on PC and Xbox Series S|X for $29.99 (owners of the Premium Edition have it included with their original purchase of the game). Here's an overview of what you can expect from it:</p>
<p><em>A mysterious force is stirring in the city of Dazra on the hidden homeworld of House Va'Ruun. Investigate a terrifying cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and equipment in this all-new adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>When a distress signal from an abandoned star station triggers a journey to Va'Ruun'kai, the veil of secrecy surrounding the worshippers of a deity known as "The Great Serpent" is finally lifted. Immerse yourself in the dark and complex world of House Va'Ruun as you navigate a tense political landscape, uncover the history of the Va'Ruun people, and help decide the fate of the faction in the wake of a cataclysmic event.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Bethesda did not send advance review codes for Starfield Shattered Space, so don't expect to see any reviews pop up today.</p>

            <p>Halloween is barely a month away and the Maw hoots and hiccoughs, demanding that I fill it up with original low-budget horror games, but I have no time for such things, because my thoughts are full of bread. Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 30th September, why not take a tour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> - don't sweat the wall-giraffes, they're meant to do that, I promise. Alternatively, set course for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-shattered-space-looks-like-a-wise-return-to-bethesda-basics">Starfield's Shattered Space DLC</a> to engage in some reportedly "back-to-basics" Bethesda role-playing, or piratical venture <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691190/Rogue_Waters/">Rogue Waters</a> if you like turn-based broadsides and boarding actions. On Tuesday 1st October, oh wow, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2990640/Endoparasitic_2/">Endoparasitic sequel</a>. Who knew having three limbs pulled off would make for such a bankable premise.  On Wednesday 2nd October, tinker with timelines to dissect triffids in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tarnished-blood">Tarnished Blood</a>. Or slam tilt the metroidvania in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601940/Pinball_Spire/">Pinball Spire</a>. Or stick it to Satan's legions in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-knight">Kill Knight</a>. On Thursday 3rd October, the delayed delivery of bike courier sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parcel-corps">Parcel Corps</a>. Also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107880/Gnomes_and_Knights/">Gnomes And Knights</a>, a low-poly dark fantasia which merrily describes itself as "A REAL opportunity to FINALLY find the gnomes" whose "Low price matches the level of content's quality". On Friday 4th October, finally, the chance to kill off an entire cabin of vexingly photogenic youth in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a>, or hole up in the garden shed with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">sounds amazing</a>.</p>
<p>You can read of more novelties and curiosities in our weekly liveblog below. If there's a novelty or curiosity we've overlooked, let us know in the comments so I can purse my lips and seethe impotently. Look at that, I went a whole paragraph without thinking about bread! But it is too late for me. There is a shop-fresh bag of Hovis multiseed in the kitchen, and I can hear it whispering to me yeastily through the plastic. Please share any great-looking games we've missed, and have a good week.</p><div data-live="true">

			<p>Games industry guru Hideo Kojima was featured in a lengthy interview <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Variety</a> ahead of TGS 2024, where he discussed most of his many projects. The first one is, of course, Death Stranding 2, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lot of new footage from TGS. Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O.D.</a>, the Microsoft exclusive game Kojima says is a 'risky' project since it is a game 'like no other.'</p>
<p><em>At the same time, I wanted to do something new that wasn’t “Death Stranding,” so I teamed up with Microsoft to create “O.D.” This is a game, but it’s a game like no other. I can’t go into too much detail, and it’s also hard to explain, but it’s a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games.</em></p>
<p>O.D. is being made in collaboration with renowned film director Jordan Peele, and it's far from the only game-movie intersection Kojima is working on. To start with, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming Death Stranding movie</a>, which was also discussed in the Variety interview:</p>
<p><em>I have only ever thought of “Death Stranding” as a game. People tell me it feels like a movie, but I made it as a game – the direction, the settings, the story. So, I don’t intend to look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective. Those works are my babies, and I love movies, so I want it to be something that movie fans will really enjoy! I’ll supervise the plot and help them make it, but I won’t direct it. I can’t right now with three ongoing projects! I’ll help by communicating with a director I really trust. There are several “Death Stranding” adaptation projects currently underway, but there is a different story I’ve written that’s intended for a movie. But I don’t have the time to direct it, so I won’t.</em></p>
<p>Finally, Kojima talked about the latest game <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, the stealth title Physint that will be made in partnership with PlayStation. There are already cross-media plans for that IP, too.</p>
<p><em>I’m in the second phase now and expanding the IP I made in all sorts of directions, but my other project, “Physint,” is like the gateway into the third phase. I’m trying to make it with people in filmmaking and industries outside of games. So, we may do a movie adaptation at the same time, but we will see. The assets are digital and can be used either way.</em></p>
<p>Which of these Kojima projects are you most excited about? Let us know below!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-gets-a-gigantic-4x-texture-pack.996015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-gigantic-4x-texture-pack/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 has received a pretty exciting texture mod. This mod utilizes AI tools to upscale low-resolution textures and provides an enhanced visual experience.</p>
<p>Texture mods in titles are a mainstay for PC gamers, especially in games like BG3, which has some inconsistencies in the overall texture environment. Apparently, the modder WestAard has released an HD Texture Pack for <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, which is around 27 GB in size, a massive number for a texture pack, but the interesting fact here is that this particular mod upscale the in-game textures by up to four times, using a node-based upscaling program called chaiNNer.</p>
<p><em>After a week of processing using a node-based upscaling program called chaiNNer, the mod is finally ready for release! It upscales textures 4x, so a 1K texture becomes 4K, and so on. For those who want high resolution textures that adhere to the vanilla vision, or a cover-all pack to serve as a foundation for custom-made textures, this will work wonders.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The modder further mentions that the texture pack doesn't include upscaling for armor and clothes, but every other mainstream graphic is upscaled through this particular pack.&nbsp; For BG3 users who are eager to go through a unique gaming experience, having this texture pack onboard is a must for them. According to the modder, if users desire the ultimate experience, they should also have the following set of texture packs equipped:</p>

<p>Below is an example screenshot with the mods installed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>However, it's important to note that you must have an upper-range system to get the ultimate experience out of the texture packs, so low-end PCs may suffer with the frame rate if they attempt to use these mods. The modding community always does its job when it comes to revamping the overall experience of a title, and in this case, Baldur's Gate 3's set of texture packs is a must-try out. Even more mods may be designed for the game following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent release of the mod tools</a>, increasing its longevity.</p>

<p>On October 1, ‘version two’ of the second public demo for Road to Vostok will be released on Steam. It has been more than two years since the first demo was published, and since then, the game’s solo developer has worked hard to pump more content into the trial product.</p>



<p>Check out the full list below to find out what’s coming in the next Road to Vostok demo update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-highly-anticipated">Highly Anticipated</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. It’s penned as a hardcore single-player survival FPS, and having played the first demo as soon as it was released, I can tell you that I’ve been invested for <strong>a long time</strong>. I can’t wait to see how Road to Vostok unravels, and on October 1, the next iteration of the popular demo will be released.</p>



<p>Since the first demo was released in 2022, Road to Vostok has evolved immeasurably. Everything from partnerships with real-world survival gear manufacturers to map expansions have been jammed into the game, which at present doesn’t have a full release date. </p>



<p>In May, the game won  Best Creative Achievement of the Year at the Finnish Game Awards <strong>and </strong>the developer surpassed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. There’s plenty of meat on the bones in this project, and here’s what’s coming to the second version of the public demo, available on October 1 on Steam:</p>
