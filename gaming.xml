            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back at Summer Game Fest in June,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth" rel="nofollow">I played some <em>Crimson Desert</em></a> and my mind was blown with just how dense its systems were. At PAX West, I had the chance to play a near identical demo on a new build but with a different focus and learned so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check out my previous preview linked above for information on the combat, as that is the same as what I experienced here. Suffice to say, it is complicated, dense, interconnected, and surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>For The Sake of Immersion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Interestingly, I was told they had four different people demoing the game at Summer Game Fest, each of them focusing on different aspects of the game to see how various previews would be written. Plus, they knew they would see some of us again at PAX West and other events, so they wanted to show us what wasn’t shown before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So where I had been hyper focused on combat before, I now got to see a lot more of the little details in the world and focus on immersion in <em>Crimson Desert.</em> Like with the combat, how you interact with the world was given the same attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way I can convey that is by just giving you a bunch of examples of what I saw and was shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, one thing the team wanted to boast about was that they have the largest mocap studio in Asia, and they put it to use on every animation in the game. From the idle stuff in the background to the insane wrestling moves in combat, everything started in the mocap studio.</p>



<p>That has led to a lot of deliberate movements that really sell what you see on screen. Two soldiers reacting excitedly to seeing your character, Kliff, a famous mercenary, comes across as genuine and real. Kneeling down to repair a wheel on a cart, kicking it on just looks right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those things that sounds so boring to write out and talk about, but it’s one of those subtle things that you don’t notice but can have a big effect. There’s a big difference between clicking a button and suddenly the cart is repaired to seeing it put back together. In the latter, it feels like a real world and not a video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the world the<em> Crimson Desert</em> team has put a lot of work into making. We spent a decent amount of time talking about that immersion and the small, seemingly insignificant details that all add up to sell the world to players.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like voices muffling and echoing when wearing a helmet that covers a character's face. That the skybox rotates during the day to change as the time of day changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one funny example, I was told that in another demo someone wanted to see if they could pick up the chickens that are running around. You sure can, and they learned the white chickens were picked up and held by their feet while you the lucky brown chickens are cradled in Kliff's arms. Something not even the demoer knew you could do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Change the World Around You</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw was in how ways you interact with the world logically affect the properties of certain things. For example, I caught a large wooden gate on fire and while it was still catching fire, I tried to smash through it with a big hit. The gate was too strong and withstood the attack.</p>

<p>It was explained to me that inanimate objects have a sort of damage threshold that needs to be hit first before any damage can be done to them, sort of like in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some time, the gate burned up completely and looked very different, all black and charred. I then tried to smash through the gate again with a big attack, and this time I broke on through.</p>

<p>The fire had not just changed what the gate looked like visually, it had weakened the material just like what would happen in real life.</p>



<p>It’s that sort of logical detail that is littered throughout<em> Crimson Deser</em>t that I think it will delight people for a long time. A lot of moments of “I can’t believe the game can do that” will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s so much granular detail that has been given a ton of attention and so many systems that all work together in a logical and intuitive way that the possibilities to do cool stuff are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being surprised by what is there is a big part of what they are going for with<em> Crimson Desert.</em>&nbsp;I saw that born out in this demo and my previous hands-on, as not only am I surprised at what the game could do so were the developers showing it off.</p>

<p>Part of keeping that surprise a big part of the game comes down to player choice. You have a ton of options in combat, how to move around the world, and just how to interact with all of the objects in it. I haven't seen much on the story or player choices that come into play there, but I can't wait to hear more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/io-interactive-might-be-done-with-third-party-publishing-after-mindseye.1288623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>publisher IO Interactive has suggested that the game's disastrous launch may have made the studio think twice about taking on third-party publishing contracts in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to IGN</a>, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak said that while his studio will continue to publish its own games, whether or not the IOI Partners label publishes any more third-party games "remains to be seen".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>, which is the debut project from the "multinational" studio Build a Rocket Boy, was IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">first external publishing effort</a>, and it's safe to say the game's launch didn't exactly go as either studio had hoped it would.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=JY2N_wf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mindseye-io-interactive-publishing-shooting.jpg?itok=t0Om158X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>IO Interactive may think twice about third-party publishing after&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">roundly negative reception</a>, with its messy launch encountering widely-reported technical issues, leading to developer Build a Rocket Boy severing a planned sponsorship with streamer CohhCarnage, as well as PlayStation issuing rare refunds to players.</p>

<p>The launch of the game went so poorly that Build a Rocket Boy announced later that month that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">lay off over 100 employees</a>, which, according to an IGN report, constituted around a third of the studio's headcount at the time.</p>

<p>IO Interactive CEO Abrak described&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s launch as "definitely tough"; he said the release "wasn't what [Build a Rocket Boy] hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners".</p>

<p>Despite that, Abrak says that Build a Rocket Boy is "working hard on turning that around to regain the trust" of disgruntled players, and that&nbsp;<em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>has "tons of potential and content" in the pipeline. We'll have to wait and see if any of that comes to fruition.</p>




<p>IO Interactive's third-party publishing efforts may be on hold for the moment, but the studio is powering ahead with publishing its own releases, the next of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" rel="nofollow">March's&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>. Here's hoping that launch goes better than&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em>'s.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Amazon's making this killer 20-core processor an absolute steal at just $259, hundreds less than you would pay for an all-new PC tower.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Would you swap out your car’s motor for a nitro-burning drag engine if you could do it yourself and do it for pennies on the dollar? Of course you would, but unfortunately, unless you’re an automotive expert with a killer garage and a death wish, you can’t. But you can do the PC desktop equivalent of that kind of massive power upgrade — it’s easy, and while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">Amazon’s selling the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $259 during a limited-time deal, it’s peanuts compared to the price of buying a whole new desktop rig.</a></p>
<p>This is a terrific deal for anyone looking to transform a blah PC desktop into a raging speed demon, but it’s especially great if you’re a gamer looking to upgrade a rig or are thinking about building your own from scratch. With 8 performance cores and 12 efficient cores, and that awesome max clock speed of 5.5GHz, the Intel Core Ultra 7 is begging to be the engine for high-end lag-free PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>More Than Speed</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is compatible with Intel 800 Series Chipset-based motherboards, and supports PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, along with DDR5. It’s clearly a speed demon, with more than enough horsepower to blast your way through the most rugged action games and shooters, but those performance and efficient cores also let your PC run cooler, which means less power consumption and less chance of sustaining overheating-related damage.</p>
<p>There’s a significant brain upgrade with the Intel Core Ultra 7 too, in addition to all that brawn. Intel’s Ultra processor-based AI is the key to better streaming and gaming than ever before, with an NPU that takes on tasks like background removal and auto-framing and applies AI to them to create the smoothest gaming and streaming experience yet.</p>



<h2>Optimization Across the Board</h2>
<p>The Core Ultra 7 processor features Intel’s Application Optimization tech, a customizable way to devote more of the processor’s incredible power to the games and applications you want to give a max boost to. The user interface lets you see which games are optimized, and to turn it on or off for individual games as you see fit. Combined with Ultra processor-based AI, this is future-proofed gaming guaranteed, with the absolute maximum speed and performance always at the ready.</p>
<p>Buying an all-new PC desktop with this much power is an expensive proposition indeed, and now thanks to this limited-time deal at Amazon, it’s one you can skip entirely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">With the price of the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor slashed by 36%, all the way down to $259</a>, the smart choice is to perform a little DIY brain surgery on your existing PC, or build one around this monster processor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light developers have just confirmed that they used Daniel Craig’s head on Agent 47 to pitch the game.</p>



<p>007 First Light received its first gameplay yesterday at the exclusive State of Play event, along with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. Since then, players have begun forming impressions about the game, and the developers have also come forward to say it isn’t a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reskin</a>” of Hitman. Now, new details have been revealed about how Daniel Craig’s likeness was used when pitching 007 First Light. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-was-pitched-with-daniel-craig-s-head-on-agent-47">007 First Light Was Pitched with Daniel Craig’s Head on Agent 47</h2>



<p>IOI CEO, Hakan Abrak, confirmed during an interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-007/240656/news/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Daniel Craig’s head was placed on Agent 47 and put into World of Assassination when they demoed 007 First Light. Abrak reveals, “We actually did put Daniel Craig in there”, and they modeled his head and placed it instead of Agent 47. This was done for demo purposes only, to provide “an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game.”</p>



<p>Abrak adds that players who are familiar with a level called “Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound”, should know that some things were shown off there and “it was well received” The CEO explained that they were trying to convey that this is a “360 experience”, which is not just shooting and cutscenes, but also explores the “Bond Fantasy” in social spaces where the character needs to use his “charms and bluff” instead of his fists.</p>



<p>Abrak revealed that this was the first time they had worked on something other than original worlds and characters, and it was essential for them to put their “creative fingerprints” on it. They weren’t interested in “a gamification of a movie or maybe where it’s about technical prowess only, like pushing the pixels on Pierce Brosnan, for example, or just taking some bespoke scenes from a movie and realizing them in gaming.”</p>



<p>Instead, the developers want to create a “game for gamers” which brings players “a genuine Bond experience” where Bond is yet to become the world’s most famous spy and is still learning the ropes of the trade. </p>



<p>In other news, 007 First Light’s collector’s edition will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-collectors-edition-will-set-you-back-300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set players back $300</a>. Additionally, nsider Gaming received an exclusive&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Preview</a>&nbsp;for 007 First Light and “couldn’t stop seeing Hitman with a James Bond skin.” What are your thoughts on IOI using Daniel Craig’s likeness to pitch 007 First Light?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Other Games - Silksong Day" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/085fd316af72f/other-games-silksong-day.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For many of you, today – <strong>4th September, 2025</strong> – will forever be known for one reason: the day that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>But of course, while Silksong will undoubtedly soak up a <em>heck</em> of a lot of attention, the day doesn't just belong to one game. In fact, there are quite a few titles launching on the Switch eShop, and we'd like to highlight a few that we think deserve a bit of attention.</p>
<p>Yes, the brave souls behind these games have decided, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay-to-avoid-silksong">unlike others</a>, not to delay their intended release in order to avoid clashing with Silksong. That warrants the doffing of one's hat, if you ask us. We're not going to cover everything launching today, because frankly the Switch is still being bombarded with some rather questionable games, but there are definitely a few that are worth looking into.</p>
<p>So if you're <em>really</em> not keen on checking out Silksong, then perhaps one of the following might be more up your alley...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="adventure-of-samsara"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a></h2>
<p>Atari's latest is a classic metroidvania that pays homage to the original <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from the Atari 2600. Developed by Ilex Games, its heavy, slow-paced movement and combat are almost the exact opposite to Silksong's more free-flowing gameplay. Still, we thought it was decent and awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/adventure-of-samsara">7/10</a> in our recent review.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:186856 @ 1756991281 -->
<h2 id="camper-van-make-it-home"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/camper_van_make_it_home">Camper Van: Make it Home</a></h2>
<p>One of our favourite games in recent weeks was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, which we described as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">"epitome of cosy"</a>. Camper Van: Make It Home looks to provide the same kind of vibes, albeit with a lot more focus on meticulously decorating and rearranging the interior and exterior of your camper van. It looks lovely, and a fine way to escape from the drab reality of life.</p>


<h2 id="dark-deity-2"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a></h2>
<p>Developer Sword &amp; Axe made a point of sticking to its guns and launching Dark Deity 2 alongside Silksong, and we commend such bravery. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">The first game</a> was a lovely spin on <strong>Fire Emblem</strong>'s gameplay, and the sequel looks to take this even further. If you're into retro-inspired tactical RPGs, then this might be worth checking out.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:187061 @ 1756990855 -->
<h2 id="fling-to-the-finish"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fling_to_the_finish">Fling to the Finish</a></h2>
<p>This one admittedly wasn't on our radar, but upon viewing the recent console trailer, it actually looks like a whale of a time. It's one of those multiplayer games where you have to work alongside a partner to reach the end of the level. The twist here is that you're literally tied together with an elastic band, and so you need to fling your partner up walls and across gaps to succeed. It's got local and online support with cross-platform compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="splatterbot"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a></h2>
<p>Do you like <strong>Splatoon</strong>? Of course you do, for goodness' sake. Well, Splatterbot is remarkably similar in that you face off against up to three local competitors to make the most mess in each stage. So each player (or team) is designated a certain colour, and all you have to do is cover as much of the ground as possible while slamming into your enemies to knock them off-course. It looks awesome!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:169277 @ 1756990855 -->
<h2 id="mandragora-whispers-of-the-witch-tree"><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a></h2>
<p>Another action RPG to add to the list, Mandragora appeared on other consoles recently and has now joined the fray on the Switch. We're not completely sold on the visuals here, but the artistic design is solid and the gameplay looks like it could potentially scratch that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> itch.</p>

<hr>
<p>So that's yer lot! Reckon we've missed anything here? Then let us know with a comment down in the usual place. And no, we're not including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> here; that one's big enough on its own thanks to Ubisoft and Disney. We'll have a review for you soon though, don't worry about that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed the start date for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, as well as the two heroes that will be joining the hero shooter's roster during this season.</p>

<p>The game's fourth season, which (naturally) follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-3" rel="nofollow">its third back in July</a>, will begin on September 12th. As usual, it's bringing two new heroes with it, one of which may be a little more obscure than the other.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first new hero for Season 4 is none other than Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who's sporting a characteristically flamboyant new design in keeping with many of the game's other characters. We don't know what role Daredevil will play in the game yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=Y44658sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-4-daredevil-angela.jpg?itok=bbgKeXvI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daredevil and Angela will be joining&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster this season.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new hero (although she's actually the first to join&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' roster for this season) is Angela, who began life as an Image Comics character appearing in the&nbsp;<em>Spawn&nbsp;</em>series before debuting in Marvel's&nbsp;<em>Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>run in 2013.</p>

<p>Angela is a Vanguard (that's&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' tank class) whose Ichors can transform into various weapons, including a shield, so she can either block damage or open up "opportunities for her team", according to NetEase. She can also take to the skies to search for new angles of attack.</p>

<p>Of course, the new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season will also bring with it a range of new game modes, changes to various game mechanics, and a brand new Team-Up attack as well, so make sure you check out the patch notes when they're released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can watch this rather wonderfully-animated trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 4, which depicts an epic clash between Angela and Daredevil.</p>




<p>The Season 4 trailer also confirmed a PS4 release for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which will presumably arrive alongside the fourth season next week. Whether or not the console can handle some of NetEase's game's busier moments remains to be seen.</p>

<p>For now, however, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>After rapidly declaring that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">looking into action</a> the other day, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have released a hotfix aiming to rectify some of the crashing that's affected players diving Into the Unjust.</p>
<p>Unlike the giant worms I've still seen hide nor mandible of, it didn't take the studio long to address reports of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">uptick in technical issues</a> for the shooter following the update's arrival on Tuesday. Here's hoping that these fixes'll help keep thing a bit more stable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516346126609155527?l=english">hotfix 01.004.001</a>, which has arrived just after the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516345493302804917?l=english">Dust Devils warbond</a>, are pretty short, so I'll aim to ward off my worst tendencies and keep it brief.</p>
<p>Fixes for crashes related to particle effects, post-reinforcement hellpodding, "if the target of a seeking missile gets deleted before impact", aborting missions while driving, or just fighting the automatons in general. All check. Issues with the update's new caves becoming "darker than intended" when on lower graphics settings and an opposing problem with hellpads emitting excessively bright light. Dealt with.
</p><p>The warp pack "getting stuck suspended in the air or crashing". Sorted. Erratic extraction shuttle landings. Rendered a lot safer. Also, the speargun's reload time's been dialled down and the Dust Devils gear's solo silo stratagem's immediately had its cooldown quickened by half a minute.</p>
<p>One fix that isn't in there is for freezing issues <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/1/591780546280097257/">some PC players have reported running into</a> since late August, with machines apparently becoming unresponsive to the point a manual button-press shutdown required. However, over on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1218153537914273802/1411297235425169409">Discord</a>, a player support agent with the handle Bvits has at least said they've "alerted the team that this is happening to some players, they're looking into it".</p>
<p>Right, there you go. Zippy. Succinct. Concise. No rambling here. If you want that, go read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/giant-new-bug-worms-of-helldivers-2-i-will-find-you-and-i-will-watch-someone-else-kill-you">my impressions from a few hours of Terminid hive world missioning</a> on Tuesday evening.</p>

              <p>It seems reports of the death of Amazon Prime’s <em>Tomb Raider</em> series may have been greatly exaggerated. The UK’s execrable <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner-1851775643">reported earlier this year</a> that “sources” had said the project, scripted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Killing Eve</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>), was dead. However, it’s now being reported elsewhere that the show is still in development, and that&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>‘ Sophie Turner is confirmed to be in the lead role.</p> <p>We already knew Turner was intended to play Lara Craft in this latest attempt to convert&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> from games to screens, with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-tomb-raider-tv-lara-croft-sophie-turner-1851685114">rumors first appearing in October 2024</a>, then <a href="https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-amazon-tomb-raider-1851699063">seeming more substantial in November</a>. Six months later the errant report that the whole project had derailed appeared, and things have been quiet since. But now both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sophie-turner-lara-croft-amazon-tomb-raider-series-2-1236360099/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/"><em>Variety</em> are reporting</a> that not only are things still progressing, but that filming is due to start soon-ish. The official date, according to <em>Variety</em>, is January 19, 2026 for shooting to begin, with Sophie Turner officially confirmed by Amazon MGM as appearing in the lead role.</p> <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge is still in place as writer and executive producer, but is now joined by Chad Hodge (<em>Wayward Pines</em>,&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>) as co-showrunner. The latter seems likely to be due to the obvious stalling in development since the show was announced in 2023. Waller-Bridge became a massively hot property after the breakout success of dark comedy <em>Fleabag</em>, and then the international hit&nbsp;<em>Killing Eve</em>. Signing a colossal eight-figure deal with Amazon to develop shows, the writer has since exited Donald Glover’s revival of <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith </em>due to creative differences, and after <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/phoebe-waller-bridge-renews-amazon-overall-deal-1235310198/">renewing the contract in 2023</a>, is said to have been working on a yet-to-appear version of Claudia Lux’s <em>Sign Here</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. With the new announcement, it seems that finally&nbsp;<em>something</em> is going into production.</p>

 <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge released a statement saying, “I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,” the latter also including Jonathan Van Tulleken (<em>Shogun</em>) as a director. She added, “It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave and hilarious as she is.”</p> <p>Sophie Turner also released a comment. “I am thrilled beyond measure to be playing Lara Croft,” the&nbsp;<em>Joan</em> actor said. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many—and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>

 <p>Turner is the third person to attempt to portray Croft on screens, following Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander in previous movie outings. “They’re massive shoes to fill,” Turner says of the previous actors, “but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands.”</p> <p>There does seem more reason to be optimistic about this new version of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>. Turner is a solid choice for the super-posh lead, already having the clipped English tones of previous voice actors for the games, like Judith Gibbons and Keeley Hawes, and Waller-Bridge is demonstrably one of the most capable television writers of the generation, with her ability to combine weighty drama with genuine laughs. Letting Lara have a sense of humor is something grimly forgotten in the last three games, and it’ll be lovely to see that return. Clearly, with filming not starting until next year, and likely a very lengthy post-production for SFX, the show is still a very long way off. Holiday 2026 seems optimistic at this point, so we’ve a heck of a wait to find out how it will all work out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-dying-light-the-beast-have-early-access.1288584/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whenever a game is delayed, the desire to play it as soon as possible intensifies. Dying Light: The Beast fans have had to experience this pain, which is why early access would be a terrific boon to lessen the wait.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> was delayed by 4 weeks. If it was the game you were most looking forward to in 2025, I can imagine you’ve been in your own zombie-like state throughout August and the early parts of September. Techland seems confident in The Beast’s revised release date. I can tell you that Insider Gaming’s recent hands-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview</a> should give you cause for excitement.</p>



<p>It’s hit and miss if single-player games have early access—which is where Dying Light: The Beast comes into the undead equation.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-with-early-access">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A hop, a skip, and a thump. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of writing, there is no Dying Light: The Beast early access, meaning the first real opportunity to play the game is via its September 19 release date.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dying Light: The Beast</a> <em>does </em>have a special deluxe edition. But it doesn’t feature 24, 48, or even 7-day early access. It includes special cosmetic skins, the game’s official soundtrack, and other handy in-game items. But there’s definitely no early access to get you to part ways with more money.</p>



<p>In fairness, the deluxe edition is only a handful of dollars more than the standard edition. If it did offer early access, I expect there’d be a greater discrepancy in price. As an old-school gamer, I’m happy when games don’t offer this, as it’s better when everyone can jump in together on the same day, avoid spoilers, and get a chance to experience the hilarious and bizarre antics in unison.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-dying-light-the-beast-demo">Is There A Dying Light: The Beast Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s not even a Dying Light: The Beast demo for you to get a small taster of what’s to come.</strong></p>



<p>Techland is adamant about the game’s content. The only way you play Dying Light: The Beast is on release day. If you need snippets of gameplay and details on the game and its development, though, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@InsiderGamingTrailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Trailers</a> YouTube page has a ton of Dyihng Light: The Beast content to watch.</p>

<p>007 First Light developers have clarified that it isn’t a reskin of Hitman and is different in many aspects. </p>



<p>007 First Light received an exclusive State of Play event yesterday, which featured 30 minutes of gameplay along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date announcement</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order details</a>. Since then, a new interview has emerged in which the developers have clarified that the James Bond game is distinct from Hitman. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-s-driving-was-a-huge-challenge">007 First Light’s Driving Was A “Huge Challenge”</h2>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-is-not-a-reskin-of-hitman-io-interactive-says-again-and-the-team-brought-in-amazing-fresh-talent-including-devs-with-specific-driving-expertise-to-help-build-car-missions/">GamesRadar+</a>, senior licensing producer Theuns Smit explained how Hitman and 007 First Light are two different games. Smit first talked about how they have a very talented team that has expanded significantly since the game was announced. They were able to bring in fresh talent, which, along with the existing staff, became “a really big growth moment” for the studio. </p>



<p>The new developers were able to bring in “fresh eyes, fresh expertise, all of that” while also relying on IO Interactive’s strengths and their 25 years of massive experience. However, Smit explains that it is about the game and experience first, stating, “If you’re looking at Hitman, it’s the way it is for a particular reason, because that’s the gameplay experience we want to give. For Bond, it’s not exactly that. It’s not a reskin of that.”</p>



<p>Smit then spoke about driving, describing it as “absolutely a huge challenge,” and they had to bring on developers with driving expertise, which included “people that had experience coding, setting up, tweaking, balancing.” He added that it is “a balancing act of making a vehicle feel both exciting, credible, and dangerous at the same time as being approachable and fun for a wide audience.” Finding this balance was difficult and a “new adventure” for them, but they feel they have “landed in an amazing space.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next Lara Croft has been cast, with Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role in Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>Also announced were the creative leads for the show. Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as creator, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner, while Jonathan Van Tulleken is director and executive producer, and Chad Hodge joins as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>


<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>
<p>Turner said she was “thrilled beyond measure” and that “[Lara Croft is] such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got.”</p>
<p>Waller-Bridge, meanwhile, said that “Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.” Adding,&nbsp;“Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming.”</p>

<p>Her creative leadership will be fascinating to see come through. Waller-Bridge had plenty of credits and significant moments before really making a name for herself with BBC black comedy show Fleabag – based on her one-woman show from a few years prior – and then with writing and executive producing for the TV adaptation of Killing Eve. She was then brought in to co-write Daniel Craig’s final outing as James Bond, No Time To Die, and starred on screen as Helena Shaw in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p>
<p>Production on the show is set to start in January of next year, with the series heading to Amazon Prime when it’s good and ready.</p>
<p>No word on how Crystal Dynamics is getting on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/amazon-tomb-raider-universe-game-tv-show-movie/">their latest Tomb Raider reboot</a>, though…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed who's going to be taking the role of Lara Croft in its upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, as well as when the show is expected to begin production.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;</em>star Sophie Turner will be playing Lara in the show, which is set to start production on January 19th next year. It's not yet known whether the series will adapt an existing game or tell a new, original story.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">back in May last year</a>.&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>writer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is attached to the project as one of its showrunners and executive producers, alongside Chad Hodge, whose credits include the likes of Fox's&nbsp;<em>Wayward Pines&nbsp;</em>and TNT's&nbsp;<em>Good Behavior</em>.</p>

<p>The live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series also isn't the only Lara Croft-starring show currently on the scene; it joins Netflix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">animated series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>, which is set in the same timeline as Crystal Dynamics' rebooted games.</p>

<p>As for the games, the latest release in the franchise is&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</em>, which, as the name suggests, collects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">remastered versions of the final three games</a> in the original Core Design series of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>titles.</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game is also apparently in the works, and according to developer Crystal Dynamics, the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">wasn't affected by a recent round of layoffs</a> that hit the studio following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">cancellation of The Initiative's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development outfit.</p>




<p>Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series will begin production in January, but we don't have an air date for it yet. Stay tuned for more on this one and on all things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-related.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-disastrous-launch-could-sink-io-interactive%E2%80%99s-publishing-push.1288554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MindsEye's terrible launch may have impacted more than developer Build a Rocket Boy's future, judging from some recent statements from Io Interactive's CEO Hakan Abrak.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">IGN</a>, the company's CEO talked about collaborating with Build a Rocket Boy, saying that the publisher appreciated some of the great ideas the developer had for their game and the great world in the background, and wanted to help them distribute the game. MindsEye's launch, however, was terrible and far from what IO Interactive hoped for its IOI Partners publishing push. As such, the company will continue to self-publish its own titles, like the upcoming 007 First Light, but may not publish other studios' games in the future.</p>



<p>MindsEye is among the worst-reviewed games of the year, and it's easy to understand why, as it is a very underwhelming experience that would require a ton of work to reach an acceptable level of quality. Unfortunately, it seems like these improvements will take a long time to get implemented, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">updates have become less frequent</a> since July, with developers getting<a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> layed off</a> from the studio following the game's release. Likewise, a cross-over with the Hitman series was also delayed, and with today's statements from the IOI CEO, it wouldn't be surprising for it to never see the light of day.</p>



<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Roblox will roll out selfie-based "facial age estimation technology" as a mandatory requirement for all of its players, as part of efforts to "limit communications" between minors and adults they don't know.</p>
<p>The corporation behind the massive game filled with smaller games, many of which are made by young people, say they aim to bring in this measure by the end of 2025. The news is part of a "long-term" vision for child safety in the wake of the US state of Louisiana's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/louisiana-attorney-general-sues-roblox-calling-platform-perfect-place-rcna225144">lawsuit against Roblox Corporation over child safety concerns</a>, with Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill accusing the game of being a "overrun with harmful content and child predators".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman wrote in <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">an announcement</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-to-begin-using-facial-age-estimation-technology-on-its-users-promises-to-limit-communication-between-adults-and-minors-unless-they-know-each-other-in-the-real-world/">PC Gamer</a> that this age estimation tech will be deployed to everyone who uses the game's built-in communications systems, and will work alongside the likes of ID age verification and parental consent to "provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account." On top of that, they promise "new systems" to limit minors' interactions with adult strangers.
</p>
<p>"We’re taking this step as part of our long-term vision as a platform for all ages," Kaufman added. "We expect that our approach to communication safety will become best practice for other online platforms, whether lawmakers pass laws requiring age verification for all platforms in the future or not."</p><p>Roblox's facial age estimation works by "analysing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features", at which point the user's assigned to one of three groups, under 13, over 13, and over 18. The experience the game offers changes based on which bucket folks land in, and "certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox" for those flagged as under 13 years old.</p>
<p>So, it's a slightly more in-depth iteration of the photo-based age checks you may well have had to do as part of the measures many sites and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-begin-rolling-out-xbox-account-age-verification-checks-in-response-to-uk-online-safety-act">services</a> have launched in response to the UK's Online Safety Act, with the likes of credit card and ID checks often being the alternatives. These checks haven't proven to be totally bulletproof (hello, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord">Norman Reedus' Death Stranding mug</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the legal action from Louisiana, Roblox has also faced child safety criticism from politicians like <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition">Democrat Ro Khanna</a>. This isn't the first time the game has made headlines for mistreatment of children, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting game creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers also having been lobbied at it. </p>
<p>Those behind Roblox have annoucned other steps recently to protect kids who are hopping in for a bit of Grow a Garden. That's included <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">cracking down on "vigilantes"</a> who were impersonating minors in an alleged effort to catch adults behaving inappropriately, something the game's overseers argued was only confusing matters.</p>

<p>Techland is set to make us all feel alive again with Dying Light: The Beast—the third mainline entry in the survival horror series. If you want to know Dying Light: The Beast’s release date and launch times, you’ve come to the right, safe place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dying-light-docket-codes-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> has been a long time coming. What started as DLC has become a beast within its own right. The Beast is smaller but more focused and dense compared to Dying Light 2. Old-school fans are thrilled to learn that OG protagonist Kyle Crane is back—even if he has become an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpected thirst trap</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve loved Dying Light: The Beast in our initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-preview-evolution-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming previews</a>. So let’s see its release date and what to expect.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Ready for some more? Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Dying Light: The Beast is locked in for a September 19 release date across various platforms.</strong></p>



<p>The hearts of the Dying Light community were broken back in July 2025 when Techland announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast was delayed by 4 weeks</a>. The official reasons given were “To allow for extra polishing work” and “Finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscene and player animations further.”</p>



<p>Again, we’ve played The Beast, and the improvements are noticeable. Expectations are very high for Dying Light: The Beast, and its release date (and start times) can’t come soon enough.</p>

<p>A Batman Arkham Shadow sequel will be entering development soon, according to the comments of a voice actor. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is the Batman title every player is looking forward to at the moment; however, there might be another title soon entering development that will feature the Caped Crusader.

            <p>
Roblox has announced it will expand its age estimation requirement to all users of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">platform introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Now, in a new statement, the company plans to roll out age verification for all users, through facial age estimation, ID age verification, and verified parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Roblox also plans to limit communication between adults and minors, unless they know each other in the real world.
</p>
<p>
"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content," reads the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">statement from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a>. "We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow."
</p>
<p>
In addition to age estimation, Roblox has made a number of other advancements in its safety features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Trusted Connections, as per its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">previous update</a>, to safeguard communication</li>
<li>Using its open-source AI system Roblox Sentinel to detect early signs of child endangerment</li>
<li>Improving voice and text filters</li>
<li>Rolling out new technology to detect specific servers where large numbers of users are breaking rules</li>
<li>Refining its avatar detection model to scan for player characters breaking rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since January 2025, Roblox has shipped over a hundred safety initiatives in an effort to prove its commitment to child safety.
</p>
<p>
This is in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">numerous reports of questionable safety</a>, for which Roblox has long been criticised.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-reportedly-making-the-ps5-slim-digital-edition-worse.1288524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new revision of the PlayStation 5 is reportedly on the way, with Sony deciding that, instead of price increases, they might give shrinkflation a try instead for PS5 model CFI-2100. Specifically for the PS5 Slim Digital Edition, the built-in SSD is set to decrease in size from 1TB back to 825GB.</p>
<p>Japanese regulatory documents were picked up on by <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">Japanese site Kunkoko in June</a>, with reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">billbil-kun on French deals site Dealabs</a> now furthering this information for how Sony plan to launch the new revision.</p>


<p>PS5 model CFI-2100, also termed as Chassis E, will also have other internal tweaks and efficiencies while retaining the now standard PS5 Slim outer design. Strangely, billbil-kun reports that Sony will split production of this chassis beyond just whether or not there is a disc drive attached, so now the lower-priced Digital Edition will only come with 825GB, while the Standard edition with a disc drive will still have 1TB, as was typical since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">PS5 Slim’s debut in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>An expected release into the European market is coming on 13th September, with the current €499.99 digital edition and €549 standard edition pricing remaining since earlier this year. The separate disc drive will remain at €79.99, but it makes the digital edition even worse value than trying to find an extra €50.</p>
<p>The days of games consoles getting cheaper are seemingly well and truly gone. While Sony has made significant hardware changes to their console since launch, bringing die shrunk chipsets, reducing the size of heat sink, shrinking the console as a whole, and more, they’ve not reduced the price over time. Certainly, it has been a difficult half decade with a pandemic, massive supply chain issues, and then economic inflation, and now US tariffs all hampering their ability to do this, but it’s still pretty galling that Sony and Microsoft have both chosen to make their console hardware more expensive over time.</p>

<p>The PS5 Digital Edition has been the focus of increasing prices this year, having started at £349 / €399 in 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/25/ps5-price-rise/">jumping to £389 / €449 in 2022</a>, holding that price with the Slim redesign and 1TB SSD increase in 2023 (at the cost of including a vertical stand), but having both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">a price increase to £429 / €499</a> and now an SSD reduction in 2025. By contrast, the Standard Edition has merely increased by £30 / €50, so Sony is really just shrinking the value margin between the two, for the time being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The development of Valve's HLX project, speculated to be Half-Life 3, is proceeding with optimization, changes to gameplay mechanics, and new features.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, known Valve dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a> provided an overview of every update made for the HLX project found in the most recent Counter-Strike 2 update. While no major change has been introduced, quite a bit of work has been done on the project, with the expansion of the vehicle system, a new particle system specifically made for HLX that will handle liquids, a friction system, and a new system that will determine what happens when an enemy part is destroyed.</p>



<p>The most notable changes introduced in the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 in what has been Valve's busiest month in decades, looking at Perforce activity, the version control software used by the company that creates builds based on the most recent version of files, are related to optimization. For example, a new system that logs how much time is needed to load any game element has been introduced, suggesting work on load times optimization. Also, some cleanup and further optimization have been made in the enemy AI files, specifically for the system determining how an enemy reacts to events. This is particularly notable, as doing optimization work on these systems suggests the game is content locked. From this alone, it is impossible to tell when the project speculated to be Half-Life 3 will be revealed, but the fact that such work is being done suggests that the wait is definitely becoming shorter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it was rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">Half-Life 3 HLX could finally be revealed this Summer,</a> the project remains a complete mystery. Although there's still this year's The Game Awards show, it's unlikely Valve will need any major gaming event to unveil what may be one of the most anticipated games of all time, so an announcement could really be coming at any time, to the joy of all those who have continued to be fans of the series despite its absence from the spotlight.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has sold more copies on Xbox than PlayStation within the first six days of launch. </p>



<p>The Xbox launch has been a great plan for Helldivers 2, contributing to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-player-numbers-surge-on-steam-after-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player count</a> in recent days as well. Moreover, Arrowhead has also released the collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-collab-with-halo-odst-lands-with-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HALO ODST</a> alongside this launch, along with all the content the game has released since launch may have helped push more players over the edge. Now, new sales details for Helldivers 2 on Xbox have been revealed.</p>

            <p>SEGA has announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> R.E.V.O. World Stage - a new and improved version of the 3D fighting game - will be getting a closed beta test on 11th September.</p>
<p>Players on PC eager to take part will have to request access to the closed beta on the Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/">Steam page</a> to hop in, while console players must create a SEGA account to receive a code <a href="https://www.sega.com/">from the campaign website</a>.</p>
<p>The closed beta will feature online matchmaking including a ranked mode, an offline training mode, and an offline arcade mode. So both competitive ranked ladder climbers and combo lab monsters should have plenty to do.</p>

			<p>The humble scrolling beat ‘em up has been experiencing something of a golden age in recent years, with the indie-scene enjoying a resurgence in the old-school coin-fed darling. We’ve seen modern reimagining’s of arcade classics, beat ‘em ups with roguelite elements, and even attack inputs controlled with a thumb-stick. Now, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra BOOM</a>, we’re witnessing a scrolling beat ‘em up combined with a scrolling shoot ‘em up. Oh, and it includes space cheer leaders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKowKZpM2Ow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A rogue AI has taken over the world. We’re not told why, but maybe it got fed up with answering inane questions about Roman sanitary systems, or perhaps that’s just me? Either way, humanity has fled to a space colony to survive, but doesn’t give up hopes of fighting back. No, we’ve actually been preparing for counter AI’s aggression by… training up a group of cheerleading heroes – Saida, Aris, Vee, and Ren – to take the fight back Earth and free the world from its oppressive digital overlord.</p>


<p>What follows is a bold, bright, Saturday-morning cartoon inspired adventure in which you and up to three friends get to beat seven shades of oil out of hordes of despotic, yet oddly charming, robots. Visually Ra Ra Boom stands out with it over-the-top characters designs and a punchy colour palette. Animation is slick and smooth, our heroes cartwheeling, sliding, and double jumping around the environment with stylish abandon. Combat is strong too, made up of accessible combos and easy to implement dodges. Chargeable special attacks are suitably bombastic, laying waste to swarms of foes in blooming patters of blue fire.</p>


<p>Entire sections of the game transform into something akin to a scrolling shoot ‘em up, in which the speed of the player characters’ increase, enemies spawn in greater numbers, and you are encouraged to squeeze the trigger to unleash a delicious spray of machine gun fire, cavalcade of rockets, or a smattering of ninja throwing stars. Thanks to clear horizontal pathways mowed into the ground like the level is a fancy lawn, it’s easy to tell if you are on the same attack plane as your enemy, removing the common frustration of not being able to hit your foe as you are slightly in the wrong position.</p>
<p>It’s all eminently enjoyable silly stuff, particularly in local co-op. The problem comes with how slight the game is, perhaps even being unfinished. For example, early on in the game you’re encouraged to choose between two paths, with the tutorial informing you that this will be a regular occurrence. However, no further path choosing occurs – it’s like the devs ran out of time to actually include the feature. There are also lengthy expanses of level where nothing much happens, you just walk from left to right; no dialogue, no enemies, no nothing. The final two levels also feel rather cheap, one seeing you fight evil versions of yourselves again and again, the other featuring a supremely underwhelming final boss that is an unexpected doddle to defeat.</p>

<p>Upon completion, there’s little reason to return. Sure, you can play through each level to tick off certain challenges, but these activities are exactly the same on each stage. After being forced to shoot every enemy rather than engage in close combat five times in a row, things get pretty boring. In short, there’s a distinct vibe of this not being fully fleshed out.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The debut release from Gylee Games has a lot going for it; a charming cartoony aesthetic and reliably punchy fisticuffs being at the forefront of that particular list. Yet, it also feels too light on content, suggesting we might have to wait for a sequel before Ra Ra Boom’s true potential is realised.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Cronos: The New Dawn – Should You Bring The Bolt Cutter With You?]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-%E2%80%93-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you.1288494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true survival-horror fashion, Cronos: The New Dawn features a few items that The Travel has to acquire to complete the mission. These items like keys and keycards, are discarded automatically once they no longer useful. There's only one exception to this rule: the Bolt Cutter.</p>



<p>Much like the keys above, the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> is an item that is required to proceed toward one of the early game's main objectives, but once it is used to open a door locked with a chain, it isn't discarded like every other progression-related item. As inventory space in Cronos: The New Dawn is limited, bringing an item that may not look particularly useful during the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't sound like a great idea, so <strong>is there any reason why you should bring it with you?</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>There are plenty of good reasons to bring the Bolt Cutter with you in Cronos: The New Dawn</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though some may prefer to carry more useful items as they make their way through New Dawn, <strong>bringing the Bolt Cutter with you may still be a good idea</strong>. Even though there aren't a lot of doors that require the item to open, there's at least one of them in all of the game's main locations, and inside these doors, you will find <strong>a ton of useful resources</strong> that can really make a difference in an experience where resources like ammo and crafting materials are scarce. As such, consider <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">expanding your Shell's inventory slots</a></strong> as much as possible in the early game, not only to always have the Bolt Cutter with you, but also to be able to carry all the items you can find inside the rooms you can access with it.</p>



<p>However, if a bit of backtracking doesn't scare you, you always have the option to leave the Bolt Cutter inside your storage crate and backtrack to retrieve it whenever you find a locked door. Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't make stage navigation too simple without a map, but after spending a few minutes inside any of the game's main locations, you should have decent knowledge of their layouts, making backtracking a little easier.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pragmata-isn%E2%80%99t-a-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom-killing-fans%E2%80%99-dreams.1288491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PRAGMATA was among the most interesting titles shown at Gamescom 2025, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francesco De Meo's preview</a> published earlier today:</p>



<p><em>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun.</em></p>



<p>I also played a bit of the Gamescom 2025 demo and came away equally impressed and looking forward to the release next year. However, just in case you're among the die-hard Mega Man fans who have been speculating that PRAGMATA could somehow be connected to CAPCOM's Mega Man franchise, game producer Naoto Oyama has officially killed your dreams in a statement <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to VideoGamesChronicle</a>:</p>



<p><em>Pragmata is not a Mega Man game. It is a completely new game from Capcom. I was actually one of the producers on the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love Mega Man are passionate about Pragmata too. From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.</em></p>



<p>It always seemed a bit of a stretch to me, but as Oyama said, ultimately it doesn't matter much as long as Mega Man fans can enjoy it all the same. The single player action/adventure game will be released at some point next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X after several delays (PRAGMATA was originally slated for 2022, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, and then again indefinitely until the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 window</a>).</p>

            <p>Mewgenics finally has a release date! The endless cat breeding RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>'s Edmund McMillen will be released on 10th February, 2026 on PC. That's over 13 years since its original announcement!</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, McMillen (one half of the Mewgenics team) released a gameplay reveal on his personal YouTube account. It's a whopping 50-minutes long, and showcases how the much-anticipated indie will actually play. You can check it out yourself down below.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Mewgenics has been on a bizarre development journey. First revealed in 2012 after the smash hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the game was described as the "strangest project" McMillen had ever worked on. However, this version of Mewgenics was shelved and ultimately cancelled, with McMillen focusing on The Legend of Bumbo until 2018 when he acquired the rights for Mewgenics from Team Meat and began development on the game alongside Tyler Glaiel.</p>

<p>So it's been a wild one. Still, it's awesome to see Mewgenics nearly at the finish line. McMillen and Glaiel are well-respected for good reason. Here's to a future full of weird and wonderful cats</p>

<figure><a title="007 / Hitman" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/68598632611c7/007-hitman.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Judging from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-that-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">recent gameplay reveal</a>, IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> is looking pretty marvellous, and it's heading to the Switch 2 on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, in speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-dev-io-interactive-put-daniel-craigs-head-on-agent-47-when-pitching-for-james-bond-game-007-first-light">IGN</a>, game director Hakan Abrak has revealed that IO managed to secure the video game rights to James Bond in a rather amusing (albeit not entirely surprising) way. Essentially, the studio took the (digital) head of Daniel Craig, the most recent actor to portray Bond, and stuck it on Agent 47's body from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3xqozmu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The team then demonstrated how a Bond game would work by exploring the Sapienza level from 2016's Hitman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We actually did put Daniel Craig in there. We just modeled his head and put it in instead of Agent 47, just for demo purposes, giving an impression of what these living, breathing spaces mean in an IO game. And if you are acquainted with the franchise, there is a level called Sapienza with the virus in the caves underneath the compound. So we showed some things off there and, yeah, it was well received.</p>
<p>"I think what they saw in us and what we are also conveying is our angle would be to try to deliver a 360 experience where it's not necessarily about only shooting and cut scenes — there's certainly that in our game as well — but it's also being able to explore the part of the Bond fantasy where he is in social spaces where he is using not only his fisticuffs, but also his charms and bluff and figuring out different ways in those social spaces to overcome the obstacles or get what he wants. How would a charming Bond fare in a situation like this where he doesn't have to necessarily resort to violence?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, we reckon it's safe to say that folks weren't exactly shocked to discover that IO, who really did tremendous work on the Hitman series, would be the ones to bring James Bond back into the world of video games. Hitman is basically Bond, but... maybe a bit more violent. Just a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a fun little story about how that project came to be, and we can't wait to check out the full game next year. 007 First Light will be available via a standard edition priced at <strong>$69.99 / €69.99 / £59.99</strong> along with a deluxe edition priced at <strong>$79.99 / €79.99 / £69.99</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's sci-fi game PRAGMATA has been a mystery for a good while. In the months following its announcement in <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">2020</a> and its eventual delay from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/">2022 release window</a>, very little was said about the game, making players feel it would follow in the footsteps of the ill-fated <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-down-hasnt-been-completely-given-up-on-by-capcom-says-ono/">Deep Down</a>, an action role-playing game by the Japanese publisher that never saw the light of day. Thankfully, that was not to be the case, as a trailer shared in 2023 confirmed it was a real game with some rather unique gameplay mechanics, which were further defined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">subsequent showings</a>. While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</p>



<p>The PRAGMATA Gamescom demo takes place aboard a deserted lunar research facility deep in space, where protagonist Hugh and the android Dana work together to uncover what happened to it and eventually return to Earth safely. On the surface, the game doesn't feel much different from a lot of other third-person action-adventure games, as Hugh has to navigate an intricate enough facility and complete a few simple puzzles, mostly of the navigational kind, while fighting enemies here and there. To be fair, everything feels pleasing enough to play, but the game definitely wouldn't have been very remarkable without its unique combat system combining action and puzzle game elements, which is sure to become the defining highlight of the entire experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>PRAGMATA's hacking mechanics add a new dimension to traditional third-person action combat that makes the game extremely fun to play.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Hugh can damage any enemy using any weapon, Dana will first have to hack them to lower their defenses. Hacking is done via some puzzle grids that are generally easy to complete, but that can be a challenge to clear with the attention divided between the minigame and avoiding damage. Once the puzzle has been completed, the enemy will be left defenseless for a short while, allowing Hugh to dispose of it. The hacking minigames promise to become more complex as Hugh discovers new abilities, as it is possible to apply debuffs via some slightly more complex puzzle grids. At the beginning of the demo, handling the two core elements of the combat system felt a little forced, but before long, I was hacking and taking down enemies with ease, all the while having extreme fun. The boss fight possibly even did a better job showcasing just how nicely this gameplay setup works, making for an intense battle that felt extremely dynamic with the constant switching between hacking and action gameplay, and properly taking advantage of the enemy's vulnerable state to maximize damage.</p>



<p>Having had so much fun with the demo, my time with PRAGMATA flew by way too quickly, leaving me hungering for more. With hints of things to come already noticeable from the demo, I really cannot wait to see how creative the development team got with an experience that is set to be among the most fun in action-adventure games in years. Sadly, we still don't know when we will be able to embark on this journey together with Hugh and Dana, as PRAGMATA is slated for a generic 2026 release window on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. What we do know, however, is that <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is not a 'secret Mega Man game'</a> after all.</p>
