YouTube joins the slowly growing list of companies with gaming initiatives, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">rolling out its Playables</a> program across mobile and desktop. To play, simply visit YouTube’s website or Android / iOS app and look for Playables in the sidebar. YouTube will let players save their progress and keep track of high scores. There are over 75 games to choose from, including chess and crossword games to more popular casual mobile titles like <em>Angry Birds Showdown!</em>, <em>Trivia Crack</em>, and <em>Cut the Rope</em>.</p><p>YouTube began its foray into gaming last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978515/youtube-playables-games-premium-subscribers">offering Playables to YouTube Premium subscribers</a>. That initial phase had far fewer games and was only around for a relatively limited amount of time, with the phase wrapping up in March of this year.</p><p>Offering a slate of casual games has become one of the more popular ways that tech companies are using to lure in or keep subscribers. LinkedIn recently rolled out its game offerings that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">apparently pretty entertaining</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23738694/new-york-times-crosswords-games-app-wordle-spelling-bee"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">Netflix</a> have all added games as a part of their regular services. Even YouTube’s parent company, Google, tried its hand at gaming in 2019 with the Google Stadia cloud gaming subscription service. After a little more than three years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">Google shut Stadia down in 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-new-studio-partnering-xbox-new-aaa-unreal-engine-5-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fans of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/batman-arkham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman: Arkham series</a> have not exactly been in a great place following the release of Rocksteady Studios’ severely disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, but there may be a sliver of hope for those wishing the spirit of the Arkham games would live on. Last year, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-suicide-squad-dev-rockstead-loses-founders-sefton-hill-jamie-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker had left the company</a>. Hill served as director for all three Arkham Trilogy games and Jamie Walker was Rocksteady’s studio director, so they weren’t just a pair of suits, but rather the main creative force at the developer. Well, now we may know a bit more about what Hill and Walker are working on post-Rocksteady.</p>
<p>Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have founded the new London-based studio <a href="https://www.hundredstar.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundred Star Games</a>, which already has around 100 employees. <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/hundred-star-xbox-aaa-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According a report from eXputer</a>, Xbox is funding Hundred Star Games’ first project, which will be a “AAA, single-player, action-adventure game” built with Unreal Engine 5. The eXputer report says the game is “likely” to be exclusive to the Xbox ecosystem, but, of course, it’s no longer a lock that Microsoft footing the bill for a game means it will be exclusive as games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-april-release-date-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and (reportedly) the <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next entry in the Doom series</a> go multiplatform.</p>
<p>According to eXputer, around 20 percent of Hundred Stars’ current staff come from Rocksteady. Beyond that, we don’t have a ton of info about the studio past this official description…</p>
<p><em>“Hundred Star Games is a video game start-up based in East London. Our ethos is of creating a small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide. With innovation at our core, we're dedicated to pushing boundaries, embracing diversity, and fostering a vibrant gaming community. Our empowering company culture is unique to the industry which encourages leadership at all levels, accountability, team support, vulnerability, and connection.”</em></p>
<p>The masterminds behind the Batman: Arkham series getting back to developing a more straightforward single-player adventure certainly sounds promising. Then again, Hill and Walker oversaw the majority of Suicide Squad’s doomed development, so let’s hope that was just a one-time stumble. What do you think? Excited to see what they might be cooking up?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uvalde-parents-and-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision.883161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="eElKbU">Families of victims killed and injured in an Uvalde, Texas school shooting are suing Meta and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> publisher Activision Blizzard for promoting guns to kids. “[Activision is] chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters,” attorney Katherine Mesner-Hage <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F736998045%2FActivision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24166245%2Fuvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23930286__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23930286__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">wrote in the complaint</a> filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p id="y5AZI9">Activision is being targeted as an alleged “training camp for mass shooters,” while attorneys call out Meta and Instagram as “the firearm industry’s best advertiser.” The Uvalde victims and their families are also suing Daniel Defense, whose AR-15 style rifle was used by 17-year-old Salvador Ramos to kill 21 people and injure 17 others at Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/24/uvalde-shooting-lawsuits-gunmaker-instagram-texas/">in a separate lawsuit also filed Friday</a>. Daniel Defense’s DDM4v7 rifle, which the Uvalde victims’ lawyer called “an upscale version of the AR-15,” was highlighted on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>’s opening title page while also being promoted on Instagram by Daniel Defense. Ramos purchased that weapon minutes after his 18th birthday, which was eight days before the shooting at Robb Elementary School.</p>
<p id="BIZA6d">The lawyer wrote that Ramos was not a casual Call of Duty player, saying he “played obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewards” in the game that required him to “grind for hours on end.” Before downloading <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> in 2021, he played several other versions of the game, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>. Mesner-Hage alleges that Ramos was introduced to the DDM4v7 rifle simultaneously through Call of Duty and on Instagram. Ramos also allegedly searched for other accessories inspired by video games — “a Red Dot Sight, a smoke grenade, an AR-15 weapon skin, and an EOTech holographic battle sight.”</p>
<p id="prUiP2">The lawsuit also included several gruesome details of the attack, including that Ramos approached a teacher and said “good night,” before shooting her in the head — something Mesner-Hage said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b93j9sBZ1A">is something longtime Call of Duty character Captain Price is known to say in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em></a> and other games.</p>
<p id="4P2hQh">“There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.  Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent,” attorney Josh Koskoff wrote in a news release. “Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.”</p>
<p id="dI6Y4l">An Activision spokesperson told Polygon that academic and scientific research shows “no causal link” between video games and violence. “The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence,” the spokesperson said. “Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.”</p>
<p id="kzgDVZ">But the Uvalde victims’ lawyers disagree, pointing to the evolving realism of Call of Duty’s weapons as a marketing tool for gun manufacturers. They also referenced at least five other mass shootings in which Call of Duty was allegedly linked to shooters, one of which was a shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. After that shooting, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798498/walmart-violent-video-games-movies-store-displays-shooting-el-paso">Walmart instructed its employees to remove signage</a> referencing violent video games and hunting from its store, but did not stop selling guns. </p>
<p id="uONIoj">Indeed, researchers haven’t found a causal link between playing video games and gun violence; the Stanford Brainstorm Lab spent months reviewing all scholarship related to the topic, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">according to Fortune</a>. There was some link to vaguely described “aggression,” which encompassed a range of actions. These studies still didn’t find a causal link between games and violence, the researchers wrote. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers">Certain video game communities</a> <em>have</em>, however, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15554120231167214">been linked to right-wing extremism in the United States</a>.</p>
<p id="c4nYIM">It’s true, too, that video games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3938148/video-games-fund-gun-manufacturers">have licensed weapon likenesses</a> for video games; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/8/4311346/ea-will-no-longer-pay-for-rights-to-use-real-guns-in-video-games">Electronic Arts dropped the practice in 2013</a>, for instance, but still uses the same types of guns — just without the names. “It is hard to qualify to what extent rifle sales have increased as a result of being in games,” Ralph Vaughn of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, whose M82 sniper rifle has appeared in Call of Duty games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">told Eurogamer in 2013</a>. “But video games expose our brand to a young audience who are considered possible future owners.” </p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 4, dubbed Loot Reborn, has overhauled the loot system. This includes a new way to power up your gear in the endgame of Diablo 4 via the new Masterworking system. Masterworking improves the bonuses of every affix an item has, increasing how powerful your build can be. However, getting the materials to masterwork gear requires some grinding.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Masterworking</h2><p dir="ltr">You can masterwork Gear at the blacksmith, but only after unlocking The Pit, a new endgame dungeon, which is the only way to get Masterwork materials. To unlock The Pit, you must first beat a Tier 46 Nightmare Dungeon, which requires you to be on World Tier 4 and features level 100 enemies. The Pit starts at Tier 1, with level 100 enemies, and goes all the way up to Tier 200. To enter The Pit, you need 3 Runeshards, which drop from Whisper Caches, Helltide chests, Legion chests, Nightmare Dungeons, and World Bosses. Once you unlock The Pit, you will need to complete one run to unlock the masterwork menu at the blacksmith.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Masterworking works</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309280"></a><figcaption>Each masterwork rank requires three different materials and a bunch of gold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg"></figure><p>Each item can be masterworked a total of 12 times, with most ranks adding a 5% boost to every Affix an item has. However, ranks 4, 8, and 12 each add a boost of 25% to a single affix at random. Only items that are either Ancestral Legendary with two Tempered Affixes or Ancestral Uniques can be upgraded via masterworking.</p><p dir="ltr">Depending on the type of item, you will need some basic crafting materials, like Veiled Crystal or Forgotten Soul, Gold, and one of the three Pit materials, depending on which upgrade rank you are on.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranks 1 through 4 require Obducite, 5 through 8 require Ingolith, and 9 through 12 require Neathiron. Obducite is dropped from Tiers 1 to 29 in The Pit, Ingolith Tiers 30 to 59, and Neathiron 60 to 200. <strong>You can transmute the higher tier materials into the lower tier versions at the Alchemist, but you can't turn the lower tier materials into the higher tier</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Pit itself is relatively simple. Each run has a 15-minute time limit to hit mastery, ending with a significant amount of that tier's crafting material. Dying in The Pit takes time off the clock, with the first death taking 30 seconds, the second taking 60 seconds, and the third death and every death after taking 90 seconds. To complete The Pit, you need to quickly kill enemies to fill up a meter. Once the meter is filled, a portal takes you to the boss fight. The boss fight is similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-nightmare-dungeons-nightmare-sigils-guide/1100-6514817/">Nightmare Dungeon</a> boss fights, except a shadow of a random enemy also appears in the arena, firing off attacks during the fight. Completing a tier will unlock the next tier, but if you complete it fast, you can unlock up to three tiers in a single run.</p><p dir="ltr">If you run a higher tier with a party than you have unlocked, you will unlock the tiers after that tier, but not before it. For example, if your highest tier is 35 and you run a 45 with a friend, you will unlock tier 46, but not tier 36.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309281"></a><figcaption>You can reset items if you are unhappy with your masterwork rolls, but you won't get any of your materials back.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to note that upgrading gear takes a decent amount of materials, especially if you don't get the rolls on the 25% bonuses you want. <strong>You can reset an item's masterwork ranks back to zero at any point, but it costs money and materials to do so. You also do not get your masterworking materials refunded, so make sure you really want to reset it</strong>. You can salvage masterworked items to get some of The Pit materials back, but you will only get a fraction.</p>

It also suggests new twists in the story of the expansion: the temptation of one of Destiny's most notable characters, Commander Zavala.</p><p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 players have known that the Witness, the antagonist operating from the shadows for the last 10 years of the Destiny Light and Darkness Saga, has designs to end the world, but the story trailer finally shows us what that might look like. The "Final Shape" the Witness wants to bring about is a reshaping of reality that locks the universe into a perfect stillness, which the Witness believes will bring an end to all suffering. In practice, that means turning everyone and everything into taxidermy-like statues, and when the trailer shows that applied to the people of Earth, it hits pretty hard.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the trailer yourself below. It includes the reunion of Cayde-6, who was killed in the Forsaken expansion but has returned in The Final Shape for reasons even he doesn't understand, with his buds Zavala and Ikora. It seems like Destiny 2's major characters will see a fair amount of action in The Final Shape, too; the trailer suggests a similar number of story cutscenes to what Bungie put in Destiny 2's vanilla campaign.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Most notable, though, is where the story seems to be headed, with the trailer teasing that Commander Zavala might be tempted by the Darkness. If you've been following the story for the last few years, that makes a lot of sense. Zavala has been struggling with a crisis of faith for <em>a while</em> now, especially after the events of The Witch Queen expansion when the Hive, a group of genocidal aliens and basically humanity's greatest enemies, were gifted with the same physics-breaking superpowers, the Light, as Zavala and the rest of us Guardians.</p><p dir="ltr">Zavala has seemed like he's been having a hard time for the last few years, and after the Lightfall campaign, one of his close friends and lieutenants, Amanda Holliday, was killed. That loss hit him <em>very</em> hard, and you can see early in the trailer that Zavala is wearing Amanda's scarf tied around his arm. So when the Witness suggests that maybe Zavala might get everything he wants if he helps enact the Final Shape, there are some good reasons why Zavala might consider the offer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the trailer is among the first times we're hearing actor Keith David in the role of Zavala, who he plays throughout The Final Shape. David is taking over the role from Lance Reddick, who'd played Zavala since 2014 and was a regular Destiny 2 player himself, died in 2023. </p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape launches on June 4, so we'll have to wait until then to see how things shake out. In the meantime, check out our previews of The Final Shape, including a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-final-shape-brings-new-depth-to-its-missions-and-defragmented-world/1100-6523728/" data-ref-id="1100-6523728">the new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler, and the expansions story campaign</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-prismatic-subclass-avoids-the-mistakes-of-strand-in-lightfall/1100-6523730/" data-ref-id="1100-6523730">its new Prismatic subclass</a>.</p>

It's used to describe long overtime and has been a common practice in the industry for decades--though also heavily debated and polarizing.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke touched on the touchy subject recently at the Digital Dragons conference in Poland, per <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.

<p dir="ltr">"We didn't overly crunch [on Baldur's Gate 3], but we did have to do a bit of crunch," Vincke said. "And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean Vincke and Larian just accept crunch as standard. Vincke, who directed Baldur's Gate 3, said there was less crunch making the RPG compared to previous games the studio has worked on. It became necessary with Baldur's Gate 3 because "we had things happen that we didn't foresee," according to Vincke.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-studio-says-its-next-two-games-could-be-its-best-work-ever/1100-6522782/" data-ref-id="1100-6522782">Larian is working on its next two games that could be its "best work ever."</a> Neither will be Baldur's Gate 4, as the company leaves the world of the Forgotten Realms to create its own properties.

Let’s take a look at what are the tasks and their conditions, and if you should complete it at all. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-90-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 90+ TOTS Player Pick SBC Tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">The latest version of the TOTS SBC is pretty similar to last week’s release. There are two tasks – 85-rated squad and 87-rated squad. </p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, you’ll only need one TOTS/TOTW item to complete this SBC. It’s best to complete the 83+ TOTW Pick SBC in case someone doesn’t have a Team of the Week item. As an alternative, using a duplicate TOTS card can be a good idea. </p>

			<p>Today, Bungie has released the official launch trailer for Destiny 2: The Final Shape, out on June 4. This will be the eighth expansion produced for the free-to-play first-person shooter MMO game released in 2017.</p>
<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-detailed-for-february-2024-launch-season-of-the-witch-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch in February 2024</a>. However, Bungie endured some rough times, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering layoffs</a> and leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-june-additional-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion's delay until June</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a sixth Prismatic subclass that will combine both the powers of Light and Darkness, allowing players to mix and match abilities and supers from the other five subclasses (Void, Solar, Arc, Stasis, and Strand). The Prismatic subclass introduces two meters that fill up as players damage and defeat enemies with either Light or Darkness abilities; when both meters are fully charged, players can activate a super-like ability called Transcendence, which grants supercharged melee and grenade regeneration, increased damage resistance, and increased weapon damage.</p>
<p>Players can also unleash unique grenades of combined elements depending on their class while Transcendence is active-Electrified Snare (Arc and Strand) for Titans, Freezing Singularity (Void and Stasis) for Warlocks, and Hailfire Spike (Solar and Stasis) for Hunters. Prismatics will also have more Aspect and Fragment slots than the other subclasses.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape will also inaugurate a new content delivery model through episodes. The first episode, Echoes, will start on June 11, one week after the expansion's release. New and existing players' Power levels will be increased to the new minimum Power level of 1900, a soft cap of 1940, with the hard power level cap set at 1990, and the Pinnacle Reward cap at 2000. These power level increases will take effect upon the release of The Final Shape itself on June 4.</p>
<p>This episode's story will focus on the Vex and take place shortly after the events of The Final Shape and its raid. Revenant, the second episode of Destiny 2: The Final Shape, is tentatively scheduled to launch in October 2024 and will focus on the Scorn. Heresy, the third episode, is tentatively slated to release in February 2025 and will focus on the Hive.</p>

<p>In other Bungie news, a jury <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just awarded the studio $63K</a> following a lawsuit against Destiny 2 cheat maker AimJunkies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-never-been-a-better-time-to-delve-into-deep-rock-galactic.883128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166283/deep-rock-galactic-season-five-updates-franchise-survivor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RaU7fC">In the years since the rampant success of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/22/18097804/left-4-dead-10th-anniversary-legacy">back in 2008</a>, we’ve seen many solid co-op horde shooters. Few of these games have garnered as loyal a community as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074194/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-impressions"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>, a dwarven twist on the familiar four-player formula that came out a decade after <em>L4D</em>. Not only is <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> still in a strong place, with season 5 set to debut in June, but the franchise has also expanded into successful spin-off titles. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24073651/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-beginner-tips-tricks"><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em></a> is an auto-shooter in the vein of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22927447/vampire-survivors-review-roguelike-bullet-hell-steam-pc-browser-8-bit-characters-power-ups"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, and Ghost Ship Games has announced a roguelike called <em>Deep Rock Survivor: Rogue Core.</em> It’s a great time — maybe even the <em>best </em>time — to get into all things Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
<p id="Igzfpq">The original game is about a space corporation called Deep Rock Galactic with lax safety regulations and a voracious thirst for profit. The corporation sends teams of dwarves to alien planets, and those teams must excavate valuable resources while being assailed by endless hordes of bugs and beasties. There are four classes: Scout, Engineer, Driller, and Gunner. Each class has its own abilities — for instance, the Engineer can create new platforms, the Scout can use a grappling hook to reach high locations, the Driller tears through terrain and creates new tunnels, and the Gunner is especially proficient at bug murder.</p>
<div id="J8YOEg"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/922YV_0T6CY?rel=0&amp;start=6699" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RnMkWk">Season 5 will come with a few new fun additions, which I tested during a play session with Ghost Ship Games. The new mission type is called Deep Scan, and it sends dwarves searching for Morkite Geodes deep within the mines of Hoxxes. Once the team has triangulated a position, they can call in an enormous Drillevator, a portmanteau that explains the function of the tool wonderfully. It’s fun to have horde shooter mechanics applied to vertical spaces, and it’s thrilling to plummet down through the core of the planet, occasionally halting and allowing waves of furious bugs to catch up. Once the dwarves reach their destination and collect valuable Morkite seeds, the corporation is generous enough to gift them with some Jet Boots, which allows them to rocket up into the air with minimal risk of injury or death.</p>
<p id="cGZ7wR">There will be a new season event involving Core Stores, which are giant, dark, crystalline-like structures that glow with a menacing purple energy — but are extremely valuable to our higher-ups back at the corporation. The new season also adds Overclocks, a modifier that dramatically upgrades certain functions of a dwarf’s base weapons.</p>
<p id="yN8Dfc">For those who haven’t caught the past seasons of <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, in season 5 Ghost Ship Games is adding the ability to select any season and play through it at your leisure. This includes the old season rewards and cosmetics, as well as any conditions or complications from that season’s story. It’s similar to <em>World of Warcraft: Classic</em>, in that it allows players to sample past offerings without any FOMO.</p>
<p id="oBtIAY">Players can expect more from the larger world of Deep Rock Galactic in 2025, when Ghost Ship Games launches <em>Rogue Core</em> into early access. After <em>Rogue Core</em>, Ghost Ship Games intends to release Season 6 of <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>. Of course, there’s a wealth of content to dig into already — especially if you’ve never given <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> a shot. Auto-shooter spin-off <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> has also <a href="https://x.com/FundayGamesdk/status/1768635634241954204">sold over a million copies</a>, which suggests the franchise has legs. This new season is the best chance to jump aboard the base game and dig into everything the horde shooter has to offer. </p>

The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.</p>

<p>First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wapN3UqjJmI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Lidia follows on the heels of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released">Eddy Gordo </a>as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-the-mad-max-movies-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-the-mad-max-movies-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="173" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since 1979, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/">George Miller’s <em>Mad Max </em>series</a> has transformed from a schlocky B-rate post-apocalypse story to one of the most beloved action franchises of all time.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true"><em>Mad Max </em>is set in Australia sometime after the world has been desolated by plagues, economic collapse, and ecological die out. The dregs of humanity hang onto life and go to war over the remaining food, fuel, and shelter. The humans in <em>Mad Max </em>also spend a good chunk of their time creating spike-covered vehicles that can patrol the wastes and duke it out in high speed battles. It’s a goofy premise that takes itself entirely too seriously, but that’s part of the appeal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">The <em>Mad Max </em>movies are beloved for good reason, but even super fans like myself have to admit that some of them are quite a bit better than others. They might not all be worth a rewatch, but they’re definitely worth ranking.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors </figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-mad-max-beyond-thunderdome" data-injectable="false">Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><em>Beyond Thunderdome </em>is arguably the most iconic <em>Mad Max </em>movie thanks to the titular combat arena and a truly memorable performance from Tina Turner. At the same time, this movie is a lot worse than your memory might lead you to believe. There’s less time spent watching post-apocalyptic gladiators duke it out than there is watching Max interact with a group of semi-feral children. Digging into various factions and the plight of kids in the wasteland definitely gives <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em> a different feel than the other movies, but that’s not really to its benefit.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max</h2> <p data-characters="589" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Mad Max</em> still holds up, but I’d be lying if I said that nostalgia had nothing to do with this ranking. Truly an example of low-budget filmmaking at its finest, <em>Mad Max</em> is about as stripped down as you can get. We learn about Max’s origins as a sort of police officer in an apocalypse-lite society (the world doesn’t become completely desolate until the sequel). The gang leader Toecutter is still the most memorable villain of the series, and the stunt performers who absolutely risked their lives while filming deserve much of the credit for making <em>Mad Max</em> so good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">In some ways, <em>Furiosa </em>is more like <em>Beyond Thunderdome </em>than any other <em>Mad Max </em>movie. <em>Furiosa</em> tells a grandiose story set over more than a decade, and it spends lots of time building up various factions and locations in the wasteland, which is why you should probably <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/">catch up on the series before watching it</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">That said, the stories it weaves together are much more interesting than the ones presented in <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em>, and the action scenes that link all the brooding and worldbuilding moments together are top-notch. <em>Furiosa </em>doesn’t provide quite the same thrill ride as other movies in the series, but it definitely tells the most cohesive story and gives us a clear vision of the wasteland that the other movies don’t really explore.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors </figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max: The Road Warrior</h2> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">It <em>almost</em> doesn’t get better than <em>The Road Warrior</em>. The sequel to the original <em>Mad Max</em> opens up the world and brings the apocalypse to the forefront of the story. There aren’t cops any more, just roving bands of car-obsessed raiders and the people who desperately try to avoid them. <em>The Road Warrior </em>ups the ante on all the action shown off in the first film and truly sets the tone for the rest of the series. Some of the storytelling is a bit clumsy, and there’s the Mel Gibson of it all to get past, but <em>The Road Warrior </em>still stands out as the best of the original <em>Mad Max </em>trilogy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max: Fury Road</h2> <p data-characters="600" data-current-count="900" data-injectable="false">It feels a little weird to put a legacy sequel at the top of this list, but it’s also hard to deny that <em>Fury Road</em> is a masterpiece. The movie basically functions as one giant chase scene, and it manages to capture everything that makes the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise great. From beginning to end, it’s packed with clever world building details, breathtaking shots, and some of the most well-choreographed action scenes ever put to film. Everything the earlier movies did well, <em>Fury Road</em> does better, so if someone was only ever going to watch a single entry in the series, this is the one I’d recommend.</p>

<p data-characters="182" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em>. It’s a highly beginner-friendly challenge available in Ultimate Team, with solo options to complete for tasks. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Albert Gudmundsson was in terrific form in the recently-concluded Serie A season, and EA Sports has released the card to celebrate his performance. This is certainly one of the cheapest TOTS SBC that you can complete. If you’re a beginner, this can be an excellent way to reinforce your Ultimate Team squad. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-albert-gudmundsson-serie-a-tots-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC Tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">As mentioned earlier, the solo task makes this challenge very easy to finish for beginners. Do note that the task has certain specified conditions that are required to be fulfilled to get the TOTS card. </p>
 <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="33" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Albert Gudmundsson</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM</li> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min. Team Rating: 84</li> </ul> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">While the overall rating of the squad has to be 84, you’ll have to use at least one TOTS or TOTW card. You can complete the 83+ TOTW Pick to get a Team of the Week card while saving coins. </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EA-FC-24-Gudmundsson-TOTS.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;2304&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1024&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>

If you want to complete tonight’s challenge, make sure to use saved fodder. Far more expensive SBCs, like the Trinity Rodman TOTS challenge, are expected next week. </p> <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Albert Gudmundsson</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"> <li>Thiago Alcantara 84</li> <li>Stanislav Lobotka 84</li> <li>Memphis Depay 84</li> <li>Thomas Muller 84</li> <li>Ismael Bennacer 84</li> <li>Casey Stanway 84</li> <li>Serge Gnabry 84</li> <li>Griedge Mbock 84</li> <li>Alan Varela TOTW 84</li> <li>Luis Alberto 84</li> <li>Franco Acerbi 83</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">The Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC features a 94-rated ST item, and the card boasts of 99 Pace. Speed won’t be an issue at all, but both Shooting (92) and Passing (88) can do with a bit of boost. The 4* Skills and 4* Weak Foot could also be hard to manage at this stage of the game. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="false">Nevertheless, this SBC certainly is well-worth its price. Those who have tight budgets could also look to complete the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SB</a>C, which probably has one of the best returns in terms of offered value. </p>

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With a week left until players can wrap up the Light and Dark saga in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em>, Bungie has dropped the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ">launch trailer for <em>The Final Shape</em></a>. It’s two minutes and 21 seconds of imagery that has me cautiously optimistic, and also unsettled by how many questions it has me asking.</p> <h2 id="h-witness-me-i-scream-for-the-50th-time" data-injectable="false">“Witness me!” I scream for the 50th time</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The trailer begins with what a lot of players have been begging for, seeing Guardians interact with the Last City’s general populace. A boy stares in awe at a Warlock and their Ghost as they pass by, and we get a real sense that Guardians are these larger-than-life heroes. </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">An Eliksni is busking with an acoustic guitar in the same market, simultaneously strumming and tapping out a beat with its four arms. Could they be the ideal species capable of reproducing the magic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46qjDJ0lLdE">Steve Vai’s performances</a>?</p>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">The boy picks up an apple from an Awoken vendor before looking to the sky with the crowd as the Witness launches its campaign of terror on children and fruit. Piece by piece, The Last City is frozen in place, with its inhabitants twisted into macabre perversions of their original visage.</p> <figure data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">From there, we get a hodgepodge sequence of the Vanguard already inside the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/">Pale Heart of the Traveler</a> and journeying into it. Time seems out of sorts, as Crow stands in the twilight of The Last City with the Traveler above it, and a Ghost flickers between states of life and death. Zavala’s pauldron is consumed by something not unlike the Venom symbiote, while the Ace of Spades lies broken in a patch of dead grass.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">There is a lot of emphasis on Zavala throughout the entire trailer. Before entering the Traveler, we see the Titan staring fondly at a piece of fabric woven into his pauldron that appears to be Amanda Holliday’s scarf. His attention is caught by a mirror held by what, oh holy cow, is that the Winnower!? I wasn’t sure she was actually real!</p> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">“The Winnower” is the name given to the veiled figure found in many of the Pyramid ships, who the community thought would be the big bad before the Witness popped up. The Winnower was then thought to be more of a metaphor for the Witness, shaping and cutting back the growth of the Traveler’s “garden.” Yet, here we are, seeing her signaling Zavala with a mirror.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">From there, Zavala is seen with Ikora Rey and Cayde-6, reaching into a doorway filled with that same inky mass. Visions of Safiyah cast in stone flash rapidly between shots of the Commander’s gauntleted hand reaching out to her. This, combined with Ikora and the Witness speaking to him, hints the Witness is preying on Zavala’s profound grief and is trying to recruit him.</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">This is furthered by a shot of the Witness standing before the Veil with an outstretched hand toward Zavala. Behind the Vanguard leader is a sea of Winnowers who begin collapsing into dust. Big Blue stands solemnly before several hands reach out from the darkness to grab his face and pull him in.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Taking a break from Zavala, the trailer jumps to the resurrected Cayde-6 looking over his dead body from the beginning of <em>Forsaken</em>. The last we saw of the former Hunter Vanguard, he had ambushed Crow, who had just infiltrated the Traveler. Cayde will likely have to deal with his death and resurrection while also processing the whirlwind of emotions we all did as Prince Uldren Sov was resurrected as Crow.</p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">There are several shots of a cloud of Darkness chasing Ikora, Cayde, and Crow, with big ol’ Witness hands reaching out for them like it’s the final level in <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Speaking of hands, it’s all-hands-on-deck in terms of bad guys, with several shots of the Scorn and Vex joining the fray.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Ikora takes a nasty shot to the shoulder before a combined fleet of Vanguard, Eliksni, and Cabal ships begin transmatting Guardians in. Then, the Warlock Vanguard reminds us of the immense power she wields before the trailer cuts to the title. I’m hoping this means we’ll get a sequence like the beginning of <em>Shadowkeep</em>, but even more amped up.</p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Every time I think I have a handle on the scope of <em>The Final Shape</em>, Bungie shows off a series of snippets that have my mind racing with questions. It’s been said in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8Rou7bKqgc">previous ViDocs</a> that the development team is pulling out all the stops, and I want to believe them. Here’s hoping <em>The Final Shape</em> answers more questions than it asks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/runescape-jagex-engine-sound-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the latest instalment of <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our feature series 'What I Do'</a>, where individuals in and around the video game industry tell us what, exactly, they do for a living.</p><p>The purpose of this feature is two-fold. First, <a href="https://aftermath.site/pokemon-lawyer-cease-desist-fan-project-pikachu-movie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we saw with Pokémon's former chief lawyer</a>, individuals have interesting stories to tell! And secondly, it's my hope that by showing this business is made up of specific people with specific (and often wildly different) jobs, it can help dispel the idea that everyone is just a "dev". Video games are more complicated (and interesting) than that!</p><p>Today's interview is with Chris Knowles. Chris has done a lot of stuff over the last 17 years, but we're going to be devoting a lot of this feature to his time at Jagex, where he worked as an engine and backend developer on games like <em>Runescape</em>.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett</strong>: <em>Chris, hello, thanks for stopping by! Would you mind telling Aftermath's readers a little bit about yourself?</em></p><div><p><strong>Chris Knowles</strong>: I'm Chris, I'm from the UK, and these days I'm an indie game developer. I'm mostly solo, but I've hired freelancers here and there so that I'm not limited to stickmen for art and out-of-tune humming for audio. I ended up in the games industry by a roundabout route - after graduating with an engineering degree I worked for my church for a year, but full-time Christian ministry wasn't for me so I started looking for software jobs. Jagex hired me, but not for games. I spent about 18 months working on things like billing software before I landed an internal move into a games job.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1248420/Hexahedra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Right now I've almost finished <em>Hexahedra</em>, which will be my first indie release, and it's out now</a>! That's exhilarating but also a bit scary. It's an open-ended puzzle game set in a cube factory. You're not looking for the single right answer to each puzzle, instead the game hands you loads of tools and lets you tackle the problem however you want. You need to turn THIS into THAT, and you need to build and program the factory to produce the correct cubes. You then get to see how your solution compares with others across the world. If you're lamenting the closure of Zachtronics, I think <em>Hexahedra </em>will scratch that itch for you.&nbsp;</p></div><p>It also features a tiny octopus called Octavius who's having a nightmare family visit and needs your help. My wife crocheted him and he sits on my desk and keeps me company during the day and occasionally appears on stream (I stream my dev work to help keep me focused), and over time she's made him a variety of hats to wear. He's so cute I decided to get him into the game in digital form.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Neat! By the way,</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1248420/Hexahedra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> you can check out </em>Hexahedra<em> here</em></a><em>. Going back to Jagex though, can you tell us about your time there? What were the actual job titles you held while you were there, and what did an average day look like?</em></p><div><p><strong>CK</strong>:&nbsp; I started out there in 2007 on the team that was responsible for all the software that wasn't a game. Stuff like account creation, custom software for the player support team, and lots of billing stuff, which is where I ended up spending most of my time. After about 18 months I applied to join FunOrb, which was a web-based minigames portal Jagex had built. It was a bit like Miniclip, but with in-house titles. I worked on a big update to a <em>Risk</em>-in-space game called <em>Shattered Plans</em>. This felt quite like being an indie does now - I was responsible for all areas of the game, though I could call on artists and the audio team for support. Oh, and I actually had someone else to do QA! Testing your own stuff is hard!</p><p>After that I worked on a game called <em>8Realms</em>, which launched but wasn't successful at all and shut down pretty quickly. I survived a round of redundancies and at that point I got to work on <em>RuneScape </em>itself. I spent about 7 years working on the <em>RS</em> engine in various forms. The work was really all about supporting the Content teams to make fun things for the players to do - players aren't actually paying for all the cool features in the engine, they're paying for the content that's been built with that engine.</p><p>What I actually worked on, though, varied a lot. You've got the game's client and servers, which need to talk to each other, with the server being the final authority on what happens. There are the login servers that hold everyone's save data, which gets transmitted to a game server when you log in (<em>RS</em> is an unusual MMO because your account isn't locked to a particular game world). The Grand Exchange is a cross-world auction house. There's also a whole raft of support systems that need to be integrated. The billing system lets you tell if someone is a member or a free player, and how much in-game currency they have. The offence system controls whether players are muted or banned. Lots of these systems are managed by other teams, but maintaining the link between them takes work on both sides.</p></div><figure><blockquote><p>The game client we got off the backup...was almost all in one file called client.java that was 12,143 lines long. </p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Is there anything specific that you worked on that you can tell us about?</em></p><div><p><strong>CK</strong>: I did a few bigger projects on the game client. I gave <em>RuneScape</em> 32-bit sound (vital once voice acting arrived), I implemented a new camera system that helped with things like cutscenes, I got the world map rendering on the GPU instead of the CPU. With any software, but particularly something with as many moving parts as <em>RuneScape</em>, the challenge isn't just to add a new feature, but also to insert it into the existing system without breaking anything else. In a well-designed, modular system this is fairly straightforward, and the newer versions of <em>RuneScape</em> have improved a lot, but when <em>Old School RuneScape</em> came along, which was a reboot of the game from a 2007 backup tape, we were using an old codebase without all the fixes and improvements. The game client we got off the backup, apart from code in libraries shared with the server, was almost all in one file called client.java that was 12,143 lines long. It was tightly-coupled and hard to modify. There was a really good reason for it, because that was what it took to get a software-rendered 3D game running in Java in a browser in the days when JVMs were very slow, but it did make development tough until we'd modernized it a bit.</p><p>&nbsp;When a request for a new feature came in from the Content teams, the first thing we would do would be a bit of research to work out how long it would take. This would depend on the size of the feature itself (which doesn't necessarily bear much resemblance to how long it takes to describe what you want!), and how complicated it would be to integrate it into the existing game. Once we'd got an estimate, it was down to the Content folks to decide on its priority. If they wanted us to get someone to spend three months working on a feature, we could do that, but they might well decide they'd rather have a few quicker things that would be more valuable overall. We'd also suggest things we thought would be valuable (at one point they were trying to implement random dungeon generation using <em>RuneScape's </em>scripting language, but we could do it much more easily and efficiently in the engine itself), and there'd be the odd bit of maintenance work we'd have to do, like working with the sysadmins when it came to upgrading physical servers and moving game worlds around.</p><p>&nbsp;Actually making a change means first getting up to speed on how the current system works. You can then plan out how you want to introduce changes without breaking anything. You'd create a branch of the engine code in Git, and if necessary your own content stream in Perforce, so you have your own stable codebase to work on, and start making changes. We were able to run the bare minimum set of systems on our own PCs so we could test changes locally - an<em> RS</em> game server, the client, a fake login server that bypassed the account creation process. This meant we could test our changes locally before sending them off to QA. There was a specialized build system and world rental manager for that. You'd submit your code and run a build, which would create a version of the engine (client and server) available for anyone to use. QA would boot up a world that used that version of the engine, and a specific Perforce stream if they needed a particular bit of test content to go with it. If they found any problems they'd report them, you'd fix them, and then you'd go round the loop again. Once the feature passed QA, it would be logged in the project management software as being ready for launch, and the next time we made a new engine build for release your branch would be integrated into the main version and would go live.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>RuneScape </em>gets updated weekly, but unless there are engine changes the Content teams manage that themselves. With an engine update we'd need to prepare that for them, both a new server version and a new client version, and get it passed through a final round of testing (all those updates might work fine individually, but bringing them all together might cause issues). They could then deploy the new engine alongside the content update.</p><p>&nbsp;Once it was clear that the model of running a game in a browser Java applet was on the way out, I helped to reimplement the entire client in JavaScript and HTML5. I don't recommend writing games in JavaScript. I don't recommend writing ANYTHING in JavaScript. Still, it was probably the most varied time I had at Jagex. I wrote shaders for the first time, I wrote networking code, I had to wrestle with RuneScape's very non-standard animation system, which resulted in spiders body-popping their way through the world at one point. The HTML5 client worked, but the performance wasn't great (did I mention we used JavaScript?), so instead a team was set up to write a native C++ client, but I didn't work on that.</p></div><figure><blockquote><p>I don't recommend writing games in JavaScript. I don't recommend writing ANYTHING in JavaScript.</p></blockquote></figure><div><p>For me, though, the absolute highlight of my time at Jagex was working on <em>Chronicle: RuneScape Legends</em>, which was a 1v1 digital CCG. Whenever you say that people assume it was a <em>Hearthstone</em> knock-off, but it was very much its own thing. You'd place cards to create an adventure for your character - perhaps fighting a small monster to gain gold, spending that on a big sword, and then using the sword to take on a bigger monster for bigger rewards. You'd lock in four cards at once, and your opponent would do the same. But you'd each resolve one card in turn, so you could interfere with your opponent's plans. If your opponent stole your gold before you could buy the sword, or sabotaged the sword just after you'd bought it, you'd be beaten to a pulp as you tried to fight the bigger monster bare-handed. There was lots of planning, and trying to get into your opponent's head. This game also wasn't commercially successful and shut down, but with Jagex's blessing it lives on as a fan remake, which is phenomenal to see. Not every game company would allow that.</p><p>&nbsp;When I came onto the project, it had just been greenlit from a prototype, and I was essentially given the brief of "we would like one (1) game backend, please". Flattering though that was, my line manager and I did eventually convince the powers that be that this wasn't a one-man job, but as the first backend developer on the game I did plan out the shape of the entire backend structure - game servers, profile systems, databases, matchmaking, client-server communication. Over the next two years we built it. We launched it, it worked, and seeing what I'd designed on paper up and running was absolute peak job satisfaction. Something I was doing more and more at this point was also mentoring junior developers. So my days weren't just coding, but also sitting down with other devs to discuss approaches to implementing different features that they would then tackle, doing a LOT of code reviews, and dodging requests to become a lead developer because I didn't fancy becoming a manager.</p><p>&nbsp;Once <em>Chronicle</em> was struggling and we were moved off it I ended up back on <em>RuneScape</em>. That was the beginning of the end for me. I worked on porting <em>Old School RuneScape</em> to mobile, which was absolutely the right thing for Jagex to do, but I discovered I didn't much enjoy the extra faff of mobile development, and I'd already reimplemented a<em> RuneScape</em> client once with HTML5. So I was definitely getting the itch to do something else. I went part-time for a while when I was starting out as an indie, but eventually I left completely.</p></div><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>You've left Jagex and have been working on your game, but tell me about this </em>other <em>thing you're doing at the moment, a government-funded apprenticeship scheme?</em></p><div><p><strong>CK</strong>: At the start of last year the UK government approved a Game Programmer apprenticeship. Apprentices get at least a year of on-the-job training, with the government subsidising the cost of employing them. I have a very part-time job working on the end-point assessment stage. I sign off on a 12-week project proposal, and after that they come back and do a couple of assessments, one on the project and one that checks their knowledge of game development more broadly. All being well they end up with the equivalent of a master's degree and a rock-solid start to their career. I've already assessed quite a few and they're a wonderfully talented bunch. I get genuinely excited by a lot of the projects, but unfortunately I can't tell you about any of them because I'm NDA'd up to the eyeballs.</p><p>The industry isn't going to stumble across the next generation of game developers by accident, we need to be actively training them up. With my solo indie hat on I can't do much - I'm doing all the code and design myself because it's cheaper (and fun!), and I don't have the skills to mentor and train a junior artist or composer. But this is a real chance to help, and the fact that it's paid also helps with the financials of being a sustainable indie!</p><p>I'd also love to see the games industry become a more diverse place, we'd get richer games. The low point at Jagex was the HTML5 client, at one point we were a team of three straight white men all called Chris. If you ask companies why they're not more diverse they'll often cite "the pipeline", which results in a not-very-diverse pool of potential employees. And they're not wrong. I remember at Jagex talking to a manager trying to hire for a role in one of the <em>RuneScape</em> content teams. I can't remember exactly how many applications she'd had come through, I think it was 83 (LOTS of people want to work on <em>RuneScape</em>!), but I do remember that exactly one of them was from a woman. If we want to fix this, we need to increase the diversity of the people entering the industry.</p></div><p>And the apprentices are a diverse bunch! I'm at the end of the assessment process so I can't claim credit for that, but I can be part of making the system work. The proportion of women isn't quite 50%, but it's a lot higher than the proportion of women doing games programming that we tend to see in the workplace. The ethnic breakdown is also closer to the demographics of the UK.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Thanks for your time Chris! Have a good one!</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164196/expanse-james-s-a-corey-new-book-mercy-gods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="tsuU1h">When <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22796464/expanse-leviathan-falls-final-book-excerpt"><em>Leviathan Falls</em></a><em> </em>hit bookstores in November 2021, James S.A. Corey — aka authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22816216/expanse-leviathan-falls-ending-james-sa-corey-interview">made it very clear to Polygon</a>: The Expanse series was over. Fans could be sad, but not really blame them; after 10 years, well over 5,000 pages, and a hit Syfy/Prime Video TV adaptation, a universe had been effectively spun. The duo had “told the story [they] wanted to tell.” There were new sagas to write, though — as evidenced by <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/james-s-a-corey/the-mercy-of-gods/9780316525572/"><em>The Mercy of Gods</em></a>.</p>
<p id="ryELvc">The first in a new series, the Captive’s War trilogy, Corey’s <em>The Mercy of Gods</em> tells the story of an alien invasion, the enslavement of a human population, and a scientist’s assistant, Dafyd Alkhor, who stumbles into a deeper mystery. During a recent virtual event, Franck cheekily described the book as “the disappointing love child of Frank Herbert and Ursula Le Guin,” while Abraham said it was a total departure from the types of stories they were able to tell in the Expanse series. “It’s the story of living as a slave in a totalitarian regime,” he said. “How you stay true to — and even discover — yourself, how you compromise, how you serve the regime and how you can undermine it.”</p>
<p id="3L9Yrx">Like <em>Dune</em>, Franck said, the timeline supporting the Captive’s War trilogy goes back thousands and thousands of years, and seismic events that reshaped the universe are mere notes in a textbook to the players involved in the core drama. And it starts here: Read on for the entire first chapter of <em>The Mercy of Gods</em>, which arrives this August.</p>
<hr id="4T9Yip">
<p id="gc8Wl0">Later, at the end of things, Dafyd would be amazed at how many of the critical choices in his life seemed small at the time. How many overwhelming problems had, with the distance of time, proved trivial. Even when he sensed the gravity of a situation, he often attributed it to the wrong things. He dreaded going to the end-of-year celebration at the Scholar’s Common that last time. But not, as it turned out, for any of the reasons that actually mattered.</p>
<p id="hsWjIu">“You biologists are always looking for the starting point, asking the origin question, sure. But if you want to see origins,” the tall, lanky man at Dafyd’s side said, pointing a skewer of grilled pork and apple at his chest. Then, for a moment, the man drunkenly lost his place. “If you want to see origins, you have to look away from your microscopes. You have to look up.”</p>
<p id="TQ4FCU">“That’s true,” Dafyd agreed. He had no idea what the man was talking about, but it felt like he was being reprimanded.</p>
<p id="Cr0HaC">“Deep sensor arrays. We can make a telescope with a lens as wide as the planet. Effectively as wide as the planet. Wider, even. Not that I do that anymore. Near-field. That’s where I work now.”</p>
<p id="ETskEu">Dafyd made a polite sound. The tall man pulled a cube of pork off the skewer, and for a moment it looked like he’d drop it down into the courtyard. Dafyd imagined it landing in someone’s drink in the Common below.</p>
<p id="vVEuPp">After a moment, the tall man regained control of his food and popped it into his mouth. His voice box bobbed as he swallowed.</p>
<p id="DU3kpJ">“I’m studying a fascinating anomalous zone just at the edge of the heliosphere that’s barely a light-second wide. Do you have any idea how small that is for conventional telescopy?”</p>
<p id="KbdO0g">“I don’t,” Dafyd said. “Isn’t a light-second actually kind of big?”</p>
<p id="Fy6fpE">The tall man deflated. “Compared with the heliosphere, it’s really, really small.” He ate the rest of the food, chewing disconsolately, and put the skewer down on the handrail. He wiped his hand with a napkin before he extended it. “Llaren Morse. Near-field astronomic visualization at Dyan Academy. Good to meet you.”</p>
<p id="4vH0R5">Taking it meant clutching the man’s greasy fingers in his own. But more than that, it meant committing to the conversation. Pretending to see someone and making his excuses meant finding another way to pass his time. It seemed like a small choice. It seemed trivial.</p>
<p id="PbXRHk">“Dafyd,” he said, accepting the handshake. When Llaren Morse kept nodding, he added, “Dafyd Alkhor.”</p>
<p id="gR3NKi">Llaren Morse’s expression shifted. A small bunching between his eyebrows, his smile uncertain. “I feel like I should know that name. What projects have you run?”</p>
<p id="SBzJJF">“None. You’re probably thinking of my aunt. She’s in the funding colloquy.”</p>
<p id="rgLoMJ">Llaren Morse’s expression went professional and formal so quickly, Dafyd almost heard the click. “Oh. Yes, that’s probably it.”</p>
<p id="Y421ly">“We’re not actually involved in any of the same projects,” Dafyd said, half a beat too quickly. “I’m just putting in my time as a research assistant. Doing what I’m told. Keeping my head down.”</p>
<p id="DGp5Kp">Llaren Morse nodded and made a soft, noncommittal grunt, then stood there, caught between wanting to get out of the conversation and also to keep whatever advantage the nephew of a woman who controlled the funding purse strings might give him. Dafyd hoped that the next question wouldn’t be which project he was working for.</p>
<p id="jmfAEo">“Where are you in from, then?” Llaren Morse asked.</p>
<p id="rEd9Uy">“Right here. Irvian,” Dafyd said. “I actually walked from my apartments. I’m not really even here for the—” He gestured at the crowd below them and in the galleries and halls.</p>
<p id="QubnQs">“No?”</p>
<p id="VRurlG">“There’s a local girl I’m hoping to run into.”</p>
<p id="LZOomV">“And she’ll be here?”</p>
<p id="r2LqKK">“I’m hoping so,” Dafyd said. “Her boyfriend will.” He smiled like it was a joke. Llaren Morse froze and then laughed. It was a trick Dafyd had, disarming the truth by telling it slant. “What about you? You have someone back at home?”</p>
<p id="bYoQ2n">“Fiancée,” the tall man said.</p>
<p id="BZZTez">“Fiancée?” Dafyd echoed, keeping his voice playful and curious. They were almost past the part where Dafyd would need to say anything more about himself.</p>
<p id="5VuNK1">“Three years,” Llaren Morse said. “We’re looking to make it formal once I get a long-term placement.”</p>
<p id="TPTw26">“Long-term?”</p>
<p id="70rlgu">“The position at Dyan Academy is just a two-year placement. There’s no promise it’ll fund after that. I’m hoping for at least a five-year before we start putting real roots down.”</p>
<p id="mXnKXq">Dafyd sank his hands in his jacket pockets and leaned against the railing. “Sounds like stability’s really important for you.”</p>
<p id="AkukcO">“Yeah, sure. I don’t want to throw myself into a placement and then have it assigned out to someone else, you know? We put a lot of effort into things, and then as soon as you start getting results, some bigger fish comes in and swallows you.”</p>
<p id="uwFqt7">And they were off. Dafyd spent the next half hour echoing back everything Llaren Morse said, either with exact words or near synonyms, or else pulling out what Dafyd thought the man meant and offering it back. The subject moved from the academic intrigue of Dyan Academy to Llaren Morse’s parents and how they’d encouraged him into research, to their divorce and how it had affected him and his sisters.</p>
<p id="gcdg9I">The other man never noticed that Dafyd wasn’t offering back any information about himself.</p>
<p id="rgJSEj">Dafyd listened because he was good at listening. He had a lot of practice. It kept the spotlight off him, people broadly seemed more hungry to be heard than they knew, and usually by the end of it, they found themselves liking him. Which was convenient, even on those occasions when he didn’t find himself liking them back.</p>
<p id="ir4L3C">As Morse finished telling him about how his elder sister had avoided romantic entanglements with partners she actually liked, there was a little commotion in the courtyard below. Applause and laughter, and then there, in the center of the disturbance, Tonner Freis.</p>
<p id="E5xGDG">A year ago, Tonner had been one of the more promising research leads. Young, brilliant, demanding, with a strong intuition for the patterns that living systems fell into and growing institutional support. When Dafyd’s aunt had casually nudged Dafyd toward Tonner Freis by mentioning that he had potential, she’d meant that ten years down the line when he’d paid his dues and worked his way to the top, Freis would be the kind of man who could help the junior researchers from his team start their careers. A person Dafyd could attach himself to.</p>
<p id="3CwMEc">She hadn’t known that Tonner’s proteome reconciliation project would be the top of the medrey council report, or that it would be singled out by the research colloquy, high parliament review, and the Bastian Group. It was the first single-term project ever to top all three lists in the same year. Tonner Freis—with his tight smile and his prematurely gray hair that rose like smoke from an overheated brain—was, for the moment, the most celebrated mind in the world.</p>
<p id="vhMhi3">From where Dafyd stood, the distance and the angle made it impossible to see Tonner’s face clearly. Or the woman in the emerald-green dress at his side. Else Annalise Yannin, who had given up her own research team to join Tonner’s project. Who had one dimple in her left cheek when she smiled and two on her right. Who tapped out complex rhythms with her feet when she was thinking, like she occupied her body by dancing in place while her mind wandered.</p>
<p id="crmiZo">Else Yannin, the research group’s second leader and acknowledged lover of Tonner Freis. Else, who Dafyd had come hoping to see even though he knew it was a mistake.</p>
<p id="UJ36mx">“Enjoy it now,” Llaren Morse said, staring down at Tonner and his applause. The small hairs at the back of Dafyd’s neck rose. Morse hadn’t meant that for him. The comment had been for Tonner, and there had been a sneer in it.</p>
<p id="2FOtiv">“Enjoy it now?” But he saw in the tall man’s expression that the trick wouldn’t work again. Llaren Morse’s eyes were guarded again, more than they had been when they’d started talking.</p>
<p id="Pf7lSw">“I should let you go. I’ve kept you here all night,” the tall man said. “It was good meeting you, Alkhor.”</p>
<p id="HoDiPP">“Same,” Dafyd said, and watched him drift into the galleries and rooms. The abandoned skewer was still on the guardrail. The sky had darkened to starlight. A woman just slightly older than Dafyd ghosted past, cleaning the skewer away and disappearing into the crowd.</p>
<p id="EADwvp">Dafyd tried to talk himself out of his little feeling of paranoia.</p>
<p id="tpF9ir">He was tired because it was the end of the year and everyone on the team had been working extra hours to finish the datasets. He was out of place at a gathering of intellectual grandees and political leaders. He was carrying the emotional weight of an inappropriate infatuation with an unavailable woman. He was embarrassed by the not-entirely-unfounded impression he’d given Llaren Morse that he was only there because someone in his family had influence over money.</p>
<p id="P674ug">Any one was a good argument for treating his emotions with a little skepticism tonight. Taken all together, they were a compelling case.</p>
<p id="EYAsa4">And on the other side of the balance, the shadow of contempt in Morse’s voice: <em>Enjoy it now</em>.</p>
<p id="nSZJtn">Dafyd muttered a little obscenity, scowled, and headed toward the ramp to the higher levels and private salons of the Common where the administrators and politicians held court.</p>
<p id="zuK1fT">The Common was grown from forest coral and rose five levels above the open sward to the east and the plaza to the west. Curvilinear by nature, nothing in it was square. Subtle lines of support and tension—foundation into bracing into wall into window into finial—gave the whole building a sense of motion and life like some climbing and twisting fusion of ivy and bone.</p>
<p id="vUbkNs">The interior had sweeping corridors that channeled the breeze, courtyards that opened to the sky, private rooms that could be adapted for small meetings or living quarters, wide chambers used for presentations or dances or banquets. The air smelled of cedar and akkeh trees. Harp swallows nested in the highest reaches and chimed their songs at the people below.</p>
<p id="sS6zbJ">For most of the year, the Common was a building of all uses for the Irvian Research Medrey, and it served all the branches of scholarship that the citywide institution embodied. Apart from one humiliating failure on an assessment in his first year, Dafyd had fond memories of the Common and the times he’d spent there. The end-of-year celebration was different. It was a nested series of lies. A minefield scattered with gold nuggets, opportunity and disaster invisibly mingled.</p>
<p id="0QeASh">First, it was presented as a chance for the most exalted scholars and researchers of Anjiin’s great medrey and research conservatories to come together to socialize casually. In practice, “casual” included intricate and opaque rules of behavior and a rigidly enforced though ill-defined hierarchy of status. And one of many ironclad rules of etiquette was that people were to pretend there were no rules of etiquette. Who spoke to whom, who could make a joke and who was required to laugh, who could flirt and who must remain unreachably distant, all were unspoken and any mistake was noted by the community.</p>
<p id="szXXUY">Second, it was a time to avoid politics and openly jockeying for the funding that came with the beginning of a new term. And so every conversation and comment was instead soaked in implication and nuance about which studies had ranked, which threads of the intellectual tapestry would be supported into the next year and which would be cut, who would lead the research teams and who would yoke their efforts to some more brilliant mind.</p>
<p id="JQSxAC">And finally, the celebration was open to the whole community. In theory, even the greenest scholar-prentice was welcome. In practice, Dafyd was not only one of the youngest people there, but also the only scholar-associate attending as a guest. The others of his rank on display that night were scraping up extra allowance by serving drinks and tapas to their betters.</p>
<p id="2sD420">Some people wore jackets with formal collars and vests in the colors of their home medrey and research conservatories. Others, the undyed summer linens that the newly appointed high magistrate had made fashionable. Dafyd was in his formal: a long charcoal jacket over an embroidered shirt and slim-fitting pants. A good outfit, but carefully not too good.</p>
<p id="iHSOap">Security personnel lurked in the higher-status areas, but Dafyd walked with the lazy confidence of someone accustomed to access and deference. It would have been trivial to query the local system for the location of Dorinda Alkhor, but his aunt might see the request and know he was looking for her. If she had warning… Well, better that she didn’t.</p>
<p id="YmZ8B9">The crowd around him grew almost imperceptibly older as the mix of humanity shifted from scholar-researchers to scholar-coordinators, from support faculty to lead administrators, from recorders and popular writers to politicians and military liaisons. The formal jackets became just slightly better tailored, the embroidered shirts more brightly colored. All the plumage of status on display. He moved up the concentration of power like a microbe heading toward sugar, his hands in his pockets and his smile polite and blank. If he’d been nervous it would have shown, so he chose to be preoccupied instead. He went slowly, admiring art and icons in the swooping niches of forest coral, taking drinks from the servers and abandoning them to the servers that followed, being sure he knew what the next room was before he stepped into it.</p>
<p id="wCQzQc">His aunt was on a balcony that looked down over the plaza, and he saw her before she saw him. Her hair was down in a style that should have softened her face, but the severity of her mouth and jaw overpowered it. Dafyd didn’t recognize the man she was speaking with, but he was older, with a trim white beard. He was speaking quickly, making small, emphatic gestures, and she was listening to him intently.</p>
<p id="iPTGdL">Dafyd made a curve around, getting close to the archway that opened onto the balcony before changing his stride, moving more directly toward her. She glanced up, saw him. There was only a flicker of frown before she smiled and waved him over.</p>
<p id="7TR2XA">“Mur, this is my nephew Dafyd,” she said. “He’s working with Tonner Freis.”</p>
<p id="xP87Gj">“Young Freis!” Trim Beard said, shaking Dafyd’s hand. “That’s a good team to be with. First-rate work.”</p>
<p id="5NOlc0">“I’m mostly preparing samples and keeping the laboratory clean,” Dafyd said.</p>
<p id="r3xtUL">“Still. You’ll have it on your record. It’ll open doors later on. Count on that.”</p>
<p id="mtb2Od">“Mur is with the research colloquy,” his aunt said.</p>
<p id="UkI6KW">“Oh,” Dafyd said, and grinned. “Well, then I’m very pleased to meet you indeed. I came to meet with people who could help my prospects. Now that we’ve met, I can go home.”</p>
<p id="EFWYxB">His aunt hid a grimace, but Mur laughed and clapped Dafyd on the shoulder. “Dory here says kind things about you. You’ll be fine. But I should—” He gestured toward the back and nodded to his aunt knowingly. She nodded back, and the older man stepped away. Below them, the plaza was alive. Food carts and a band playing guitar music that gently reached up to where they were standing. Threads of melody floating in the high, fragrant air. She put her arm in his.</p>
<p id="HJIcui">“Dory?” Dafyd asked.</p>
<p id="ucaxyV">“I hate it when you’re self-effacing,” she said, ignoring his attempt at gentle mockery. Dafyd noted the tension in her neck and shoulder muscles. Everyone at the party wanted her time and access to the money she controlled. She’d probably been playing defense all night and it had stolen her patience. “It’s not as charming as you think.”</p>
<p id="doStZj">“I put people at ease,” Dafyd said.</p>
<p id="wexbVf">“You’re at a point in your career that you should make people uneasy. You’re too fond of being underestimated. It’s a vice. You’re going to have to impress someone someday.”</p>
<p id="Xavf76">“I just wanted to put in an appearance so you’d know I really came.”</p>
<p id="5hf9oi">“I’m glad you did,” and her smile forgave him a little.</p>
<p id="WsfgyN">“You taught me well.”</p>
<p id="ooN9MI">“I told my sister I would look out for you, and I swear on her dear departed soul I will turn you into something worthy of her,” his aunt said. Dafyd flinched at the mention of his mother, and his aunt softened a little. “She warned me that raising children would require patience. It’s why I never had any of my own.”</p>
<p id="KMGhiR">“I’ve never been the fastest learner, but that’s my burden. Your teaching was always good. I’m going to owe you a lot when it’s all said and done.”</p>
<p id="zGQ3sQ">“No.”</p>
<p id="4veOtB">“Oh, I’m pretty sure I will.”</p>
<p id="v9PNC8">“I mean no, whatever you’re trying to soften out of me, don’t ask it. I’ve been watching you flatter and charm everyone all your life. I don’t think less of you for being manipulative. It’s a good skill. But I’m better at it than you, so whatever you’re about to try to dig out of me, no.”</p>
<p id="Mfl1Yw">“I met a man from Dyan Academy. I don’t think he likes Tonner.”</p>
<p id="gbsSjI">She looked at him, her eyes flat as a shark’s. Then, a moment later, the same tiny, mirthless smile she had when she lost a hand of cards.</p>
<p id="C06Sb5">“Don’t be smug. I really am glad you came,” she said, then squeezed his arm and let him go.</p>
<p id="jggMOn">Dafyd retraced his steps, through the halls and down the wide ramps. His face shot an empty smile at those he passed, his mind elsewhere.</p>
<p id="iTs0Wh">He found Tonner Freis and Else Yannin on the ground floor in a chamber wide enough to be a ballroom. Tonner had taken his jacket off, and he was leaning on a wide wooden table. Half a dozen scholars had formed a semicircle around him like a tiny theater with Tonner Freis as the only man on stage. <em>The thing we’d been doing wrong was trying to build reconciliation strategies at the informational level instead of the product. DNA and ribosomes on one hand, lattice quasicrystals and QRP on the other. It’s like we were trying to speak two different languages and force their grammars to mesh when all we really need are directions on how to build a chair. Stop trying to explain how and just start building the chair, and it’s much easier.</em> His voice carried better than a singer’s. His audience chuckled.</p>
<p id="DZycja">Dafyd looked around, and she was easy to find. Else Yannin in her emerald-green dress was two tables over. Long, aquiline nose, wide mouth, and thin lips. She was watching her lover with an expression of amused indulgence. Only for a second, Dafyd hated Tonner Freis.</p>
<p id="t0JloB">He didn’t need to do this. No one was asking him to. It would take no extra effort to turn to the right and amble out to the plaza. A plate of roasted corn and spiced beef, a glass of beer, and he could go back to his rooms and let the political intrigue play itself out without him. But Else tucked a lock of auburn hair back behind her ear, and he walked toward her table like he had business there.</p>
<p id="3ZHRB6">Small moments, unnoticed at the time, change the fate of empires.</p>
<p id="Yjwg6m">Her smile shifted when she saw him. Just as real, but meaning something different. Something more closed. “Dafyd? I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p>
<p id="Uht9wJ">“My other plans fell through,” he said, reaching out to a servant passing by with what turned out to be mint iced tea. He’d been hoping for something more alcoholic. “I thought I’d see what the best minds of the planet looked like when they let their hair down.”</p>
<p id="UfzJhg">Else gestured to the crowd with her own glass. “This, on into the small hours of the morning.”</p>
<p id="FuHRWk">“No dancing?”</p>
<p id="5eWC3E">“Maybe when people have had a chance to get a little more drunk.” There were threads of premature white in her hair. Against the youth of her face, they made her seem ageless.</p>
<p id="zRX3gu">“Can I ask you a question?”</p>
<p id="qp6DLQ">She settled into herself. “Of course.”</p>
<p id="3NjkNt">“Have you heard anything about another group taking over our research?”</p>
<p id="ccV6AU">She laughed once, loud enough that Tonner looked over and nodded to Dafyd before returning to his performance. “You don’t need to worry about that,” she said. “We’ve made so much progress and gotten so much acclaim in the last year, there’s no chance. Anyone who did would be setting themselves up as the disappointing second string. No one wants that.”</p>
<p id="h3QWOD">“All right,” Dafyd said, and took a drink of the tea he didn’t want. One member of Tonner’s little audience was saying something that made him scowl. Else shifted her weight. A single crease drew itself between her eyebrows.</p>
<p id="mAdv7S">“Just out of curiosity, what makes you ask?”</p>
<p id="7eMomK">“It’s just that, one hundred percent certainty, no error bars? Someone’s making a play to take over the research.”</p>
<p id="Ocb81I">Else put down her drink and put her hand on his arm. The crease between her eyebrows deepened. “What have you heard?”</p>
<p id="ZRBr1M">Dafyd let himself feel a little warmth at her attention, at the touch of her hand. It felt like an important moment, and it was. Later, when he stood in the eye of a storm that burned a thousand worlds, he’d remember how it all started with Else Yannin’s hand on his arm and his need to give her a reason to keep it there.</p>

It would also vindicate the legions of people like myself who have stuck with <em>Destiny</em> since the beginning, pouring hundreds of hours into killing aliens and collecting what they leave behind. </p><p>Bungie invited me to attend a recent remote hands-off demo of the game to experience a preview build of some of the expansion. I was able to catch a glimpse of a new story mission that takes players inside The Traveller, <em>Destiny</em>’s big iconic space ball, for the first time ever. I saw some of what could make the expansion’s new strike one of the most challenging yet. And I got to see the Prismatic subclass, which lets players mix-and-match specific light and dark powers like a Red Mage in <em>Final Fantasy</em>, in action against an enemy faction called the Dread which includes Strand-wielding foot-soldiers that pull Guardians toward them as well as winged threats that bring danger from new directions. </p><p>Unlike last year’s disappointing<em> Lightfall </em>campaign,  which didn’t unlock Strand until the end, players wont have to wait until the end of <em>The Final Shape</em> to begin using Prismatic builds. Game director Tyson Green confirmed during my session that the subclass will unlock early on with a default build that players will slowly open up over the course of the ensuing story missions. And while the team worked hard to make sure it felt like players’ old powers would still be viable, it certainly seems like the intent is for Prismatic to be the showcased tool box during the campaign, including its new Transcendence mode which makes abilities cool down even more quickly as players dish out damage. It remains to be seen how exactly this balance works in the rest of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s sandbox.</p><p><em>The Final Shape</em>, as its name suggests, will mark the end of players’ current journeys, and possibly the beginning of new ones. It promises a showdown with The Witness, <em>Destiny 2</em>'s version of  Sauron if you fused him with the ominous scheming of the Emperor from <em>Star Wars </em>and the confident nihilism of Marvel’s Thanos. He’s occasionally felt like a somewhat goofy addition to an otherwise complex, mysterious, and magisterial-looking sci-fi universe, but the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch trailer</a></span> teasing the emotional stakes and the potential corruption of Commander Zavala, <em>Destiny</em>’s walking moral compass, suggests a cutscene-filled confrontation that might be worth the years-long wait. </p><figure id="" data-id="ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-recommend-id="image://ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-recommend-id="image://ae2cfdcad4f51e01d3d98079fc167c84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pale Heart displays The Tower from Destiny 1." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then there’s the Pale Heart, Bungie’s name for a zone inside The Traveler which functions like a nostalgia-fueled gauntlet. Hallucinations of things from characters’ pasts, large chunks of early<em> Destiny</em>, including the Tower from the original before it was demolished at the start of the sequel, appear throughout it. The parts I saw looked like a mix of the Old City and The Dreaming City, combining vaulted ruins with patches of bucolic regrowth. Nothing was as immediately striking as some of the scenes from past expansions, but it was as detailed and beautiful-looking as the game’s been in its modern era.<br></p><p>Unlike previous raids, the one for <em>The Final Shape </em>will happen the same week it launches, hinting that the conflict with The Witness will indeed be resolved then and there rather than being sneakily dragged out for several weeks or until newer episodic content arrives. As someone who is used to Bungie dragging things out and moving the goal posts from one big bad to another, it’s hard to fathom what it will feel like after players win and The Witness is defeated. It’s also hard to imagine where <em>Destiny 2 </em>goes after that. </p><p>I asked Green whether players will come away from the latest expansion with a sense of where the game they’ve been playing for 10 years goes next. “Yes,” he said. “Okay not to be flip, by the end of the raid, yes, players will have a better sense for where the future of <em>Destiny</em> goes. And we will be developing some of those threats and some of those those new story arcs as the year progresses. So yeah, that is all stuff we intend to do. As this thread winds down, we have more stories to tell.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>To date, the entire Assassin’s Creed franchise remain single-player experiences. It’s part of the charm, as you can jump in and out of the gameplay with little effort. But times are changing, and many players want online functionality to increase longevity. So, is Assassin’s Creed Shadows multiplayer?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-shadows-multiplayer">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed Shadows Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>One would think that considering there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-naoe-and-yasuke-the-first-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two main characters</a> in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we’d have an opportunity to play cooperatively with a partner. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a single-player game with no multiplayer or cooperative game mode to speak of thus far. </p>



<p>Could that change? There’s always room for Assassin’s Creed to grow and evolve, but to include a co-op game mode? That’s unlikely. </p>



<p>If you want a multiplayer Ubisoft title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-rainbow-six-siege-season-start-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a> or Skull and Bones provide plenty of cooperative and competitive entertainment!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/was-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-a-real-samurai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Was Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Yasuke a Real Samurai?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-online-only">Is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Online Only?</h2>



<p>While Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t feature multiplayer, players still want to know about its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-assassins-creed-shadows-always-online-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online capabilities</a>. More importantly, is Assassin’s Creed Shadows online only? Thankfully, you do not require a constant internet connection to play the upcoming single-player experience. </p>



<p>Once you finish downloading and installing the game, you no longer require a constant internet connection to play. This is a welcome change, considering recent trends in gaming.</p>



<p>That said, Shadows will likely feature an in-game cosmetics shop, like previous titles in the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/until-then-wants-to-become-a-portal-to-filipino-culture-for-everyone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>AAPI Month coverage continues with an interview with Polychroma Games about their Phillipines-set story game, Until Then, coming out on June 25.</em></p><p>Even in its demo, Until Then rang plenty of bells for me as a Filipino-American. It reminded me of summer breaks when I would visit Manila, but with a fondness that outdid any discomfort I would have from walking under the sweltering heat and dodging cockroaches on the sidewalk. From colored chicks to bits of Tagalog, Filipino culture deepened the immersiveness of the story between the playful characterization and mini games.</p><p>This is the setting that Mickole Klein Nulud, founder of Polychroma Games and game director of Until Then, and his team sought to capture. Mark Borja is seemingly just another Filipino high schooler going through shenanigans like cramming for class and keeping up with the local rumor mill. However, magical realism starts to seep into the slice of life setting, hinting at the emotionally compelling story to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A Setting By Any Other Name</h2><p>The Philippines isn’t a glamorous city with robot toilets and vending machines at every corner. Until Then doesn’t tout fantasy gimmicks or child soldiers, yet Polychroma still decided to base its setting on Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Nulud tells IGN that the Philippines was integral to the story they wanted to tell, and it was a non-negotiable from the start. They initially had concerns on whether or not a global audience would find the Philippines relatable. However, the developers quickly abandoned their doubts. </p><p>“We wanted to write a story where we could apply the experiences of growing up here,” Nulud says. “Right from the start, the idea behind this game was to represent the Philippines and share the experiences we went through living here growing up here. It's fundamental to the game, so there were no other settings on the table.”</p><p>The plan was to create a universally relatable story with the Philippines as a backdrop. That way, it could appeal to global audiences as well as fellow Filipinos. “If we wanted to write a story in a game where you could reach into people's hearts, of course it has to be universal,” Nulud says. “But the setting, the context, the mannerisms that the story integrates–some of them are uniquely Filipino. So, we sprinkle in some references here and there, but not too much that will make the story confusing for other audiences.”</p><p>“We learned how to strike a balance between sprinkling in some references that players here would appreciate, but still [making it so] everyone would appreciate the main story itself.”</p><p>Most of the Philippine references appear in the settings, like the trash-littered streets and roaming stray dogs. However, Nulud and fellow developers found a way to gamify their experiences through mini-games and interactive parts of the game, even if it isn’t exactly how you would experience it in real life. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-4-1716912388902.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>For example, in the demo, Mark and Sofia take turns stabbing fish balls with skewers. However, they don’t just take the fish balls from the vendor and leave. You have to skewer the fish balls yourself by timing exactly where the stick stops above the frying balls, and then again for when exactly to stab it so that it actually sticks. That’s not actually how you buy or even eat fish balls in the Philippines, but it was a fun way for Nulud and his fellow developers to gamify a cultural experience. </p><p>Until Then also serves as one of the most recent and significant examples of Filipino representation. My Filipino friends and I have a hard time recalling Filipino representation in recent games. Josie Rizal from Tekken 7 is one of the most popular examples that still pops up, but that game came out nearly a decade ago. Nulud also recalled Rizal, but noted her inclusion in Tekken is only a small part of the game. In that sense, Until Then is a more fully fleshed out example.</p><p>“It's not just an element. It's not just like 10% Filipino representation. It's 100% Filipino representation,” says Nulud. “And I don't think there are–if there ever is–a game that has 100% representation. Maybe there's just one or two.”</p><p>“I think [in] that way, it is a strength. This is a game where you could really say that. That's really representative, first of its kind.”</p><h2>Filipino Time Capsule</h2><p>Cultural time capsules also exist, like the train station Mark uses early in the game to get to school where you need to buy the ticket from the machine. Nulud admits that it’s not that exciting because you’re just buying a train ticket. However, for him and others who used to commute using the Manila subway, it’s a fun reminder of their local transportation. </p><p>“It was really fun because I copied the interface almost 100% in the train station that we have here,” Nulud said. “That was just really fun for me because it's going to be a time capsule.” </p><p>“There have been changes to the train station that we have in the game from real life. Like, some of the design, some of the architecture of the train station…When you visit it now, it's slightly different from what it is in the game.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-6-1716912404196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Besides the train station that Nulud mentioned, it’s also a time capsule for technology and social media. Until Then takes place in 2014, even though the team started development in 2020. Facebook, which is still popular in the Philippines, is the main social media used in the story. You scroll through your timeline, liking and commenting on your friends’ posts, or even learn more about the world through the news stories and ads that pop up on your timeline. </p><p>“Back in something like 2010, we were only able to access it from a computer shop or internet cafe,” says Nulud. “But, starting in 2014, that's when Filipinos became more active or online. So that makes a lot of sense for the smartphone mechanics that we have where there's basically a Facebook clone in the game where you can like, share, and stuff.” </p><p>Even now, Facebook is the Philippines’ <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6759/social-media-usage-in-the-philippines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>most popular social media platform</u></a>. According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/essential-facebook-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DataReportal</u></a>, the Philippines ranks in Facebook’s top 10 most active countries with 91.9 million active Facebook users. For context, the last Philippine census counted 115.56 million people. The United States, second in the rankings, has 186.4 million active Facebook users, but about 333.29 million people. The ratios are skewed.</p><p>“Facebook is not dead here at all. It's the main platform. I know it's not big in the US right now, but here, it's synonymous to social media,” says Nulud.</p><h2>Inspirations for Until Then</h2><p>Besides Filipino culture, Polychroma Games prioritized innovative storytelling to strengthen Until Then’s narrative. Nulud described it as closer to a “cinematic experience,” but one where it was more like a visual novel with interactive elements. Instead of just clicking through options of dialogue, I mashed buttons to wake up our main character, bought a train ticket, plugged in a USB, scrolled through Facebook messages, and more. In that sense, it felt a lot more interactive than a traditional relationship-based visual novel where you might select options that cater towards specific love interests and eventually form a relationship with them. </p><p>Nulud’s main inspirations includes Night in the Woods, Infinite Fall’s narrative adventure game based on western Pennsylvania. I used to live in Pittsburgh, a setting that heavily inspired Night in the Woods. In that story, the mining town history, hilly suburban setting, and other environmentally unique pieces about it really made it feel like Pittsburgh and, as an extension, other western Pennsylvania towns. Until Then works similarly, painting a picture of Manila through its setting, even without exposition.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-1-1716912432244.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“When you look at Night in the Woods and this game, there's a lot of similarity in how we present dialogue where you can see the world,” Nulud says. “When I played [NITW], I was really amazed that you can present a story like this. Like, you can present it in a way that you're just exploring the world because, in very conventional visual novels, you only have backgrounds for settings and then characters just fade in and fade out. And, since so far in my career, I have always been interested in narrative in games. I take a lot of inspiration from how Night in the Woods presents its story. It's just so immersive, having it presented this way.”</p><p>“I'm interested to push the boundaries and explore different ways we can tell stories in games. And one way of doing that, I thought, was presenting it in a cinematic experience.”</p><p>Nulud also highlighted a few other inspirations including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Last Night</u></a> and, for Mark’s interest in piano, the anime Your Lie in April.  When asked about The Last Night, Nulud said, “It's pixel art, but it's not fully two-dimensional. It's 2D sprites, but set in a 3D space. And they take it even further by using modern graphics, the type that you would see in AAA games like reflection shaders and stuff like that. I got really inspired by that as well.”</p><h2>Something That Can’t Be Said</h2><p>Until Then taps into high school nostalgia with its high school setting. However, Nulud highlights that Until Then isn’t just about that. His favorite theme was “understanding communication,” something that’s emphasized throughout the game and something he enjoyed examining the nuances of. Other words for it include human understanding or human condition in general.</p><p>“The theme here is human condition,” says Nulud, “but that's very general. We don't talk about that. That is obvious, but if there's anything specific about the human condition that we highlight here, it's understanding [that] and its complexity. We really wanted to opt for a story that's really emotional, something, as I said earlier, something that will reach into people's hearts and strike a chord with them.”</p><p>“Maybe, yeah, sure, high school days can strike a chord with the audience. But I think we were really aiming for something bigger than that. Something that's outside of school. Something that is truly universal in the human condition or experience. We were really just aiming for something bigger. But definitely, yeah, there are elements of high school days that would make you wanna relive it.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/screenshot-5-1716912446002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nulud recalls how he read a comment from one player about how the demo made them feel “nostalgic,” even though they didn’t come from the same background as he and his colleagues. Even though Until then is based in the Philippines, it seemed to succeed in relating to players overseas with its message.</p><p>“Even though they didn't really live through any of this, they're not from the Philippines, their schools do not look like that in the game…By aiming for something bigger than school life, something more general than that, we were able to achieve that. Like, just being universal, and even people getting nostalgia for things that they didn't personally go through.”</p><p>Ultimately, Nulud hopes that players connect with the emotional story that his team worked to convey in Until Then. If you learn about the Philippines, cool, but the most important part is the story.</p><p>“We just really hope that, whoever plays this, for all the players that will go through the entire game–like, especially for me–I really hope that this game strikes a chord the same way all my inspirations did to me,” he says. “That's what we're really hoping for once this comes out.”</p><p>To Filipino players, he says, “As I said before, this is universal, but we sprinkled in some references here and there. So we really hope that you point these out when you talk about the game, and we'd really appreciate mentions of it because we put our heart into those references and just overall had fun, you know, putting references here that our fellow countrymen will get.”</p><p>Until Then is coming to PC and PlayStation 5. You can play the demo now on Steam.</p><p><em>Jess Reyes is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-minecraft-servers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-minecraft-servers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Personally, I prefer to play <em>Minecraft</em> by myself, but that’s not why you’re here. You’re looking for the best servers to play on, presumably with other people. If that’s not the case, it’s kind of strange that you clicked on the headline or link.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">This is more of a list of <em>popular</em> servers. The best server everyone else likes isn’t necessarily going to align with what you’re looking for. <em>Minecraft</em> is a very malleable game, it can be played in a lot of ways. Popularity is also not a great measuring stick for quality. However, if you don’t exclusively want to explore off the beaten path, here are some to consider.</p> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Minewind.net</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-minewind" data-injectable="false">10. Minewind</h2> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="26" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: play.minewind.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Minewind is essentially an expansion of survival mode to incorporate RPG concepts like classes and loot. However, further than that, it also bills itself as complete anarchy. There aren’t really any player rules, so griefing is completely fair game. You’re going to have to be careful, aggressive, or underhanded to actually survive in this cruel version of <em>Minecraft</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Havoc Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-9-havoc-games" data-injectable="false">9. Havoc Games</h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="24" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: top.havoc.games</strong></p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://havoc.games/">Havoc Games</a> started out as a server based around the <em>Walking Dead</em> series called The Mining Dead. It’s since become so much more than that, but their zombie survival mode still tends to be the main draw, and part of the reason why it still remains popular today.</p> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via WesterosCraft</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-westeroscraft" data-injectable="false">8. WesterosCraft</h2> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.westeroscraft.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">Fantasy kingdoms are fertile ground for recreation in <em>Minecraft</em>, and WesterosCraft has taken on the mighty task of replication Westeros from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. The team has been at it since 2011 and have constructed a hearty slice of the fantasy world for exploration.</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, WesterosCraft is largely a sightseeing and… that’s about it. However, if you want another way of interacting with the world, you can apply to join the team and have a hand in building it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MC Middle Earth</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-minecraft-middle-earth" data-injectable="false">7. Minecraft Middle Earth</h2> <p data-characters="32" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: build.mcmiddleearth.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">Minecraft Middle Earth (or MC Middle Earth) is similar to WesterosCraft but set in a <a href="https://www.mcmiddleearth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replica of Middle Earth</a> from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Considering I just went over the concept of this sort of sightseeing server, I’m not sure it’s necessary to explain further. If you want to see a <em>Minecraft </em>representation of the walk that Frodo and Sam took to dump jewelry into a volcano, this is what you’re maybe looking for.</p>
 <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that there is a New Player Quiz for getting in. One does not simply walk into Minecraft Middle Earth.</p> <figure data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Lord of the Craft</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-the-lord-of-the-craft" data-injectable="false">6. The Lord of the Craft</h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="19" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.lotc.co</strong></p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Something a little different. The Lord of the Craft is a huge medieval fantasy roleplay server. While its name sounds like a play on <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, it’s actually not set in that Universe, but rather a more <a href="https://www.lordofthecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general fantasy setting</a>. Not like the above Middle Earth server that is <em>actually</em> about <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true">Roleplay can be quite imposing next to more structured servers, and that’s not really any different here. You actually need to apply to get access to the server. That may sound inconvenient, but it’s to ensure that those who inhabit the server are familiar with the concepts of roleplay and won’t be disruptive to others. Despite that perceived inconvenience, the server has a very healthy player base, ensuring that the world remains lively at all times.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wynncraft</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-wynncraft" data-injectable="false">5. Wynncraft</h2> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address play.wynncraft.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">There are a few servers out there now that turn <em>Minecraft</em> into a conventional MMO, but none have found the <a href="https://wynncraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">success of Wynncraft</a>. There isn’t much in terms of actual building, but there’s are quests, loot, classes; everything you’d expect from a standard MMO experience. Heck, Wynncraft has an active player count that rivals some of the more mainstream ones.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Grand Theft Minecart</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-grand-theft-minecart" data-injectable="false">4. Grand Theft Minecart</h2> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: topms.mc-gtm.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em> but in <em>Minecraft</em> isn’t exactly the most novel of ideas, but one server does it better than the rest, and that’s <a href="https://grandtheftmc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Minecart</a>. There are guns, cars, a massive map, and more importantly: an active developer and playerbase.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PirateCraft</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-piratecraft" data-injectable="false">3. Piratecraft</h2> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.piratemc.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Pirates are cool. I mean, not, like, real modern-day pirates, but the romanticized old-fashioned kind. Those are cool. If you’re interested in sailing the waves of <em>Minecraft</em>, Piratecraft has been <a href="https://piratemc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruling the high seas</a> for over 10 years. You can build and pilot your own ship complete with functional cannons.</p>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">One thing to note is that this is a “tight-knit” community and isn’t quite the sprawling networks that some of the bigger <em>Minecraft</em> servers tend to be. However, there is almost always an active number of players available to interact with.</p> <figure data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Complex Gaming</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-2-complex-gaming" data-injectable="false">2. Complex Gaming</h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: hub.mc-complex.com</strong></p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Complex Gaming has ruled the roost for quite some time now. Rather than being one simple server, it hosts all sorts of Minecraft offshoots. Prominently, it’s a hotspot for <em>Pixelmon Reforged</em> players, but other mods and even Vanilla <em>Minecraft</em> servers are available.</p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">For these mods (such as <em>Pixelmon</em>), you do require the associated modpacks, but <a href="https://www.mc-complex.com/">their website</a> can point you in the right direction to get everything you need.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hypixel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-hypixel" data-injectable="false">1. Hypixel</h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false"><strong>Address: mc.hypixel.net</strong></p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">While the server has seen its ups and downs, Hypixel is still near <a href="https://hypixel.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the absolute top</a> of the server heap in terms of active playerbase. Like Complex Gaming, it hosts a tonne of different modes like Skyblock, Megawalls, and Warlords.</p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">Again, sheer playercount isn’t necessarily a marker for quality, but there’s a good reason that Hypixel retains its massive population and has for years. But moreover, if you’re looking to hit up one of the most happening spots, this is it.</p>

			<p>Today, Tencent's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-launches-level-infinite-publishing-brand-aiming-for-high-quality-global-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Level Infinite publishing label</a> announced the global release date of Tarisland. The free-to-play fantasy MMORPG looks a lot like Blizzard's World of Warcraft and, indeed, was first unveiled right after that game went offline in China (though it will return shortly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-brings-blizzard-games-back-to-china-in-summer-signs-deal-with-microsoft-to-bring-its-games-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanks to the new agreement between Microsoft, Activision, and NetEase</a>).</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4 and developed by Locojoy, a team of MMORPG fans, Tarisland will launch on PC (<a href="https://tarisglobal.com/en/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the game's website</a> - it is not listed on any store) and mobile platforms on June 21. Over three million users have pre-registered to download the game. Here's the game overview provided by Locojoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Classes &amp; Specializations:</strong> Pick one out of 9 classes, such as Warriors, Mages, and Priests, each with unique abilities and two specialized paths to master. Following the feedback of Western players, gender-unlocked classes will slowly roll out starting with Mages and Paladins.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Talent System:</strong> Craft your own unique play style using Tarisland's talent tree system, which allows for free customization to adapt to different combat scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging Raid Encounters:</strong> Team up with fellow adventurers to take on epic bosses and overcome unique game mechanics in intense cooperative raids. In Season 0, there will be five dungeons, eight 10-player raid bosses, and multiple PvE modes including the Arcane Realm, Universal Hall, and Dark Invasion. Each dungeon has three levels of difficulty.</li>
<li><strong>Vast Open World:</strong> Uncover the secrets of Tarisland's vast realm, filled with puzzles, adventures, and unique gameplay experiences that go beyond traditional questing.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Experience the thrill of raid progression seamlessly across mobile and PC devices with cross-platform compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Tarisland: Rage of the Dragon" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFc_s_ObaeM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The launch trailer embedded above shows off the game's final boss at launch, the Blight Dragon Covered in impenetrable scales, with a wingspan nearing 200 meters, this beast is the first dragon hatched in the universe and an unstoppable force on the battlefield, according to the developers.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this. Grab your wallet because soon you’ll be able to build your own Great Deku Tree! <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092?cmp=OBS-TOUIGIUW0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO revealed the build today</a>, which is essentially a 2-in-1 set allowing you to choose between two Great Deku Tree builds from <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hey-listen" data-injectable="false">Hey! Listen!</h2> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">When did LEOG builds get so expensive? I will admit, looking at the build, I didn’t expect it to have 2,500 pieces as the listing says it does, so that may just be the going price for that many bricks these days. I haven’t had the opportunity to build out my LEGO dreams in way too long. *Pushes up non-existent bifocals* Back in my day a massive set of LEGO ran you $50 and featured a massive build.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Even though the LEGO Great Deku Tree set doesn’t ship until September 2024, those interested <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092?cmp=OBS-TOUIGIUW0Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can pre-order today</a> if their willing to part with the price of a Nintendo Switch to get this set. It’s a bit too steep for me, even though it would look pretty nifty as a piece on my shelf.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Those who pre-order by June 7 will also get a free Water Park gift, which absolutely does not fit with the theme of The Legend of Zelda or the Great Deku Tree, but hey, more LEGO I guess.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The Great Deku Tree confirms long-withstanding rumors that LEGO was indeed working on a <em>Zelda</em> set. While the Great Deku Treet is cool and is a great first choice, I’m excited to see what kind of sets LEGO cooks up based around some more memorable moments from the game series.</p>

		<p>We'll keep this short, as the holiday week has me a little behind. But hey, did you know we're rapidly approaching the one-year anniversary of <em>Remap</em>? It's wild to think how much has happened in the past year. We'd intended to blow this out, but life moments got in the way—early June is an odd time on our personal <em>and</em> gaming—calendars. We'll be doing an all-day livestream playing a bunch of games, but we're already planning something even better for later in June. Consider June to be a month of celebrating this moment, a moment we could not have reached without you. Much more to say soon!</p><p>-pk, who highly recommends HBO's <em>The Sympathizer </em>show</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>You get to hear one of the two panels I hosted as part of last month's LudoNarraCon. Working with them with a blast, I hope you've enjoyed the podcasts! There's one more coming.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an After Dark ahead of <em>Remap</em>'s first anniversary. In the past, we've recorded these before a big moment, as a way of capturing our thoughts in a little time capsule. Naturally, we're a ball of anxiety all over again.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>You'll get to hear that After Dark.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> Remap Radio will get in the can again. I've finished both <em>Hellblade II</em> and <em>Animal Well</em>, so there'll be a lot of talk about. The end of my time with <em>Animal Well </em>was, like Janet, a little bit of a bummer. We'll get into it.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Beyond hearing Remap Radio, we'll kick off our all-day livestream with a variety of different games and fun times. You get a small hint: crowbar.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163823/pale-heart-destination-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ShQ8ex">The Pale Heart — the new location in<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>, which is located inside The Traveler — is more like a Destiny-themed funhouse than a completely new destination. And while that might sound like a boring or even disappointing way to end the first Destiny saga, it’s actually one of the most striking and engaging destinations in the franchise’s 10-year history.</p>
<p id="kAXq03">On a visit to Bungie HQ, I was able to explore The Pale Heart of The Traveler and learn about how exactly the studio is using Destiny nostalgia to fuel the end of the Light and Darkness saga. It’s a risky move to lean so heavily on the past, a fact that Bungie’s Catarina Macedo, project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions, and Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, are well aware of. </p>
<p id="PqPvZc">“The Pale Heart specifically is shaped by the memories of whoever is there,” said Macedo. This is why there is a very “Earthy” feel to the start of The Pale Heart, and why the original<em> Destiny</em>’s Tower plays such a big role in the safer half of the space, since it’s influenced by the player character’s memories. At the same time, the other half of the destination is controlled by The Witness, which inspires a darker, creepier, and more abstract environment.</p>

<p id="gU7MPA">After speaking to Macedo and Wommack, I spent several hours just roaming through The Pale Heart, soaking it in, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23927863">playing with the new Prismatic subclass</a>. And while I was initially worried about it feeling too much like other places I’ve visited before in Destiny, Bungie appears to have stuck the landing here — at least in everything I’ve seen so far. The Pale Heart strikes a very promising balance between pulling on my heartstrings as a longtime Destiny player <em>and </em>giving me a regular dose of something new.</p>
<p id="iiQLWQ">Every time I walked through a space I recognized, the environment shifted to something slightly different or off before the familiar area had a chance to overstay its welcome. For example, there’s the Tree of Silver Wings from Season of Arrivals inside The Pale Heart, but this version has been smashed together with Hive architecture from <em>The Witch Queen</em>. When you pair that together with the entirely unique environment around the tree, the area feels both new and familiar. </p>
<p id="3ZHwLF">It’s an effective trick — giving the brain a dose of “I recognize that” dopamine with a chaser of surrealism — one that I was constantly impressed by during my time at the event. It’s a bit hard to grasp how effective this is when you just read it on the page or see it in a quick gameplay video; I know I was skeptical before experiencing it myself. But the way Bungie has twisted its world here ends up being very effective. </p>

<p id="POGVRO">The entire trip left me feeling quite positive about <em>The Final Shape </em>expansion as a whole, but The Pale Heart genuinely wowed me in several places. Looking up to see The Speaker’s weird, mysterious machine covered in foliage next to two building-sized Ghosts forced me to stop and just take in the scenery for a moment. And that’s not something I do much in games that I’ve already spent thousands of hours in. </p>
<p id="7MXjBA">For longtime players like myself, it made me feel a bit like a kid in a candy store, to use a very tired simile. I was constantly stopping to go, “Oh wow, that’s this old location, but upside down!” or “I recognize this building, but how?” which was always followed by delight when I finally placed the memory. But the more I explored, the more the nostalgia became less important to the overall experience, and I found myself appreciating the whole package even more.</p>
<p id="BKrTiQ">I’m certain there will be some Destiny players out there who will be furious that Bungie reused so much old art to create The Pale Heart. But having experienced it, I think that’s the wrong way to look at it. Sure, I’ve been to this junkyard in the Cosmodrome before — it’s where I was first resurrected — but I don’t recall all the trees being shaped like hands back in the first <em>Destiny</em>. And that sounds so small, I know, but when you walk onto the abandoned highway and you see the hand trees growing up around The Witness’ massive fortress, the comfort of nostalgia is just enough to keep you pushing further into the unknown. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="mWbo27">When I first saw the debut trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic">Prismatic</a> — the new, “advanced” subclass coming to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841285/destiny-2-showcase-time-when-how-to-watch-bungie"><em>The Final Shape</em></a> — I told my friends, “This is the most significant change they’ve ever announced for Destiny.” And after a visit to Bungie HQ in Bellevue, Washington, to play part of the expansion early, I’m convinced I was right.</p>
<p id="Y62g1B">“Putting Prismatic in is probably going to change Destiny on a fundamental level,” Ben Wommack, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s combat area lead, told me at our on-site interview. “But that’s kind of the intention of releasing that kind of feature in the game.” </p>
<p id="WUsJ9U">If you’re unfamiliar, Prismatic doesn’t add any new abilities to the game, like the Stasis or Strand Darkness subclasses that Guardians have gotten in previous years (although each class is getting <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23841367/destiny-2-showcase-2023-final-shape-announcement-trailer-summary">a new Super and Aspect</a> in <em>The Final Shape</em>, which is separate from Prismatic). Instead, the idea is that Guardians can combine elements together from all of their subclasses to create far more elaborate and powerful builds than ever before.</p>
<p id="jYbJhC">For example, if I currently want to use the Thundercrash Super on my Titan, I have to be on my Arc subclass, because Thundercrash is an Arc ability. Prismatic lifts those restrictions — mostly — so when <em>The Final Shape</em> launches, I can use Thundercrash for boss damage while also running around with a Strand Shackle grenade and a Void-throwing Shield. </p>

<p id="F8Y19p">Then there’s Transcendence, which is a new Super-like ability that you can charge up by dealing Light and Darkness damage in equal measure. Damage with Light-based weapons or abilities fills up the Light bar, while the opposite fills up the Darkness bar. When you’ve filled both bars, you can “Transcend,” which refills all of your ability energy, temporarily increases your weapon damage and defense, and gives you a Transcendence-exclusive grenade.</p>
<p id="PD0W9u">It’s all very overwhelming, but like Wommack said, that’s kind of the point. </p>
<p id="sQ5bXi">“I think this is really us giving a big love letter to the master build crafters of the game,” said Wommack. “We’re gonna give you a lot to think about. And we do want you to think about it, because we think about it.”</p>
<p id="f0N8xq">Catarina Macedo, the expansion project lead for <em>Destiny 2</em>, went on to say that Prismatic works from two angles: rewarding players who already have a lot of game knowledge — the “master build crafters” Wommack mentioned — and encouraging players who have very little experience with crafting builds to get in on the fun. Prismatic gives you so many more options than you’ve ever had in Destiny that it’s nearly impossible to look at the Prismatic customization screen and not think, <em>OK, how am I going to make these things work together?</em></p>
<p id="4V0FtD">Now, I’ve put together quite a few builds in my decade with Destiny, but during my preview I repeatedly found myself jumping into my menu and making slight tweaks to my Prismatic setup. Finding a way to consistently charge up my Transcendence meter felt like a real dance, and it had me thinking about how well my loadout synergized with my class setup. I’d gotten a sweet Stasis and Strand Titan build together that let me freeze and suspend everything, but without any Light abilities, I was having a really tough time getting the Light side of my Transcendence buff bar going.</p>

<p id="3S8ZFH">To fix it, I started changing up my weapons, and I swapped a Strand melee for an Arc one. Now kills with my primary and heavy weapons were contributing to my Light bar, while most of my abilities gave me Darkness energy. Every time I tried out a new build, I’d have to go through this iteration process. And each time, the game would reward me for it, as if every piece of the puzzle I managed to slot in made me that much stronger. I wasn’t just build-crafting so I could take down a big raid boss or a difficult Grandmaster Nightfall, I was doing it because it was fun.</p>
<p id="ymrzFO">Fun as it was, I did leave Bungie HQ with a few concerns regarding Prismatic. </p>
<p id="omgDh8">First, I felt so powerful using Prismatic that I couldn’t help but wonder how Bungie ever plans to challenge me again. The Legendary campaign missions I played felt much easier than <em>Lightfall </em>and <em>The Witch Queen </em>once I figured out how to maximize my newfound powers. But Bungie has <a href="https://youtu.be/RqIvKN4gtto?t=6188">already promised</a> that the new <em>Final Shape</em> raid is going to be one of the franchise’s hardest, and after the uber-difficult <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/23859673/crotas-end-raid-walkthrough">Crota’s End reprise</a> last summer, I’m willing to give Bungie the benefit of the doubt here.</p>
<p id="5JfBrY">My more serious concern was over what abilities and Aspects the developers have decided to include with Prismatic, as you can currently only pair certain abilities from each element together.</p>
<p id="2pIu4G">The team at Bungie decided to use some of the least popular Aspects from each class when making Prismatic. This meant I only had access to Aspects I don’t spend a lot of time using. On one hand, that was pretty exciting, as it helped the whole package feel fresh. On the other hand, I couldn’t help but wonder what kinds of builds I’d be able to make if Bungie removed the restrictions even more. </p>

<p id="L0sZX8">What if I could pair the Solar Titan’s Sol Invictus Sunspots Aspect with the Void Titan’s Controlled Demolition Aspect so I could spread explosive, healing puddles of fire around the entire arena? Surely that would be even stronger and harder to balance than the Prismatic I played during my preview — which is probably why both of those Aspects are unavailable for Prismatic. But the new subclass is so fun that it’s a bit of a bummer that I can’t just play out whatever bizarre Titan fever dream my brain can come up with.</p>
<p id="g8Qij5">That might sound like whining because you can only have cake <em>or </em>ice cream — and it kind of is — but that’s OK with the folks I spoke to at Bungie.</p>
<p id="qEthZJ">“We have a lot of future plans that we’re hoping to, you know, change and react to, depending on how players react to Prismatic in the first day, first weekend, through the raid race, through the first week,” said Wommack. He told me that the developers want and expect players to think about how non-Prismatic Aspects would impact their Prismatic build. But the hope is that those same players would also ask themselves questions like, “Well, how would Bungie balance that?”</p>
<p id="MaHWJa">There are a few ways to look at Wommack’s statement there, but to me it’s clear that Prismatic is an experiment, like Stasis was for the subclass 3.0 system back in 2020. Ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>’s launch, that experiment is already the most interesting thing that’s come to Destiny in years. But what will this experiment look like in a few months, or even next year? That’s the question that all Destiny fans should really be asking once <em>The Final Shape</em> arrives on June 4. </p>

Upon buying into the membership, players will be given instant access to the ongoing season’s battle pass, be granted ten level skips to get ahead of the grind, and receive a Bravo pack, which is <em>Siege</em>’s equivalent to loot boxes. Every month, players will also be given ten more level skips and another Bravo pack on their renewal date. Finally, folks who subscribe to the sub will also get a cosmetic drop with one legendary item and whatever an Epic bundle might be on the 28th of each month.</p><p>There’s a decent amount of stuff there for the diehard fans of <em>Siege</em>, and the rest of the battle pass rewards also give out unique weapon and operator skins—as well as in-game currency to add value—but the timing of the sub couldn’t be worse. <em>Siege </em>is in the middle of its ninth year, which would be impressive if the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current roadmap for the year</a></span> hadn’t already let down players with its gaping lack of new content.</p><p>The roadmap for the next half year includes a lot of reworks to existing characters and systems, and while part of <em>Siege</em>’s plans for a long while, it’s not met with a wealth of new additions to keep fans happy. Such reworkings are, at this point, a staple of maintaining a live-service title. These games can’t always just throw in new maps, characters and abilities <em>every</em> season, and at some point that constant growth slows to account for the imbalances it all creates. Eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-season-20-evo-armor-legend-abilities-1851218153">whole systems and locations need to be reworked</a></span> or completely overhauled. </p><p>The same has happened to games as big as <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, however most games don’t go most of the year with as few additions as <em>Siege </em>is making in 2024. It has added one new character, and <em>Siege </em>will add at least two more over the next few seasons, but the absolute bulk of “additions” coming for the rest of the year are changes to things that already exist in the game, which is beginning to become a sore spot for the community at the moment. And then here comes a bunch of new cosmetics, but they’re locked behind a new paywall.</p><p>To throw further fuel on the fire, subscriptions like this are commonplace in games that are otherwise free-to-play, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span><em>,</em> but <em>Siege </em>has remained a premium title over the years.

Even with what little information the new update gives, there are already theories that this is more than just a <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> remake—it may be a whole trilogy.<br></p><div data-video-id="196766" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="196766,196452,196001" data-current="196766"><div><p>Why Do I Suck At FF7 Rebirth's Piano Mini-Game?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196766/196766_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22321.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The remake’s resurgence came in the form of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X</a></span> (formerly Twitter) from the officia<em>l Dragon Quest</em> account. A short 20-second teaser reveals a fancy logo as well as the remake’s official platforms: PS5, Xbox Series, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The post has a message attached that reads, “The legend of Eldrick draws near.” Given that we haven’t gotten an update on the game in three years, it’s a little disappointing that the teaser didn’t show off any gameplay or new screenshots, though we do know that it will be done in Square Enix’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082">HD-2D</a></span> style, which blends pixelated character sprites with more expansive and detailed open worlds.</p><p>The detail that has fans most excited, however, is the lack of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> in the announcement. Only the series logo is shown, which has people theorizing that in addition to <em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, the first and second games will be included as a remake package. </p><p>This theory also comes from the “legend of Eldrick” message in the original post. Eldrick is a recurring name and title throughout the series used to refer to the game’s hero. The name comes from the original <em>Dragon Quest</em>, which references Eldrick as the protagonist’s heroic ancestor. This Eldrick is of narrative importance to<em> Dragon Quest 1</em> and <em>2</em>, and <em>Dragon Quest 3 </em>tells the story of the original Eldrick. The original three titles are referred to as the Eldrick trilogy. </p><p>To add fuel to the fire, reliable leaker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-6-logo-green-leak-midori-atlus-sega-1851499836">Midori</a></span> weighed in on the news with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795163362344472878&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795163362344472878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handful</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795158319201440033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795158319201440033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of information</a></span> on X.
