The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch.

"We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years.

<p>"You want to see something cool?"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of the cult 2015 movie <strong>Turbo Kid</strong>, rejoice! The upcoming Metroidvania sequel to the post-apocalyptic action movie is coming to Switch on 5th August 2025.</p>
<p>We first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> in February 2024, before it launched on Steam in April of that year. Now, the wait is over for Switch owners as you'll be able to pedal through the wasteland next month.</p>
<p>Developed by Outerminds, Turbo Kid takes place in a futuristic version of the '80s, where neon lights aren't necessarily a good thing. The world has crumbled; water is hard to come by and the wasteland is ruled by tyranny. So, what do you do? Grab your BMX and get biking.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gorgeous pixel art and a fantastic electronica soundtrack from Le Matos, even if you've never seen or heard of the movie, it's one to keep an eye on. Here's a rundown on what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedal. Slash. Explode. Repeat. -</strong> Rediscover the Metroidvania you should have grown up with. Blaze your trail through a mutant-infested wasteland, upgrade your arsenal of absurdly deadly weapons, and leave a trail of pixelated guts in your wake—all from the seat of your trusty BMX.</p>
<p><strong>BMX Combat -</strong> Who needs a horse when you have a bike with attitude? Call your BMX anytime to boost through maps, unlock shortcuts, smash enemies, or just pull sick tricks. It’s the first true Metroidvania where two wheels matter (no need to fact-check that).</p>
<p><strong>Slash, Shoot, Splat -</strong> Machetes? Of course. Turbo Glove™? Absolutely. From electric blasts to saw blades, your toolkit is overflowing with over-the-top destruction. Rip through enemies with style and turn every screen into a spray of beautifully deranged pixel gore.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Explore, Freedom to Wreck -</strong> Set just after the events of the film, forge your path through a twisted world filled with bizarre characters and unexpected choices. Who you help—or hurt—will shape your journey across multiple playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>All Killer, No Filler -</strong> Love lore? It’s here. Hate it? Skip it. We built Turbo Kid with pure gameplay in mind: no unskippable cutscenes, no walls of text—just fast, fluid action and flexible storytelling that works whether you’re exploring or speedrunning.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-cancelled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down-as-part-of-microsoft%E2%80%99s-layoffs.1234302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for Darrington Press' latest board game, <em>Solar Gardens</em>. The tabletop publishing arm of Critical Role's latest project is a strategic, tile-placement board game set in a solarpunk sci-fi city where building a garden helps build sustainable energy for the future.</p>

<h2>The <em>Solar Gardens</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, S<em>olar Gardens</em> is a tile-drafting board game that brings players into a utopian future. One where you transform city rooftops into verdant, sustainable gardenscapes with a combination of renewable energy and imaginative design.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-game-contents.jpg?itok=lKqG_uto 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-game-contents.jpg?itok=2pMuqiIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Solar Gardens</em> is designed for 2-5 players. A single game takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. Players take turns drafting and placing tiles on a map. Each tile represents greenery, solar panels, turbines, rainwater collectors, cultural hubs, and more. Players must strategically place these tiles to boost energy production, biodiversity, and aesthetic appeal, to create a living rooftop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Each playthrough of the game introduces new challenges. It encourages both competitive and casual players to experiment with different strategies in each game. If you want to play out the fantasy of building a beautiful future, or just want to beat your friends in landscaping, this game provides.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> was designed by Eric Slauson (<em>MonsDrawsity</em>, <em>Kaiju Haiku</em>) and Alex Cutler (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skate-summer-gets-padded-up-for-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Skate Summer</em></a>, <em>A Place for All My Books</em>) and illustrated by Daniel Clarke. Echoing its overt environmentalist themes, the game is produced with biodegradable, plastic-free materials and will use paper stickers to hold its contents together in transit.</p>

<p>Lastly, each copy of the game sold will help fund reforestation in US national parks through the National Forest Foundation's Sapling Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solar Gardens is the latest tabletop game published by Darrington Press, joining a catalog of critically acclaimed, bestselling products including <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Queen By Midnight</a>, </em>the gaslamp fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, and the runaway fantasy TTRPG hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

<p>The game is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $44.99. It is set to release on July 31.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>

            <p>
Three former senior Ubisoft employees - including one-time chief creative officer and second-in-command Serge Hascoet - have received suspended prison sentences and fines from a French court after being found guilty of harassment prior to their departure five years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hascoet - along with Ubisoft's former editorial boss Tommy François and game director Guillaume Patrux - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ubisoft-execs-stand-trial-in-france-accused-of-harassment">appeared in a French court earlier this year</a>, accused of psychological and sexual harassment during their time at the company. All three left Ubisoft in 2020, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">wave of resignations and dismissals</a> among senior employees and executives, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">serious allegations of sexual misconduct become public</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">reported by the Guardian</a>, Francois has now received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €30,000 fine after being found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment, and an attempted sexual assault. During the trial, it was alleged Francois had restrained a female employee while trying to kiss her on the mouth. He was also accused of forcing a female co-worker to do handstands while she wore a skirt, alongside other incidents.
</p>
<p>
Hascoët - who faced accusations of racist comments and other behaviour during the trial - was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment by the court, receiving an eight-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000. Patrux has been handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000 after being convicted of psychological harassment. During the trial, it was alleged Patrux had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, and set fire to a colleague's beard with a cigarette lighter, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">asked how much he knew of the issues taking place in his company</a> prior to the sexual misconduct allegations becoming public, Ubisoft CEO and co-founder Yves Guillemot said, "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will" in a carefully worded statement. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he added.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 2 arrived with a bunch of titles that had to perform well if they were going to be worth your time. Arguably, none were more in need of a silky smooth frame rate than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, which had to be top notch if it was ever going to appeal to the fighting fans.</p>
<p>We had a blast with the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> last month, with the performance in all modes (apart from World Tour) being a particular highlight. But for those who want the specific numbers, the experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6KBxxvdXo">Digital Foundry</a> have finally joined the fight to give a detailed rundown of all the tech specs in Capcom's latest.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with image quality, DF's Thomas Morgan states that the Switch 2 version "punches well above its weight". The Switch 2 puts up <strong>960x540p</strong> resolution in docked mode, with the DLSS upscaler boosting things to <strong>1080p</strong>. The analysis notes that you may encounter some flickers here and there, but it's a "win on balance" in the grand scheme of things, and even appears crisper than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Naturally, the image quality pales in comparison to the PS5's 4K offering, but the textures are a notable upgrade from the Series S and fall closer in line to what you'd find on the PS4.</p>
<p>Some settings are missing on Switch 2 — the depth of field effect, 'Crowded' background NPCs, no movement for physics-based particles — though DF emphasises that these are "never game-breaking".</p>
<p>The portable mode opts for a <strong>640x360p</strong> resolution, with DLSS reconstructing it up to <strong>720p</strong>, and lighting and shadows take a big hit because of it, winding up closer to the base PS4 edition. There's a docked/handheld comparison in the above video around the 8:20 mark that's well worth a look if you want to see the changes in action.</p>
<p>The World Tour modes are deemed "less polished in their visual delivery overall," with regular NPC pop-ins and reduced frame rates for characters at range. That said, DF is quick to point out that Switch 2 is "not alone in presenting these problems, rather, it inherits them from the other console releases".</p>
<p>In terms of frame rate, things are locked at a "perfect" <strong>60fps</strong> in both docked and handheld in the fighting rounds, but they do drop to around 45fps in the pre-fight hype sequences — not that it affects the game at all. The World Tour mode, as expected, is not as smooth, with the unlocked frame rate reaching anywhere from <strong>30-60fps</strong>, and getting capped at 30 in the side-on battles.</p>
<p>All in all, then, it sounds like a generally strong technical experience on Switch 2. You can see all of this analysis in action in the above Digital Foundry video, but for our thoughts on the game, you'll find our full review below.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The current custodians of the World of Darkness tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> universe are bang up for doing more video game adaptations like the troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, according to White Wolf brand marketing manager Jason Carl. In fact, they may be working on a few already, with Carl naming Mage: The Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming and the Dark Ages setting as deserving of "the Bloodlines treatment".</p>
<p>People who've been keeping up with the vamps and their video game misadventures may find that last phrase a bit rich. For clarity, I assume that by "Bloodlines treatment" Carl means "we're going to make a big 3D RPG with a lot of lore". Rather than "we're going to delay it so often it becomes a running joke, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">fire the original narrative director</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">hand it to a different studio</a> with no real track record for RPGs, then tell people it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more spiritual successor than sequel</a>". </p><!--more-->
<p>White Wolf are the official licensing and publishing entity for all World Of Darkness adaptations. They were acquired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> outfit Paradox Interactive in October 2015, and are now co-publishers for Bloodlines 2. As for the World of Darkness itself, this is a sprawling modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> fiction analogous to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which encompasses several apocalypses and several table-top RPGs.</p>
<p>While the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is by far the most famous World Of Darkness video game adaptation, there are plenty more out there - 2003 hack-and-slash Hunter: The Reckoning and, much more recently, a bunch of Werewolf games, plus some mobile projects. In a new interview with PCGamesN, Carl made no bones of White Wolf's desire to keep cranking out the spin-offs.</p>
<p>"Who says we're not already?" he joked in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/world-of-darkness-games">PCGamesN</a>. "The answer is yes. All of those supernatural creatures have their own stories to tell, and many of them are just waiting their turn and for the right story to come along.</p>
<p>"It's not just Hunter and Werewolf," Carl went on. "It's no secret that, when we set up our in-house publishing business, we've been exploring many of the other World of Darkness games that people have been waiting for and that are underdeveloped. We've got our eyes on Mage, we've got our eyes on The Dark Ages, we've got our eyes on Changeling; we're spending a lot of time thinking about these three, and other games that people have been waiting for."</p>
<p>Carl is himself a former tabletop RPG game designer, having started out at D&amp;D creators Wizards of the Coast in the 1990s. In the chat with PCGN, he was especially enthusiastic about adapting Mage, a tabletop game that first released in 1993 and is, as you may guess, all about sorcery.</p>
<p>"I have spent considerable time thinking about what Mage would look like in a new edition," he said. "The world we live in today is very different from what we imagined it would look like when the White Wolf team were building those previous editions of Mage, and I think we're all looking forward to the challenges of figuring out how Prime and Paradox work in this world, as opposed to the world we thought we were going to get."</p>
<p>I'm not that familiar with Mage, but I gather from the White Wolf wikis that <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime</a> is one of the nine spheres of magic - it "governs the raw energy of reality". While <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> "is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of the mage."</p>
<p>This certainly seems adventurous, for a magic system, in that I can't quite picture how you'd translate all that into an everyday fireball spell. How am I supposed to splat cellar rats with *checks notes* an "Odyllic Force"? My goodness, could this be an arcane institution with <em>implications for things beside combat and levelling up</em>? I am pleased by the prospect of a video game based on such wild notions. Almost as much as I am sceptical of White Wolf's big promises, given their and Paradox's handling of the "spiritual successor" to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.</p>
<p>"There's no obstacle or gatekeeping function that would prevent any of these from making it out into a videogame and getting the Bloodlines treatment," Carl concluded. "It's a question of time, resources, the right development partners, and story." I don't know, Carl. The first three of those seem like pretty significant obstacles. They seem like much the same obstacles Bloodlines 2 has been smashing its pointy chops against since 2019, in fact. Maybe at least ship your new Vampire game - due in October, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">a recent round of layoffs at developers Chinese Room</a> - before you make any bets on the rest of the World of Darkness.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-world-of-darkness-rpgs-deserve-the-bloodlines-treatment-say-white-wolf-especially-mage-the-ascension]]></content:encoded>

The game looked great, with gorgeous visuals, a slick art style, and gameplay that seemed like a combination of <em>Deus Ex, Dying Light,</em> and the old <em>Perfect Dark</em> games. However, the gameplay trailer didn’t include a release date. And now it seems this cool-looking reboot won’t ever see the light of day. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531]]></content:encoded>

To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.

Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three former Ubisoft executives have been given suspended prison sentences in a harassment trial that began in March and was delayed until June. </p>



<p>First reported by French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/07/02/harcelement-chez-ubisoft-trois-anciens-cadres-condamnes-a-des-peines-allant-jusqu-a-trois-ans-de-prison-avec-sursis_6617387_4408996.html">Le Monde</a>, former vice president of editorial and creative services, Thomas François, was found guilty of moral and sexual harassment and attempted sexual assault. He was fined €30,000 and given a three-year suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Former chief creative officer at Ubisoft, Serge Hascoët, was accused of making lewd and racist comments and of allegedly harassing a Muslim employee by replacing her desktop background with images of food and placing food on her desk while she was fasting for Ramadan. He was fined €45,000 and received an 18-month suspended prison sentence. </p>



<p>Lastly, former game designer at Ubisoft, Guillame Patrux, was accused of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. </p>



<p>Patrux, Hascoët, and François, were all part of the toxic culture Ubisoft had allowed to fester that employees called out in 2021 with an open letter from employees calling for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-workers-support-activision-blizzard-employees/">A Better Ubisoft</a>. While Activision Blizzard employees were calling out the leaders who perpetuated ABK's own toxic culture, Ubisoft employees stood up to support workers at Activision Blizzard King, while also calling out their own studios issues. </p>



<p>A year later, Ubisoft employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-a-better-ubisoft-worker-demands-not-met-25-percent-quit/">called out chief executive officer Yves Guillemot</a> for seemingly not responding to the demands staff had made to improve the company culture, while claiming that he took the issues they had raised<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-acknowledges-employees-letter-promises-new-update-in-q3-employees-claim-their-demands-were-sidelined/"> "<em>seriously</em>."</a></p>



<p>One of the key issues employees raised was that when issues with executives like Hascoët were brought forward, rather than that executive losing their job, they were transferred to another position in Ubisoft's global team. It's worth noting that Hascoët was never officially fired from the company, and instead resigned, reportedly after a conversation was had regarding the allegations against him.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youll-soon-be-able-to-buy-dlc-in-installments-because-of-course.1234194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In another sign that the industry is doing very well and everything is going completely fine, it'll soon be possible to pay for certain in-game DLC purchases in installments rather than in one lump sum.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-you-can-buy-in-game-dlc-and-pay-it-off-later/1100-6532906/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamespot</a>, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company Affirm has teamed up with commerce outfit Xsolla in order to allow players to "pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more on payment plans" (that's Gamespot's wording).</p>

<p>Essentially, you'll see Affirm as another payment option when you make a DLC purchase of this magnitude. You'll then be subject to a credit check, and if you pass that check, you'll be able to buy your DLC across several installments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dlc-installments-fortnite-squid-game.jpg?itok=lRQfhS-f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dlc-installments-fortnite-squid-game.jpg?itok=tziZE49C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>could be one of the first games to allow paying for DLC in installments.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which games this service will be appearing in. Xsolla works with lots of studios and publishers, but it hasn't announced which companies have signed up for the Xsolla-Affirm partnership.</p>

<p>However, as Gamespot points out, Epic Games has been confirmed as a partner for the studios, which means we could start seeing BNPL-based DLC purchases in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what kind of ungodly&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skin could cost that much, you might be overlooking in-game currency; a bundle of 13,500 V-Bucks will <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop/v-bucks?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set you back $90</a>, so hey, why wouldn't you want to pay that back piece by piece?</p>

<p>This deal comes at a time when many of the most popular games around right now are free-to-play (<a href="https://store.rockstargames.com/buy-gta-v-shark-cash-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and paid</a>!) titles <a href="https://store.ea.com/apex-legends/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complete</a> with in-game purchases, and many of those can run $50 or more, so it's easy to see why this decision has been made.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=wEA6LQ0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-dlc-installments.jpg?itok=a93Lseoq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paying for expensive&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>currency bundles might get "easier" in future.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's hard not to see this as an indictment of an industry that appears to be getting greedier with players' wallets; perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I'm just not sure $50 and upwards in DLC or microtransaction purchases can be healthy, unless it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">substantial expansion</a> (and even then, you're unlikely to pay that much).</p>

<p>It's worth noting here that no game has adopted this system yet, and that it might be a while until we see it crop up as part of in-game stores. Still, that's almost certainly on the cards for the future. Yay!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Update</strong>: ZeniMax Online Studios senior producer Chris Linn has confirmed the MMO's cancellation in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-linn-1185402b_hi-everyone-our-amazing-mmo-project-was-activity-7346206126515884032-oeTE/?rcm=ACoAACHLVEgBTtk4MMJ6ltS4eUgUe6T6Fj4eoak">post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Original story follows</strong>:</p>
<p>Microsoft have reportedly cancelled an MMORPG that was in the works at ZeniMax Online Studios, developers of The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">Elder Scrolls Online</a>, as part of the company's wider layoffs.</p>
<p>This is according to a post from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which follows separate reports that the layoffs have seen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>. It very much looks like a pool of canned projects are accumulating at MS's feet as part of these cuts, though the company are still yet to confirm anything.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG was codenamed "Blackbird" and had been in development since 2018, according to Schreier. It would have been the second game ZOS has been principal developer of since their founding in 2007, the first being Elder Scrolls Online, which has received regular updates and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">expansions</a> in the decade and change since release.</p>
<p>While we've not seen or heard much about Blackbird over the years, ZeniMax Online Studios posted job applications seeking people to work on a new engine for a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/eso-boss-says-his-devs-have-been-killing-it-confirms-the-studio-is-working-on-a-new-game-with-a-new-engine/">around 2019</a>.</p>
<p>"We've learned a lot bringing the world of The Elder Scrolls to life, and it's time for us to take those lessons and build a new AAA IP," reads a <a href="https://www.zenimaxonline.com/joinus">careers page on ZOS' website</a>. "The vision for our next game is grand in every sense of the word, and that's why we're developing a new engine to support the needs of the project and studio. Because we're in early pre-production, this is the perfect time to join us and make your mark on an incredible new project."</p>
<p>If the reports are legit, it's sad we'll never get to see what Blackbird could have evolved into. I've never really gotten that into ESO despite loving an old roll of paper, simply because I prefer Elder Scrolls as a single player game. But much like its brother from another mother <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, ESO has certainly stuck around for the long haul, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-wasnt-the-biggest-threat-to-the-elder-scrolls-online-it-was-skyrim">evolving a lot over the years</a> and establishing a loyal audience.</p>
<p>As much as the reported game cancellation sucks, though, it's obviously the people being impacted by these layoffs that really matter. "As one illustration of just how sloppy and chaotic today's mass Xbox layoff has been," Schreier wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsykj2ccls22">follow-up post</a>, "some employees at Zenimax Online Studios are now watching their Slack accounts abruptly get locked out. No message from HR, no word on whether they still have a job, just an ominous Slack deactivation."</p>
<p>Christ.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

The latest furore is likely a momentary blip until developer NetEase fully unveils all the cosmetics releasing in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ third season, but as some of the skins leak out ahead of their announcement, Spider-Man fans are angry about the absence of one of the web slinger’s most iconic looks: the Symbiote Suit.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196032" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="270" data-playlist="196032,195896,195358" data-current="196032"><div><p>Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21556.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even if you’re not paying attention, you’ve probably seen the Symbiote Suit at least a few times since its debut in the comics in the ‘80s. The black-and-white outfit is arguably Peter Parker’s most iconic alternate suit when he’s not wearing his trademark blue-and-red onesie. As the name implies, the look is the result of a symbiotic, goo-like alien lifeform taking over the hero, causing an internal struggle between Peter and the creature’s violent tendencies. Spider-Man’s black-and-white look has appeared in several adaptations, including video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271">2023’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span>, and 2007’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-movies-ranked-tom-holland-spiderman-1851670709"><em>Spider-Man 3</em> film starring Tobey Maguire</a></span>. It would make a natural addition to <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, one fans are clamoring for, and it would probably sell like hot cakes, but NetEase has yet to announce it. What makes the current situation all the more peculiar is that some of the skins in the game’s upcoming battle pass that <em>have</em> leaked include Symbiote skins for several other characters who are not your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.</p><p>Based on the leaked art posted on X (formerly Twitter) account Rivals_Leaks, we now know that Squirrel Girl, Rocket Raccoon, and Jeff the Land Shark will all be getting Symbiote skins as part of the battle pass. Those might read like gag picks, but they have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Venom_War:_It%27s_Jeff_Vol_1_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some basis in the comics</a></span>, each at some point <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon_(Earth-18197)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being overtaken by a Symbiote</a></span>. With the alien goop suit being an obvious theme this season, it’s only a matter of time before we see Spidey don the fit, right? <em>Right?</em> Possibly! Until we know for sure, however, Spider-Man fans are gonna crash out and/or vibrate with anticipation, if that’s okay with y’all.</p><p>Given how popular the suit is, it wouldn’t surprise me if <em>Marvel Rivals </em>made it a shop skin instead of putting it on the battle pass. That way, people can buy it outright for about twice as much cash. If, somehow, NetEase doesn’t add this skin during the Symbiote-themed Season 3, beginning July 11, I expect the internet to melt. I mean, hey, Spidey’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1939791055991242879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already getting a new skin bundle this week</a></span>, so it’s entirely possible NetEase pushes it further down the pipeline so Peter doesn’t get too greedy.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-symbiote-spider-man-rocket-jeff-1851785527]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rare appears to have become caught up in Microsoft's round of layoffs today, and the developer's long-running project&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>also seems to have been canceled, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>,&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>, which hasn't been heard from in some time (barring a somewhat vague update from Xbox boss Phil Spencer earlier this year), has been shut down. Additionally, employees at Rare are "likely to lose their jobs" (that's VGC's wording, but the publication is citing "people with knowledge of the project").</p>

<p>It's all part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">massive round of layoffs</a> at Microsoft that began earlier today, with&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush&nbsp;</em>studio King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax already affected by job cuts. Other studios, like Rare, were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">widely expected</a> to enter Microsoft's crosshairs as part of these cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=buQfwUTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/everwild-xbox-layoffs-rare.jpg?itok=lFkBDB39 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, according to "people familiar with the project".</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly one of the victims of this layoff wave, which could see upwards of 9,000 employees losing their jobs, it hasn't been without its own troubles in the past as well.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare" rel="nofollow">announced all the way back in 2019</a>&nbsp;with a rather evocative trailer, albeit one that didn't show too much in the way of concrete gameplay.</p>

<p>That would turn out to be a consistent theme with&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em>; another trailer was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-trailer-shown-at-xbox-games-event" rel="nofollow">during the Xbox event in July 2020</a>, and while it was certainly visually striking, it once again failed to show exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would be.</p>

<p>Between then and now, Xbox didn't say much about&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>at all, but rumors swirled that the game's development had essentially been rebooted, suggesting that Rare and Xbox weren't entirely sure in which direction they wanted to take their latest project.</p>




<p>It's hard to say whether&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>would have been granted more of a reprieve were these layoffs not being put into effect. Its lengthy, seemingly troubled development gives the impression of a game that nobody was quite sure about, so it may well have ended up falling by the wayside anyway.</p>

<p>In any case, with&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>now dead, Rare doesn't have another publicly-announced project in the works. Xbox doesn't seem to be shuttering the studio (for now, at least; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">certainly past form in this area</a>), so we'll just have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As with many free-to-play games, <em>Splitgate 2</em> offers multiple in-game currencies. Unfortunately, also like other free-to-play games, it’s a little unclear what each currency does. In particular, the purple Proelium is a little vague on its use.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196918,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So, what exactly are these upgrade tokens used for? And where can you get them? Here’s what you need to know about using the Proelium in your inventory.</p><h2 id="h795088"><a id=""></a>What is Proelium used for?</h2><p>Proelium is used to purchase additional variants and upgrades for cosmetic skins for both the player and weapons. These purchases can be either variants of a given skin, or additional upgrades that give new effects. At the moment, these seem to be mostly limited to skins of Mythic rarity, with some exceptions at lower rarities. You can see if a skin has variants or upgrades on the purchase screen for the cosmetic, or by going to the edit screen for a skin you already own.</p><h2 id="h795089"><a id=""></a>How do you use Proelium?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-recommend-id="image://aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a gun skin in a shop.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After purchasing a Mythic weapon or character cosmetic, right click or press Y/triangle while selecting it in your loadout menu. Once in here, you’ll be able to see the variants and upgrades you can purchase.</p><p>The best example is a cosmetic from the open beta, the Deadly Harvest Jackhammer skin. Once you purchase this, you also will gain access to three additional variants of the skin, which you can unlock for 10 Proelium each. These don’t change the skin drastically, but give it some new colors as a way to further your own expression–and flex that you spent money to get the Mythic skin.</p><p>In addition to variants, you can get upgrades that heighten the cool factor of your new cosmetic for 20 Proelium each. For instance, with the Jackhammer skin, you can get a new tracer for your gun that gives a unique look and sound to every bullet fired, and a death effect that makes your target vanish when they’re defeated.</p><p>Luckily, getting Proelium is the simplest part about the currency! There are two main ways: directly converting Splitcoin into it, or earning it through a battle pass. The Beta Pass offered 70 Proelium for players to earn, for example, though it’s unclear if this will be the case for future ones as well.</p><p>As for the Splitcoin conversion, you can select one of three options:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>40 Proelium for 1,000 Splitcoin</li><li>100 Proelium for 2,000 Splitcoin</li><li>240 Proelium for 4,000 Splitcoin</li></ul><p>With those rates, if you haven’t exhausted the option yet, you’re better off buying the premium battle pass to get Proelium. And even if you have, you are probably better off waiting for the next battle pass and seeing how much Proelium you can get from it.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2 </em>is currently available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-proelium-uses-worth-it-buy-upgrades-cosmeti-1851785508]]></content:encoded>
