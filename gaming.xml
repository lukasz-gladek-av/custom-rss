		<p>Marvel Rivals season 1 has been confirmed officially, and it is called Eternal Night Falls.

<p>The description for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls says, <em>“Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon’s orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures. With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!”</em></p>
<p>Season 1 will start on January 10th at 1AM PST, which is 9AM GMT. Marvel Rivals did launch on December 6th, and it is living up to some of its potential as an entertaining and accessible multiplayer shooter. You can play it for free now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

In a short trailer, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer Net Ease has announced that season 1 begins later this week on January 10th. </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/zATLJ6Cqt0c?si=0AmAYqhdKelPw7p0">According to the trailer</a>, season 1 features the arrival of Dracula who plunges New York City into eternal night by <em>*checks notes*</em> teaming up with Dr. Doom to tamper with the moon’s orbit. (Hey, it’s a comic book game, weird nonsensical stuff is supposed to happen.)  Apparently Dracula has imprisoned Dr. Strange in a pocket dimension and has also unleashed a horde of vampires because messing with the moon just wasn’t enough. </p><p>To fight against this nefarious plot,<em> Rivals</em> will add four new characters to the game’s roster — The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, Mr. Fantastic, and The Thing — the hero collective known as The Fantastic Four. Throughout the week leading up to season’s launch, players will be get a first look at the new heroes and their abilities starting January 7th. The addition also has a bit of synergy with the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072910/marvel-studios-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal"><em>The Fantastic Four</em> movie starring Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby</a> releases in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/27/24207887/fantastic-four-has-a-real-title">July of this year</a>. </p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> appears to be scratching the hero shooter itch reminiscent of the early days of the original <em>Overwatch</em>. Developer Net Ease announced that the game <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1869080172814848471">has surpassed 20 million players</a> shortly after the free-to-play game’s launch in early December. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And he still hasn’t divulged the full extent of his plans, even with a major battle for ruler of Japan possibly on the horizon.</p><p>Safe to say that while season one more or less covered the entirety of James Clavell’s novel, there’s more than enough opportunity for the show’s writers to continue the story and create another award-winning year for one of the best shows of the 2020s.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite clearly being passionate about the idea, Persson was just as eager to share his fears regarding the ways a Minecraft sequel could potentially go wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it," he said. "Saying that, spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. [These are] the things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway, and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even <em>more</em> cash for?"</p><p dir="ltr">Persson added that he'd want any profit made from a potential Minecraft sequel to be "spent for good [things]," adding that despite Minecraft's popularity and success, the game has also taught him a lot about failure. "Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed," he wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Before signing off, Perrson stated that he had no intention to "sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing [with Minecraft] and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft sh*ttification about."</p><p dir="ltr">"I respect them for doing that," Persson said of Microsoft, which purchased Minecraft in 2014. "It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me."</p><p dir="ltr">In the years since the acquisition, Microsoft has expanded the franchise with spin-offs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/">Minecraft Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-dungeons/">Minecraft Dungeons</a>. As for the possibility of a sequel, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in the wake of the 2014 buyout that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-minecraft-buyout-possibility-of-mi/1100-6423159/">focused first and foremost on improving the original game</a>, rather than looking toward a sequel. In 2015, Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson said there were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/">"no discussions [happening] about Minecraft 2 at the moment,"</a> but neither Microsoft nor Mojang have ever said that a sequel was entirely off the table.</p><p>Persson hasn't yet shared any glimpses of his current work with players, so there's no telling what a Minecraft 2 might look like, though one imagines it would share its predecessor's cube-covered art style. In addition to a potential playable sequel, Minecraft fans also have a block-based blockbuster to look forward to, with A Minecraft Movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-trailer-for-a-minecraft-movie-provides-a-deeper-look-at-the-block-based-blockbuster/1100-6527875/">set to hit theaters in April</a>.</p>

It wasn’t a huge hit compared to other <em>CoD </em>games, not least because the Vita itself wasn’t a big seller. But despite the Vita being a portable console from over a decade ago and<em> Black Ops: Declassified</em> being a oddball spin-off from 2012, there are still enough people playing the FPS in 2025 that you can reportedly boot up a Vita right now and find a match in seconds. </p><p>On January 4, PlayStation content creator Radec posted on Twitter that they were able to boot up a PS Vita and find matches “instantly” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet went viral</a></span>, likely because a lot of people were surprised to hear that <em>Declassified</em> was still popular and being played in 2025. And I bet some people were just shocked to hear about a PS Vita <em>Call of Duty</em> even existing. </p><p>Radec isn’t the only person reporting this. In the replies to the tweet you can find other players sharing stories of how they just recently booted up the game on their own PS Vita and also found matches quickly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another player shared how they found matches quickly</a></span> in <em>Declassified </em>in November, saying it only took about 20 seconds to find a full lobby. </p><p>“Legit. Like last month I connected my Vita to my mobile hotspot and checked <em>Black Ops Declassified </em>multiplayer and there were almost full lobbies with all kinds of players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another user in response to Radec’s tweet</a></span>. “The best part about the whole experience was there were no hackers. Just people who wanna unwind and play.”</p><p>Declassified isn’t the only old <em>CoD</em> game still being played in 2025. You can still boot up most <em>Call of Duty </em>games released on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS4 and find players instantly. Some people just don’t want to move on. Be warned though, as someone who has done this, the people still playing these older <em>Call of Duty</em> games are veterans who know the maps and weapons incredibly well and you’ll likely get stomped over and over. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft is continuing to expand Xbox Game Pass, with new LG Smart TVs coming later this year set to support the service via Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox App on their new LG TV, no Xbox required. A select few games, around 50, will also be streamable via the new LG TVs for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who own them. Microsoft announced the ability to stream owned games in November, with titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">NBA 2K25, Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and others supporting the feature. </p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those looking to stream Xbox Game Pass titles without an actual console or PC can do so via their phone, Amazon Fire TV, or on newer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-support-coming-to-2021-samsung-smart-tvs/1100-6509215/" data-ref-id="1100-6509215">Samsung Smart TVs</a>. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> it will reveal more details about how the service will work on LG Tvs "in the coming months." It's currently unclear if support for the service will eventually come to some older LG TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Game Pass heading to LG TVs comes as part of Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This is an Xbox" marketing campaign</a>, where the company has looked to expand the idea of what it means to play on Xbox by highlighting how players can play "Xbox" on their PC, phones, or even TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a message Microsoft has been using for a while now. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">the goal was to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but that didn't necessarily mean selling more consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-ps5%E2%80%99s-dualsense-but-for-xbox.1075095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hyperkin has revealed a new Competitor wired gamepad for Xbox, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it looks rather familiar. In fact, it’s basically a PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a> controller remade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperkin absolutely plays up to this, with the announcement blurb saying, “If you prefer PS5’s DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Competitor comes with the striking two-tone white and black design of the DualSense controller or in an all-black version, but absent the rectangular touchpad, has a bit more of an X-Men vibe as the white panels continue in to meet a white and black Xbox button. Everything else looks very DualSense as well, from the D-pad design (which we really hope nails the feel and muted sound of the PlayStation D-pad), to the analogue stick placement, and the shoulder buttons and triggers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a pro controller, so there are back buttons, and on the whole, the controller does look a bit chunkier than the DualSense – perhaps just from the flattened bottom below the sticks, which Sony has more moulded.</p>

<p>At this time there’s no details on pricing or availability, but if you’re a PlayStation fan suffering in the land of Xbox, this could be for you. The symmetrical analogue sticks will do a huge amount of the heavy lifting on that front, though it’s a shame that this is a wired controller and not wireless.</p>
<p>Hyperkin has made a lot of headlines over the years for their recreations of historic Xbox controllers, updating them for modern machines. That started with a recreation of the ‘<a href="https://hyperkin.com/hyperkin-duke-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-20th-anniversary-limited-edition-black-officially-licensed-by-xbox.html">Duke</a>‘ controller from the original Xbox, continued on with a ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/23/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-xbox-360-controller/">Xenon</a>‘ recreation of the Xbox 360 gamepad, and most recently they revived the smaller ‘<a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyperkin-duchess-wired-controller-white-officially-licensed-by-xbox">Duchess</a>‘ controller that Microsoft made to cater to smaller hands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-coming-to-lg-smart-tvs.1075092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG and Xbox have announced that they're teaming up in order to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG smart TVs via an all-new Xbox app integration.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/01/lg-and-xbox-partner-to-expand-cloud-gaming-experience-on-lg-smart-tvs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on its official website</a>, LG says you'll soon be able to access the Xbox app via its new Gaming Portal, although it also notes that said Gaming Portal's availability "can vary per TV model", so you'll probably have to pick up a newer smart TV to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to own one of the LG TVs that supports the Gaming Portal, you can look forward to accessing "hundreds of games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming, though you'll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to take advantage of that feature as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=92ELIiOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=WgxzCLmH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>LG and Xbox are teaming up to bring the latter's Cloud Gaming service to LG smart TVs.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to access a select few games that aren't included with Game Pass but that you can stream via the cloud nonetheless, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>The app will be powered by LG's webOS, and it sounds like it might be just one of several cloud gaming apps available via the Gaming Portal; LG says the service provides a "comprehensive overview with an app list that includes cloud gaming apps, webOS app games", and more.</p>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is, of course, already available on Xbox consoles and web browsers, as well as in several other places, including Samsung's own smart TV line.</p>

<p>It's the cornerstone of Xbox's "This Is an Xbox" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a>, which seeks to paint any device capable of running Cloud Gaming via a browser or the desktop Xbox app as an Xbox device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=qEn7xTy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=wV8p4zoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you say so, guys.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">recently announced</a> it would allow players to purchase games directly from its Android app after a court ruling found in Epic's favor against Google.</p>

<p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer also confirmed that an Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">handheld device</a> is currently being prototyped, although it's likely years away.</p>

<p>It's also unlikely you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on that device if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">producer's comments</a> are anything to go by, although hey, maybe you'll be able to stream it via the cloud by then.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a> teased for weeks now, you feel it’s all coming to a head in Eternal Night Falls. The reveal also strongly insinuates Dracula as a villain: “The Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. <strong>Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!</strong>“</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it’s just the Fantastic Four, or if Doctor Doom and Dracula are out for blood too.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaks</h2>



<p>Popular leaks suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a> is another character set to join the fray, and a host of <strong>buffs &amp; nerfs</strong> to key heroes are coming.</p>



<h3 id="h-ultron">Ultron</h3>



<p>A bunch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals leaked character rumors</a> are in the wild, but Ultron could be sooner rather than later. Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> thinks “Ultron releases Season 1 and he’s a Strategist.” Additionally, their <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869869444455117276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869869444455117276%7Ctwgr%5E1bb1dd9231dc5324b962d40043263ee880ea27c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fmarvel-rivals%2Fmarvel-rivals-season-1-update-3022179%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> also has a full look at <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869868212927524964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultron’s abilities and difficulty rating</a> of <strong>Two Stars</strong>.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick look at the characters expected to be reworked in Season 1—for better or worse.</p>



<h4 id="h-buffs">Buffs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>

          <p>Last month, we asked readers to donate to a couple of good causes in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">our 2024 Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>. And boy, did you deliver. With the drive now complete and the donations all tallied, we can report that Ars Technica readers <strong>gave an incredible $39,047.66</strong>&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> in this year's drive. That doesn't set a new record, but it nearly matches last year's total and raises our lifetime Ars Charity Drive donation haul since 2007 to <strong>over</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$540,000</strong>. Well done, Arsians!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 T239 could be an 8nm chip, and while this could make good performance and battery life a challenge, there's a good chance this process node won't significantly impact the system.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the leaked system's motherboard, focusing on the T239 SoC, as most of the other components found on it aren't particularly interesting. While it is currently difficult to pinpoint the exact size of the chip due to the angled picture, Digital Foundry's experts think that the Samsung 8nm process node was more likely used for the chip over other rumored process nodes for a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, the chip is somewhat of an offshoot of the T234 chip, which uses the Samsung 8nm process node. Additionally, NVIDIA Ampere architecture was designed for this process node, and porting it to a different process node like 4nm would be a waste of time, as it would have made more sense simply to go with the Lovelace architecture, which was built with 4nm in mind. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">A Samsung 5nm process node</a> could still be possible, but it would still require porting Ampere over to a different process node. Also, the Samsung 8nm process node is quite cheap, as it has never been extremely popular, and Samsung likely doesn't have that many customers for it right now, so its low cost would definitely fit Nintendo's approach.</p>
<p>Even if the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by a Samsung 8nm chip, the process node may end up not being as big an issue as many are speculating. While 8nm is not particularly power-efficient, and achieving good performance and battery life on it may be a challenge, all the current power measurements are likely way off the mark, as they are based on the T234 chip, which is much bigger than the T239 and requires a certain amount of power even with reduced clock speeds. Additionally, the T239 chip may have begun development as some sort of offshoot of the much bigger and more power-hungry T234 chip, but the two chips have been designed by different teams, have different CPUs, and the Nintendo Switch 2 chip has some additional features, such as a file decompression block required for fast loading and asset management, so it's not a cut-down version of the chip used in the automotive segment. Having likely been designed from scratch on the 8nm process node with certain power-efficiency goals in mind, which are suggested by the small battery cavity seen in the leaked motherboard, there's a very good chance that the chip's process node is not going to impact the system in any significant way.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard leak was only the first one to surface online in the first few days of 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Yesterday</a>, pictures showcasing the new Joy-Con controller emerged online, and some of the additions from the original controller suggest that the controller could be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. Will this be the new gimmick of the system? Hopefully, it won't take much longer to get the answer to this question and every other that fans have been asking themselves for a few months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor.1075050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, there have been a variety of PS5-style Xbox controllers, none of them causing quite as much of a stir as the Hyperkin controller. During the<a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/"> CES 2025</a>, Hyperkin announced a brand-new Xbox controller, which is called "The Competitor" and seems very similar to that of the PlayStation 5 DualSense. Much like the DualSense, the thumbstick on the left has now been moved down to be parallel to the right thumbstick, and the D-pad is moved above to replicate the design of the DualSense. While it has an Xbox-style design in terms of pattern, the colors are that of the DualSense, in a classic white and black design.</p>
<p>Hyperkin is well known for making controllers and other accessories that have a retro vibe, with many of the controllers they created being similar to the original Xbox controllers. <a href="https://hyperkin.com/full-product-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their website</a> is a safe haven for those who want a hit of nostalgia, as they have items that pertain to every type of popular console on the market. This ranges from the PlayStation One to the PS Vita and even a Nintendo DS, for example.</p>
<p>Compared to other controllers on the market, the brand-new Hyperkin controller is a wired controller that can be used on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. While PC gamers commonly use Xbox controllers over DualSense controllers, this new Hyperkin controller contains something that is incredibly beneficial to the longevity of a controller. That is the Hall Effect sticks. For those just hearing about these for the first time, Hall Effect Sticks use non-contact magnetic sensors to detect movement, which should prove to be beneficial in making sure that the thumbstick lasts longer than that of a typical Xbox controller.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't many details about this new Hyperkin Controller other than the name of it and a trailer that was released on the IGN YouTube channel. Here, you can see the aesthetic they went for with the controller and the sleekness of the design. By the looks of the trailer, it seems you can either get the controller in black and white, or just fully black, depending on your preference in aesthetic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The video is only short and doesn't provide any details about the Competitor, but it's very obvious that they have taken heavy inspiration from the DualSense, even in the styling of the D-Pad and the buttons.</p>
<p>Those who have seen the controller now wish it had the option to be wireless, but that is proprietary tech belonging to Microsoft, and thus, it's not possible for Hyperkin to do so without getting permission from the company. While some are delighted with this new option, there is also an outcry from those who dislike using symmetrical thumbsticks, with some even saying that it will cause issues in the hands later on down the line.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sign of how much this Hyperkin controller will cost, but we will keep you updated when the information arrives.</p>
<p>Will you be getting The Competitor controller by Hyperkin?</p>

<p>As promised, Marvel Rivals released their Season 1 trailer today, January 6. We now know that Eternal Night Falls and the Fantastic 4 will arrive on January 10, 2025, at 1 AM PST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> is, unfortunately, a cinematic one, so we do not get to see gameplay for the Fantastic 4. However, we do learn about the overarching plot. With the arrival of Season 1, darkness will cover New York, with Doctor Strange trapped in an Entangled Astral Plane. Dracula and Doctor Doom are making their moves, disrupting the moon’s orbit and releasing an army of vampires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as things start looking grim for the heroes, we see the new additions to the Marvel Rivals roster take charge and protect the work against the evil forces of Dracula. On January 10, we will see the likes of Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing join the battle in Marvel Rivals Season 1. If luck is on our side, we might receive a gameplay trailer showcasing these characters in action before they arrive later this week.</p>



<p>In other news, recent leaks have claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost and Modok</a> are coming to the game. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about loot boxes</a> have leaked online. What are your thoughts on Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>CES 2025 has kicked off, and amidst all of the new tech reveals, Hyperkin has unveiled a new Xbox and PC controller that appears to borrow heavily from the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller. Dubbed the Competitor, this is a wired controller that features some premium hardware inside of it, like Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers. Official pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed, but we'll update this post with preorder links as soon as Hyperkin makes those details public.</p><p>Like the DualSense, the Competitor features a similar layout of face buttons, symmetrical analog sticks, and a familiar placement of face buttons (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ces-2025-hyperkin-unveils-dualsense-style-xbox-controller-called-the-competitor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). The D-pad is also heavily influenced by the DualSense with its transparent buttons and placement, and for extras, two additional inputs on the gamepad's rear can be found. There'll be two variants available for purchase when it launches: a regular black Competitor controller and one with white face-plates to create a two-color tone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6rko8BbWgw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the Competitor looks like a DualSense controller, it remains to be seen if it'll <em>feel</em> like one. The overall ergonomics look almost identical to its primary inspiration, but the DualSense does feature nuanced haptic feedback features that aren't present in an Xbox controller.</p><p>While it can be used on a PC as well, so can a DualSense controller. The caveat here is that accessing DualSense features in a PlayStation game ported to a PC typically requires the controller to be tethered to your PC via USB-C, whereas on a PS5 console, you can still experience these features wirelessly. Anyone looking for something with more of a retro flair can also check out a previous collaboration between Hyperkin and Xbox, as the peripherals manufacturer revived the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic Duke controller for modern Xbox systems</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, NetEase Games teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">the debut of the Fantastic Four</a>, the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a>. Now, the trailer for Marvel Rivals Season 1 has arrived, and it reveals that Marvel's first family of superheroes are facing an unexpected battle with the Lord of the Vampires, Count Dracula. It also appears that the FF may be among the few heroes left who can oppose him.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2ea9O95bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xg2ea9O95bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, Dracula has personally taken Dr. Strange out of the picture. More alarmingly, Avengers Tower has fallen, and the familiar A logo on the side of the building has been turned into a V. Each member of the Fantastic Four is also showcased as they push back against Dracula's influence, but the FF won't have to hold back the darkness alone.</p><p>The story seems similar to Marvel's recently concluded Blood Hunt crossover, which also left the world enshrouded by darkness as vampires attempted to take over. In the game, Dracula and Doctor Doom achieved this result by disrupting the moon's orbit. New York City has already fallen, and the remaining heroes will stand "together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science."</p><p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10. And while Dracula doesn't appear to be playable, the FF will be added to the Marvel Rivals roster with more characters coming in the future.</p><p>Before the launch of Season 1, NetEase is giving away a free in-game chibi Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tejo-valorant%E2%80%99s-newest-agent-has-been-revealed.1075011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Riot Games and VALORANT released information regarding the latest agent to be joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">incredibly popular title</a>. Their name is Tejo, and he is a veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia who has a variety of abilities revolving around ballistics. If you want to see Tejo in action, make sure to check out the gameplay trailer below where you can see everything he has to offer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tejo Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRuRID5JoQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, the commentary regarding the latest agent for VALORANT seems to be pretty positive, with many saying that he feels like he is a mix of pre-existing agents rolled into one as a powerful killer.</p>
<p>Like every other agent, he has four abilities which includes his Ultimate. These abilities are all showcased in the trailer above. However, we're going to run you through the abilities and what they do, so you can get confirmation on their functionality.</p>
<p>First up is Special Delivery, where you can equip a sticky grenade and fire it at your desired position. The grenade will then stick to the surface and explode after a short time, where any targets caught in the blast will become concussed. You can also alt fire the grenade so that it launches with a single bounce, rather than sticking in place.</p>
<p>Next is the Stealth Drone. You can equip and fire the drone to throw it forward, where you can then take control of its movement. Firing again allows you to trigger a pulse from the drone that Suppresses and Reveals any enemies that were hit by the pulse.</p>
<p>After that is the Guided Salvo, which allows Tejo to equip an AR targeting system. Firing allows you to select two locations on the map, with alt fire launching missiles on the target locations, and detonating as soon as they get to the planned spot.</p>
<p>Finally, Tejo's ultimate. He can utilize a tactical strike targeting map, where he can choose the origin point of the strike and then fire to unleash a heavy wave of explosions in his chosen destination.</p>
<p>However, Tejo is not the only thing coming to VALORANT, as a brand-new content type is being added to the game. This content is called Flex, where players can begin collecting handheld objects to show off their flair in battle. This is similar to the Spray Wheel, and can be equipped via Collections. As Flex is new <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game</a>, players will receive a free Flex, with a second one becoming available in the upcoming Act I Battlepass.</p>

She provides a similar rewind technique to both Black Panther and Psylocke that returns them to the position they were in five seconds earlier. If they took any damage within that period, they’ll receive some partially healed health too. Overall, this ability is a great tool to increase their survival chances.</p><p>Psylocke arguably gets the better end of the bargain here as she’s slower than Black Panther and has 100 less health. Although her Psi-Blade Dash and Psychic Stealth can lead to a quick exit, she’s still in danger within big open areas. Magik’s Dimensional Shortcut provides a new way to escape sticky situations and maybe get some health back too.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-recommend-id="image://5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-recommend-id="image://5aa9264af9e7fc431e3fc020420d944e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue wave radiates off Luna Snow, healing her allies and knocking a couple of enemies away." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Luna Snow is a fun character to use, but you’re going to need good aim as her kit mostly revolves around healing and damaging projectile attacks.

It will also knock enemies back with a little bit of damage while inflicting a slowing effect for two seconds. Whether you’re using it to heal multiple teammates, aid in an escape, or pin down some enemies for some eliminations, this is one of the most versatile Team-Up Abilities so far. Using it can make that MVP or SVP title a lot more attainable for a healer like Luna.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-recommend-id="image://42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-recommend-id="image://42fd3b6b8db04c115a7097c2e2a6140d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon shoots at a Galacta Bot while riding Groot’s shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Groot is a fun tanky character on his own, but for some of us it’s hard to imagine him without also thinking of a furry raccoon creature riding on his shoulder with a giant gun. The Planet X Pals Team-Up brings that imagery to life by allowing either Rocket Raccoon or Jeff The Land Shark to attach onto Groot’s shoulder. They can then attack from the position while enjoying a damage reduction.</p><p>Out of all the Team-Ups, this one lends itself to feeling the most symbiotic. Groot can help his smaller friends charge into battle more easily, with both picking off enemies as they go. At the same time, Groot’s passengers can provide easy heals straight from his shoulder. I highly encourage jumping onto your next tree man teammate if you want a more active role during combat.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-recommend-id="image://3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-recommend-id="image://3726d5b1a172aa56d9e86120927096e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Namor stares at a Frost Spawn he summoned, which is blue and has a cracked ice aura underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Some heroes can be a part of multiple Team-Ups. Luna Snow can provide both Jeff the Land Shark and Namor with icy versions of an existing ability. The former temporarily modifies his Aqua Burst to slow enemies, while the latter gets a Frozen Spawn that can slow enemies.</p><p>Slowing down your targets is always a fantastic option given how hectic <em>Marvel Rivals</em> matches can get. Both characters play better with these additions, but Namor might edge out for some cooler applications. Just like his regular Monstro Spawn, his Frozen Spawn can also be enhanced. Giving him turrets that slow down enemies and can briefly increase their firing rate is a game-changer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-recommend-id="image://b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-recommend-id="image://b7805b41c9aa5666c470bd49b1b9ae68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Black Widow aims at a group of blue afterimages left behind by a Galacta Bot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A Team-Up between two sniper characters is a deadly alliance.
