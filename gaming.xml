<figure data-uuid="692a8a4c594a5"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/692a8a4c594a5/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">financial data</a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, confirming that the Switch 2 has now sold an astonishing <strong>17.37 million units</strong> since launch in June 2025. <em>17.37 million</em><em>!</em></p>
<p>If you remember, Nintendo increased its forecast for Switch 2 sales back in November 2025 from 15 million to 19 million. Honestly, that seemed a tad overly-ambitious to us at the time, but it seems the Switch 2 will have absolutely no trouble smashing through its target by the time the fiscal year is out.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Nintendo has also showcased a rather lovely graphic to demonstrate how fast the Switch 2 is selling compared to the Switch. Note that this has the Switch 2 at 15 million units, but specific figures in Nintendo's dedicated unit sales page has it at 17.37 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="30e5a02f32d62"><a title="Sales Chart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30e5a02f32d62/sales-chart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is also sitting pretty at a total of <strong>37.93 million</strong> units, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> taking the lead at 14.03 units shifted. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> managed a total of 4.25 million, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> performed admirably at 1.76 million. Curiously, Nintendo has opted to make no mention of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Hmm, troubling.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the money is going up, up, and up. Net sales for the nine months of FY26 so far are up by 99.3% at a total of 1,905.8 billion yen, while operating profit is up 21.3% at 300.3 billion yen. There are no new changes to the hardware or software forecast for the remainder of the year, and Nintendo has singled out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> as games to watch out for in February and March.</p>
<p>We'll definitely look forward to those, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition</a> and the currently undated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>.

<p>If you haven't already seen our own review and score, we gave this reimagined release nine out of ten stars, calling it the "most fun version" of this particular entry yet, and well worth a look if you're a fan of "high-quality, old-school JRPG" action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined still encapsulates much of what makes Dragon Quest VII resonant, but with every possible edge sanded off. It succeeds at streamlining a lengthy adventure at the expense of player discovery and friction. Besides being able to reach the credits more quickly, I find it difficult to declare this version as an improvement on what came before."</p>

<p>"Dragon Quest VII Reimagined delivers a better-paced version of this 26-year-old classic while retaining its signature charm, but it also goes too far with some of its changes, sanding down the experience for newer players at the expense of the challenge and discovery"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is a beautifully designed turn-based RPG that is much more approachable to new players than the 3DS remake in 2016, but it may leave fans of earlier versions feeling slighted...Even though there aren’t any glaring problems with this remake, it never felt as satisfying to play as the HD-2D games or Dragon Quest 11, so be prepared for a noticeably different experience compared to those RPGs."</p>

In its latest earnings release, Nintendo reports that the Nintendo Switch has, as of December 31, 2025, sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">155.37 million units</a> since its launch in 2017, compared to 154.02 million units for the 2004 Nintendo DS.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings">Nintendo reported</a> that the Switch and DS were neck and neck. We expected the holiday sales period would see the Switch surpass the DS, even with Nintendo announcing that primary development would focus on the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">Nintendo previously said</a> that it would continue to sell the original Switch “while taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration.”</p><p>Nintendo has to keep selling the Switch if it wants to dethrone Sony’s PlayStation 2 as the best-selling video game console of all time. The PlayStation 2, discontinued in January 2013, sold <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">more than 160 million units</a> over its 13-year lifespan.</p><p>Demand for the Switch 2 accelerated over the holidays, with Nintendo reporting 7.01 million units sold during the quarter covering October through December, compared to 4.54 million units in the previous quarter. In total, the Switch 2 has now sold 17.37 million units since it launched in June 2025, taking less than a year to surpass the Wii U’s 13.7 million lifetime sales.</p><p>The Switch 2 launch has helped Nintendo to drive a 51 percent increase in net profit over the first nine months of FY26, reaching ¥358.86 billion (about $2.31 billion). Net sales almost doubled during the same period, jumping to ¥1.906 trillion (about $12.2 billion) compared to ¥956.2 billion ($6.1 billion) last year. Looking ahead, Nintendo maintains its forecast to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by the end of this financial year.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/872768/nintendo-earnings-switch-best-selling-console-ds]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="40062ef98b2c1"><a title="Magical Craft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40062ef98b2c1/magical-craft.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Imagineer</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Imagineer and developer syn Sophia (the team behind Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_2_-_fashion_forward">Style Savvy</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/nintendo_presents_new_style_boutique_3_-_styling_star">New Style Boutique</a> series) announced a new Switch dressmaking game called <strong>Magical Craft</strong>. It's already been released in Japan late last year, and now, in an update, an ESRB listing has surfaced.</p>
<p>No local release has been announced just yet, but if this rating is any indication, it seems we could be getting some news soon. The developer is the same Japanese team behind the 2023 Marvelous Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fashion_dreamer">Fashion Dreamer</a>. It also more recently helped Imagineer with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fitness_boxing_3_your_personal_trainer">Fitness Boxing 3</a>.</p>
<p>In this title, you gather fabrics, motif patterns and other items to make dresses, with "over 100,000 possible designs". To complete each dress, you'll play through mini-games featuring four kinds of sewing magic, and your villagers can then wear your creations.</p>
<p>Here's an official description about the game's protagonist and story (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dressmaking-adventure-game-magical-craft-neko-to-mahou-no-dress-announced-for-switch">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The story unfolds in the tranquil village of Frune. The protagonist, a young girl named Lilia, begins her journey as a dressmaker, using the “sewing magic” she inherited from her grandmother. As she fulfills requests from the villagers and works toward becoming a legendary dressmaker, her everyday life of dressmaking begins."</p>

<p>If we hear any updates about a local release, we'll let you know.</p>

<figure data-uuid="06fa2bb960801"><a title="Dispatch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/06fa2bb960801/dispatch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: AdHoc Studio</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of the superhero workplace comedy game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> on Switch and Switch 2 hasn't exactly panned out as expected.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed it, there has been a lot of back-and-forth over the past week about censorship in the Nintendo versions of the game. It resulted in the developer AdHoc Studio sharing multiple comments, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">Nintendo issued a formal statement</a>.</p>
<p>The previous update from the studio said the plan was to "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/people-have-a-right-to-be-pd-dispatch-dev-says-it-intends-to-address-at-least-some-censored-switch-content">address at least some of the censored content</a>" in the Switch and Switch 2 releases going forward. Now, <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on">GoNintendo</a> has asked about the possibility of a "fully uncensored" physical version of the game on Nintendo platforms, but apparently, this won't be happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GoNintendo:</strong> Unfortunately the answer isn’t one we hoped for. Our point of contact told us there is <em>“no possibility for a physical version to be released without the adjusted content.”</em> They also went on to say that the discussion isn’t <em>“currently relevant as there are no announcements regarding a physical release at this time.”</em> That is very much true, but you might remember that in our interview with Natalie Herman, Lead Producer on Dispatch, we asked about the potential for a physical release. Herman responded by saying, <em>“Let’s just say we’ve dreamed of Dispatch in a shiny red case. We have a lot of physical media fans on our team.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same site also asked about the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">singular worldwide release discussion</a>" doing the rounds online and reportedly got the following response back from AdHoc's PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are any other significant developments or comments made, we'll provide an update. You can find out more about Dispatch and the censored content in the Switch versions of the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review and previous stories</a> here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As you explore the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Poolside Cave</strong> in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> to help the Roamers complete their trial, you will come across a cryptic riddle in the cave's Underground Level 2 map : <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">“A chest that rests in a wintry bath, Will show us the Almighty's path.”</em></p>



<p>While your instinct in any RPG is to open every chest you see, this room is a minefield. Most of the treasure chests here are either completely empty or, far worse, are actually <strong>Canniboxes</strong> in disguise. These monsters are notorious for their high critical hit rate and their ability to cast <strong>Whack</strong> (the series' dreaded instant-death spell).</p>



<p><span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">In my first playthrough, I learned the hard way that fighting these early on is a recipe for disaster,&nbsp; especially if you're playing at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, so I highly recommend going straight for the&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"wintry bath"&nbsp;</em>and ignoring the decoys.</span></p>

<h3 id="h-finding-the-wintry-bath-chest"><strong>Finding the "Wintry Bath" Chest</strong></h3>



<p>To solve the puzzle and avoid a confrontation with a Cannibox, you need to head to the <strong>eastern side of the map</strong>. You will find a group of <strong>two chests</strong> sitting near a pool of water.</p>

<p>As soon as you interact with it, you will hear a distinct <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">rumbling noise</strong>. This is the signal that the puzzle has been solved and the path forward has opened.</p>

<p>After the rumbling has ceased, a new <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">staircase</strong> will have opened up on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Western</strong> side of the map.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/</link>

			<p><strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> introduces a level of flexibility never before seen in the series by offering three distinct difficulty presets: <strong>Easy Going</strong>, <strong>Happy Medium</strong>, and <strong>Tough Going</strong>. These roughly correspond to your traditional <em>Easy</em>, <em>Normal</em>, and <em>Hard</em> modes.</p>



<p>While these presets are a good starting point, the "reimagined" experience allows you to adjust every parameter individually, even during the game (<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Main Menu, Settings, Difficulty Level</strong>). After extensive testing, I have found that the default <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Happy Medium</strong> can still feel a bit too simple for both series veterans and those accustomed to RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>To achieve a playthrough that rewards strategy without becoming a tedious grind, I recommend a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Custom Balanced</strong> setup.</p>

<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Setting</strong></td><td><strong>Selection</strong></td><td><strong>Why it Works</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Damage Dealt</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Avoids making enemies feel like "damage sponges."</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Experience Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Maintains the game's native progression curve.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proficiency Earned</strong></td><td><strong>Normal</strong></td><td>Keeps Vocation leveling steady and rewarding.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gold Acquired</strong></td><td><strong>More</strong></td><td>Reduces early-game poverty and increases gear options.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Strength</strong></td><td><strong>Strong</strong></td><td><strong>Essential</strong> to keep the Vocation system relevant.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Monster Activity</strong></td><td><strong>Monsters Attack</strong></td><td>Keeps the tension high during field exploration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Restore HP after Battle</strong></td><td><strong>Don't Restore</strong></td><td>Preserves the classic resource-management loop.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-why-these-settings">Why These Settings?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-dealt-normal"><strong>Damage Dealt: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>Reducing the damage your party deals has one unfortunate side effect: it prolongs battles with no tangible benefit to strategy.</p>



<p>I tested the difference between <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Normal</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Less</em> damage against two early-game Vicious enemies: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Hammerhood</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ballymolly Region</strong>) and the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vicious Bodkin Archer</strong> (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Emberdale Region</strong>). There was zero difference in the strategy required; I simply had to spend more turns using <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Healing Herbs</em> to conserve MP. It wasn't more fun—only more tedious.</p>



<h3 id="h-experience-amp-proficiency-normal"><strong>Experience &amp; Proficiency: Normal</strong></h3>



<p>The game is already quite generous with <strong>EXP</strong> and <strong>Proficiency Points</strong>. During my testing, I never felt the need to grind, as the game's balance is handled differently than traditional <em>Dragon Quest</em> games. Keeping these at <em>Normal</em> ensures you stay at the intended power level for the story without inadvertently out-leveling the content.</p>



<h3 id="h-gold-acquired-more"><strong>Gold Acquired: More</strong></h3>



<p>This comes down to personal preference, but <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are notoriously stingy with gold. While I understand you aren't meant to buy out every shop immediately, having more financial freedom early on makes the game significantly more enjoyable. It allows you to experiment with different gear setups rather than being locked into a single "optimal" purchase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Boss-Fight-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This difficulty settings made my first playthrough very enjoyable without making the experience overly frustrating</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-monster-strength-strong"><strong>Monster Strength: Strong</strong></h3>



<p>Because <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> is balanced differently than the original PlayStation or 3DS versions, the base game is generally quite easy. Anything lower than <strong>Strong</strong> results in combat encounters becoming a "walk in the park."</p>



<p>If you want to actually engage with the <strong>Vocation System</strong> and avoid steamrolling bosses and Elite enemies, setting Monster Strength to <strong>Strong</strong> is the only way to ensure the game's mechanics actually matter.</p>



<h3 id="h-restore-hp-after-battle-don-t-restore"><strong>Restore HP after Battle: Don't Restore</strong></h3>



<p>Setting this to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Don't Restore</strong> is vital for maintaining the survival aspect that defines the series. When HP is automatically restored, the tension during dungeon exploration completely vanishes, as every individual battle exists in a vacuum.</p>



<p>By keeping this setting <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OFF</strong>, you preserve the classic resource-management loop of the series which forces you to make choices in regards to items and spending MPs to heal your party or save them for other skills.</p>



<h3 id="h-bonus-setting-objective-marker-display-off">Bonus Setting -  Objective Marker Display: Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Objective-Marker-Off-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Turn off the Objective Marker Display to preserve the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined great sense of discovery</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of every <em>Dragon Quest</em> title is the sense of <strong>discovery</strong>. This is even more vital in <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, where the core of the experience is witnessing how the world’s islands have changed between the <em>Past</em> and the <em>Present</em>.</p>



<p>Having the marker constantly active conditions your experience, making it feell like it’s on rails. By turning the marker off (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Main Menu</strong>, then <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">System</strong>, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Screen Settings</strong>,) you are encouraged to look around the world map and villages and interact with NPCs, who not only provide the clues you need to progress but also flesh out the world with flavor text and lore. This organic exploration makes the game world feel alive, ultimately making your journey far more enjoyable than simply following an icon on a map.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-results">The Results</h3>



<p>By combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Strong</strong> monsters with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">More</strong> gold, you create a game that is tactically demanding but allows you the resources to meet those challenges. It’s the perfect "Sweet Spot" for your first journey into this beautiful world.</p>

			<p>Although it streamlines many of its most challenging elements to be more welcoming than the PlayStation original, <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> can still be a massive undertaking for newcomers that may have some trouble getting into the game and enjoying it right from the beginning.</p>



<p>To maximize your understanding of the early game, and thus its enjoyment, we have put together a list of beginners' tips that are sure to help you enjoy <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> more, especially if this is your first time putting the fragments of the forgotten past back together again.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere" data-level="2">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</a></li><li><a href="#h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely" data-level="2">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</a></li><li><a href="#h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies" data-level="2">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</a></li><li><a href="#h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day" data-level="2">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</a></li><li><a href="#h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense" data-level="2">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-always-talk-to-everyone-and-search-everywhere">Always Talk to Everyone and Search Everywhere!</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Mini-Medals-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore the world thoroughly to discover all sorts of secrets</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Although the experience has been tweaked to be more welcoming,&nbsp;<em><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong></em>&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>&nbsp;game through and through, which puts the same emphasis on exploration as it does on turn-based combat.</span> As such, <strong>every time</strong> you reach a new island or discover a new village, make absolutely sure to talk to every NPC, search every closet and drawer, and smash every urn and barrel before you do anything else.</p>



<p>This isn't just to discover more gear and items that can make you save some gold and <strong>Mini Medals</strong> (which can be exchanged for rewards in <strong>Estard Castle</strong>), but this is also a tip to enhance your enjoyment of the story. </p>



<p>The true beauty of this game lies in the small details and the connection between the past and the present of an island, which the main story often glosses over, giving you a much deeper connection to the world you are working so hard to restore.</p>



<h2 id="h-optimize-combat-pacing-with-fight-wisely">Optimize Combat Pacing with "Fight Wisely"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Fight-Wisely-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Fight Wisely" is a great auto-battle option to improve combat pacing</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although <strong><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong> addresses the high random encounter rate of older games by making enemies visible on the field, you will still be fighting many enemies during your adventure. To make random battles snappier and considerably faster, consider using the <strong>"Fight Wisely"</strong> Tactics option for all your characters, which you can assign at the start of every battle by pressing the <strong>Triangle / Y / X</strong> buttons.</p>



<p>This auto-combat option is based on the principle of taking down enemies as efficiently as possible. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Fight Wisely"</strong> on, characters will also heal when needed using either magic or items, making it a much more reliable option than <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Show No Mercy."</strong> During regular combat encounters, however, make sure to <strong>turn off the When Worked Up, Use Let Loose Immediately option</strong> by pressing Triangle / Y / X in the Tactics menu to avoid needlessly wasting the powerful Let Loose skills.</p>



<p>If you wish to speed up battles further, also consider changing the battle speed to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fast</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ultra Fast</strong>. While combat animations are great to look at, over the dozens of hours it takes to complete the game, they will grow old, believe me.</p>



<h2 id="h-hunt-for-gold-sparkles-and-vicious-enemies">Hunt for Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Gold-Sparkle-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Focus on Gold Sparkles and Vicious Enemies if you are not inclined towards exploring the world to still reap some great benefits</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you're a player who's more inclined towards quick story progression, you may want to reduce your exploration endeavors to just hunting down two specific things: <strong>Gold Sparkles</strong> and elite <strong>"Vicious"</strong> enemies.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gold Sparkles:</strong> As opposed to regular sparkles, these found on the world map hide special items and <strong>won't respawn</strong>. Hidden in them are rare items such as <strong>Seeds</strong> that can be used to boost your characters' stats permanently.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elite "Vicious" Enemies:</strong> These can be recognized by their <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">red glow</strong> and the fact that they don't move around. These more powerful variants can be challenging, but they drop <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hearts,</strong> which can be equipped to customize your characters with very useful passive abilities.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-thoroughly-explore-the-present-day">Thoroughly Explore the "Present Day"</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Present-Day-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Exploring the Present Day world carefully is really important in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is a common mistake for players to assume that the "Past" versions of islands are the only places where progress happens. However, you should make it a priority to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">explore everything in the Present Day</strong> as soon as an island has been restored. Many vital <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Fragments</strong> are tucked away in the modern versions of towns and dungeons.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can find <strong>useful gear</strong> and <strong>learn more about an island's history by speaking with NPCs</strong> when you revisit a location. In my first playthrough, I found that if I ever felt stuck or unable to progress at the Shrine of Mystery, the solution was almost always a missed fragment hidden in the most recently restored "Present" island.</p>



<h2 id="h-prioritize-defensive-gear-over-offense">Prioritize Defensive Gear Over Offense</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined-Shop-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Always priotize defensive gear to have an easier time throughout the game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When visiting a new shop in any of the game's villages and towns, you might be inclined to spend all your gold on the weapon with the highest attack stat. However, I highly recommend that you <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prioritize purchasing defensive gear first.</strong> In <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></strong>, especially at <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-difficulty-settings-for-a-balanced-first-playthrough-in-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/">high difficulty</a></strong>, survivability is far more valuable than raw power.</p>



<p>The reason for this is simple: every now and then, you will encounter powerful enemies and bosses that can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">act twice per turn.</strong> A character with a high-damage sword but weak armor can be wiped out in a single turn before your healer even has a chance to react. By focusing on shields, helmets, and armor first, you ensure your party can weather these difficulty spikes. This strategy is crucial for maintaining the game’s pacing and preventing lost progress.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While walking the halls of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-tabletop-games-at-pax-unplugged-2025" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged</a> this winter, I was immediately struck by the vibrant colors and interesting products on display from <a href="http://www.hugeminis.com/" rel="nofollow">Huge Miniatures</a>. After chatting a bit with the team, they sent along some products for me to check out and review. And I’m thrilled to say, Huge Minis is even better in practice than it looks on the shelf!</p><p>Huge Miniatures sent along a bevy of basing products and tools for me to check out, and I thought the best way to put them all through their paces was to scratch-build some tester scatter terrain out of cardboard. Follow my process and I’ll walk you through the products I used!</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Basing Fundamentals</h2><picture>

  </picture><p>My first order of business when setting everything up for this review was to create a base upon which to build a bit of scatter terrain. Using some scraps of corrugated cardboard I had nearby and some basic white glue, I created a rough hill with varying levels.&nbsp;</p><p>I always like to force a bit of verticality in my scatter terrain, and this off-centered hill felt like a good way to test how these products cover tight and wide spaces, as well as ridges.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>After a quick coat of brown acrylic paint over everything (which I would quickly learn was totally unnecessary!), I got to the business of testing out one of the products I was <em>most</em> curious about, the Huge Miniatures Texture Paste. They sent along both the Mud and Snow variations, so I started with the Mud as a basis.</p><p>Here's where I knew I was truly in for a treat! As soon as I opened up the canister and began to spread it on (using a Huge Miniatures Texture Paste Paint Knife, which they also provided), I was shocked by the texture (the name should have been a giveaway, I guess) - it spread evenly, but had a bit of stiffness and weight to it that allowed it to be molded.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-muddy-base-with-snow.jpeg?itok=YhZFWQJs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>Next up was the Snow Textured Paste, which I applied after the Mud had dried (set up in front of a mini-fan, this took less than an hour). And this was even <em>more</em> satisfying to spread on. Thick, but malleable, with a crisp white finish. The only way I can describe the texture was, to put it plainly, like working with cake icing.</p><p>This is the kind of basing material that'll make you want to use up the whole pot just playing around with it on your bases. Experimenting with this texture paste was so satisfying, and I found myself creating little moments and interplay between the mud and snow on the base.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the snow drifted up against the hillside, there, the mud bled through a shallow drift. It was environmental storytelling on the smallest scale, all thanks to Huge Miniatures.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Finally, it was time to try out the other basing materials included with this shipment, consisting of the Huge Miniatures 4-in-1 Tundra scatter foliage, frosty tufts, and snowy pure white weathering powder. Both the tufts and the 4-in-1 scatter were easy to use, and instantly helped flesh out the scene I created on my scatter.&nbsp;</p><p>The weathering powder took a moment to get used to, but once I'd gotten the hang of it, I was dusting those shrubs with the best of 'em! It's an interesting product, super-fine and light, and the idea is to apply it pretty liberally with a dry brush, then hit it was a lacquer or sealant and re-apply. At first, I couldn't see what it was accomplishing, but as it dried I was astounded by the wintry vibes it helped bring to life.</p><p>Now, in the above photo, you may notice some very disgruntled, frost-bitten Rebel Troopers (from <em>Star Wars: Legion</em>), I enlisted their help to see how all these basing products worked on actual model bases.</p><h2>Huge Miniatures Model Basing</h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-models-un-based.jpeg?itok=Q_AHWDN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>I started with a small handful of <em>Star Wars: Legion</em> models I'd already had painted. Pretty handy to have some snowy dudes to test out this snowy basing paste, huh?&nbsp;</p><p>I've always wanted to be the kind of hobby modeler and miniature gamer who fully bases his minis, but the reality is what you see above - it's actually a miracle that I even slapped some white acrylic paint around the bases of my Hoth Rebel Troopers.</p><p>So now, with the right tools and a reason to get back into it, I was ready to work on these bases of these minis.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-applying-basing-snow.jpeg?itok=dh0Ierv3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>This is where I felt the utility of the included paint knife. While you can use just about anything to spread this Texture Paste onto something as large as a piece of scatter terrain, I found the narrow point of the paint knife perfect for getting between the legs of these figures.</p><p>After liberally applying snow to the bases of these figures, I wanted to go all out and hit them with the weathering powder as well, to ensure they had the right, snow-bound look to them.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-snowy-figures.jpeg?itok=LTzUAiI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>And I mean... just look at these poor guys. Stuck on Hoth freezing half to death, I feel like a really captured the desperation of their situation. It was so fun to mold the snow around them, with the one model on his knee really being designed to look "dug in" to the snow - an idea I was able to push by piling on the weathering powder on his hat, shoulders, and gun barrel.&nbsp;</p><p>I also used the Mud Texture Paste on some random <em>Legion</em> commander models I had lying around, to see if I could recreate the feeling of soldiers trucking through the mud and muck.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/huge-miniatures-mud-texture-paste.jpeg?itok=T5iImTPP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">

  </picture><p>As you can see from the image above, the Mud Texture Paste is a little bit thinner and grainier than the Snow Texture Paste, by design.&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed me to create a much muckier and more fluid scene on these models' bases, allowing it to behave like and mimic Mud much better than if it had a similar constitution to the Snow paste.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Huge Miniatures Modeling Supplies - Final Thoughts</h2><p>What can I say? I'm completely hooked. I love the idea behind - and execution of - the Texture Paste. It's easy to use, dries to create realistic moments, and retains a strong color after drying. The 4-in-1 Tundra scatter was also a big hit, combining four different types of scatter foliage in one easy to use tub. And while the weathering powder took some getting used to, in the end I was really pleased with the results.&nbsp;</p><p>My only <em>real</em> complaint is that I used cheap corrugated cardboard as my scatter terrain base on this test and review! If I had known how much I was going to enjoy working with these products, and how strong the finished product would end up looking, I would have gone the full mile and custom cut some foam with the ol' hot wire cutter.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're looking to start creating scatter terrain for your games, or want to level up the bases of your miniatures, I cannot recommend Huge Miniatures highly enough.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Following a special Nintendo Direct broadcast last week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo is now celebrating the series on its music app this week with the release of the 3DS soundtrack.</p>
<p>This 3DS <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> game was locally released in 2014. The soundtrack contains a <em>whopping</em> <strong>210 tracks</strong>, with a runtime of 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "Oh Mii oh my! Songs from the Nintendo 3DS game Tomodachi Life are now available on the Nintendo Music app... Featuring tracks such as Afternoon on the Island, Mii Apartments, and more."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It was composed by Daisuke Matsuoka (who was recently credited for music in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>) and former Nintendo composer Asuka Itō, who contributed to multiple other Nintendo projects throughout the 3DS generation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Secret Lair sold the same drop at different prices, drawing anger from the community.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning Wizards of the Coast put a new Magic: The Gathering product up for sale with an unexpected twist. The <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/chaosvault" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Prints Charming” Secret Lair drop</u></a> contains four reprinted cards with pretty excellent new art – but rather than simply telling us how much it costs, it was given five different non-foil store listings and five more for the foil version, each with a different price ranging from $10 all the way up to $50. The product description on all of them is careful to point out the following: “The only difference between listings is the price. Higher-priced listings do not include anything extra.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, by my estimation as someone who has been playing Magic since the 90s and literally wrote <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art"><u>the announcement for the very first Secret Lair</u></a>, is pretty lame. Taken graciously, it’s a goofy marketing stunt meant to do something silly and get folk talking about it, but it nevertheless leaves those who arrived too late with a very sour taste in their mouth. A more pessimistic reading would be that WOTC is price testing what people are willing to pay for a Secret Lair drop in broad daylight, shedding even the thinnest veneer that may be hiding the capitalist hunger <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set"><u>a lawsuit recently alleged</u></a> is designed specifically to hide shortfalls in other parts of Hasbro’s business. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1qu0vyc/sld_chaos_vault_prints_charming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The reaction</u></a> amongst the Magic community has been muddled. Some were confused. Some very generously assumed the higher price points were to bait automated scalper bots into spending more while real people could snag a more affordable version – an argument that doesn’t exactly hold water when you consider that <em>they could just make them all cheaper </em>if that was the desire. And some were just angry, either because the cheapest versions sold out so fast, or because they similarly see this as bold-faced market research in cardboard form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I actually really love the idea of Wizards of the Coast’s Secret Lair line overall. Directly selling small drops of thematically linked cards with cool and unique art treatments is quite fun, and often comes at little-to-no cost for those who just want to ignore it. Being able to give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-secret-lair-superdrop-brings-the-last-of-us-god-of-war-and-more-to-magic-the-gathering-in-october"><u>Kratos or Aloy their own cards</u></a> without the production lift a larger product would require is a neat tool in WOTC’s toolbelt. The “Chaos Vault” moniker this latest one was released under intentionally pushes the envelope even further with weird, off-schedule ideas and one-offs that are explicitly meant to experiment. I dig that! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that does not mean Secret Lair is free from criticism. Most pressing here, folk (myself included) were already displeased by WOTC’s 2024 decision to move these drops from a “print to demand” model to one with limited and undisclosed quantities. The former system meant anyone who wanted a certain drop could get it within a specific timeframe, while the latter has historically meant you need to get in line <em>right </em>when a popular drop arrives in order to have a <em>chance </em>at purchasing it – something you can’t do if you, say, have work or school at the same time.</p><p>Regardless of intent, the result is a majority of players feeling like they were the ones left holding the bag.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, given there is already anxiety around the availability of Secret Lairs, one that got almost no pre-promotion offering an early bird discount (alongside the option to pay WOTC <em>more</em> money) is understandably frustrating. It’s the sort of thing that independent creators admittedly do with their products from time to time without drawing any ire, rewarding their most dedicated fans while also providing a way to support them even further for those who want to. But for a multibillion-dollar corporation to do it is not endearing in the same way – it comes across more like profit analysis wearing a sign around its neck that reads “it’s just a prank, bro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much to my dismay, both the lowest <em>and</em> highest priced versions of Prints Charming sold out the quickest, either lending some credence to the “ha ha stupid bots” theory or offering evidence that “speaking with your wallet” is and will always be a doomed suggestion. The standard Secret Lair pricing of $30 for non-foil and $40 for foil lasted much longer than the others, so it seems likely the “stock” for those versions was intentionally the largest of all the options. But even if that does make this one big stunt, or even a cute way to subsidize a few discounted drops through folk who are willing to spend a little more, the ultimate result is still that a majority of players feel like they are the ones left holding the proverbial bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know, maybe I am yelling at the clouds. The card-selling company is experimenting with how much money it can sell its cards for. This should not be a shock, nor am I surprised to see Prints Charming sell out within hours (the art is really excellent, even if its total reprint value of around $5 is not). But the quiet part is being said louder than usual here. The teacher has handed us a test, and I fear what the results will be. The theme of this drop is cards that speed up your green resource production, and if that’s not as on the nose as naming your giant evil space station the Death Star, I don’t know what is.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director and local MTG Cube obssessive.

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard’s 5v5 Raid Mode Has Been Added Permanently]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/</link>
            <guid>1423417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Highguard was released last week, one of the biggest points of contention concerned the game’s player structure. Each ‘raid’ in the game could accommodate just six players, three on each team. It made the game feel empty and promoted awkward pacing, and it was mere days before Wildlight, the game’s developer, introduced a 5v5 mode.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be a temporary thing to test the waters, but Wildlight has just confirmed that 5v5 is ‘here to stay’ after a successful trial period.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-5v5-do-anything-to-save-highguard">Will 5v5 Do Anything to Save Highguard?</h2>



<p>Highguard’s player count continues to drop, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/">the sentiments</a> surrounding the game are in a critical state. Any viewership has been almost eradicated, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">the year-long roadmap</a> has done little to instill a sense of confidence in those who would call themselves fans.</p>



<p>Last week, Highguard launched after several weeks of radio silence following the game’s grand reveal at The Game Awards. It was an unveiling marred by negativity, and the game’s full release did nothing to abate the disappointment of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>When it was discovered that this ambitious first-person shooter would accommodate just six players per match, prospective fans found themselves questioning the depth of their matches.</p>



<p>Then, along came Wildlight Entertainment, with an idea to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-adds-5v5-raid-playable-now/">trial a 5v5 mode</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Wildlight confirmed the trial was a success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay!</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under the post, the game’s fans put a positive spin on the change, suggesting it would cater to the more casual players and attract a wider audience. That hasn’t been reflected in the game’s player count, though.</p>







<p>Have you given Highguard a chance since the 5v5 mode was added? Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/looking-back-at-catacomb-3d-the-game-that-led-to-wolfenstein-3d/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          

<h2>No longer keen on more <em>Commander Keen</em></h2>
<p>While id’s decision to lean into fast, action-oriented first-person games might seem obvious in retrospect, the video reveals that it was far from an easy decision. <em>Catacomb 3D</em> earned the team just $5,000 (about $11,750 in December 2025 dollars) through a contract to deliver bi-monthly games for <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/355/gamers-edge/">Softdisk’s Gamer’s Edge magazine-on-a-disk</a>. Each episode of the <em>Commander Keen</em> series of run-and-gun 2D games, on the other hand, was still earning “10 times that amount” at the time, Romero said.</p>
<p>That made sticking with <em>Commander Keen</em> seem like the “obvious business decision,” Romero says in the video. The team even started work on a seventh <em>Commander Keen</em> game—with parallax scrolling and full VGA color support—right after <em>Catacomb 3D</em>‘s release. At the time, it felt like <em>Catacomb 3D</em> might be “just like a weird gimmick thing that we did for a little bit because we wanted to play with a different technology,” as John Carmack put it.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148926335?color=ff9933"></iframe></p><div>
    
    <p>
      A tech demo shows early work on <em>Commander Keen 7</em> that was abandoned in favor of <em>Wolfenstein 3D.</em>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>That feeling started to fade away, Carmack said, after his brother Adrian had an “almost falling out of his seat” moment while pivoting toward an in-game troll in <em>Catacomb 3D</em>. “It automatically sucked you in,” Adrian Carmack said of the feeling. “You’re trying to look behind walls, doors, whatever… you get a pop-out like that, and it was just one of the craziest things in a video game I had ever seen.”</p>
<p>That kind of reaction from one of their own eventually convinced the team to abandon two weeks of work on <em>Keen 7</em> to focus on what would become <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>. “It kind of felt that’s where the future was going,” Carmack said in the video. “[We wanted to] “take it to some place that it wouldn’t happen staying in the existing conservative [lane].”</p>
<p>“Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I’m just like, ‘Guys, we need to not make this game [<em>Keen</em>],'” Romero <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/in-first-person-john-romero-reflects-on-over-three-decades-as-the-doom-guy/">told Ars in 2024</a>. “‘This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with <em>Catacomb</em>.’ … And everyone was immediately was like, ‘Yeah, you know, you’re right.

      <p>David Michaud-Cromp, a team lead and level designer at Ubisoft Montreal, has been fired only days after being initially suspended for speaking out about the company's<a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>new return-to-office mandate</u></a>.</p><p>Last week Michaud-Cromp posted the following on Linkedin,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D6Tml2ZTCo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>while also adding a link to a video</u></a> which (rightly) says that bosses forcing workers to return to the office is rarely about team cohesion and productivity, and is mostly about control and a need to make use of expensive office space:</p><blockquote>So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they "believe in collaboration"... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office...</blockquote><p>Shortly afterwards, he posted (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-activity-7422041590854238208-HRdB?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGKgkgBAOVY8Y5QGfavSjX0Xx5EAfD5LNg"><u>again on Linkedin</u></a>) that the company had decided to suspend him for what he says was "an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty".</p><blockquote>Professional update: Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow. The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty. I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.</blockquote><p>Earlier today that suspension was<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_today-i-was-terminated-by-ubisoft-effective-share-7424133082590375938-GUZj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGKgkgBAOVY8Y5QGfavSjX0Xx5EAfD5LNg"> <u>changed to a termination</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Today, I was terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately.<p>This was not my decision. I won’t be discussing internal details or circumstances.</p><p>I’m taking time to regroup and will share next steps when appropriate.</p></blockquote><p>Even suspending Michaud-Cromp was an extreme step for simply sharing his thoughts about a ridiculous mandate. To terminate his employment over it and have it go public,<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-union-strike-layoffs-remote-work-prince-of-persia/"> <u>with everything else that's going on right now</u></a>, is a clear sign that however much trouble you <em>think </em>Ubisoft is in because of its leadership, things are probably even worse.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-union-strike-layoffs-remote-work-prince-of-persia/"><div><p>‘We Will Not Be Bullied Into Submission’: Ubisoft Unions Call For Massive International Strike</p><p>“Our goal is to make great games again, without having to look over our shoulder constantly, wondering what the next announcement brings, and who will fall”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p><strong>UPDATE 7:15pm ET</strong>: Ubisoft issued a statement to Kotaku which reads:</p><blockquote>Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal.

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has a lot of systems that its players need to be aware of, and while the gear you take with you each time you go <strong>Topside</strong> is important, you also need to be levelling up your Raider's skill tree appropriately, if you want to be able to make the best of your runs.</p>



<p>While completing the full <strong>Skill Tree</strong> is a slog, since you don't just have to unlock skills by spending individual points, you need to spend a certain amount of skill points in each of the three sections (<strong>Conditioning, Mobility,</strong> and <strong>Survival</strong>) to move into the second and third tiers of skills. </p>



<p>That means you don't want to needlessly spend your skill points on skills that won't have as much of an impact on your playing experience. This guide will show you which of the skills in the skill tree are the best in the game, and what you should be focusing on.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-skills-in-arc-raiders-guide">The Best Skills in ARC Raiders - Guide</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The ARC Raiders skill tree.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-conditioning-skills">Best Conditioning Skills</h3>



<p>The <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch of skills is all about keeping your Raider in top shape for the marathon that is going on runs Topside. The skills in this branch help toughen your Raider in bad situations, with some restoring stamina and health while you're low on health, and others that make you more proficient at common elements of the game, like breaching containers and how fast you can be with extra weight on your back. </p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Conditioning branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Used to the Weight</strong> - Wearing a shield doesn't slow you down as much</li>



<li><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> - Breaching doors and containers takes less time</li>



<li><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> - When you're critically hurt, your stamina regenerates faster</li>



<li><strong>Downed but Determined</strong> - When you're downed, it takes longer before you collapse</li>



<li><strong>A Little Bit Extra</strong> - Breaching an object generates resources</li>
</ul>



<p>The first on the list, <strong>Used to the Weight</strong>, is also the first Conditioning skill you'll unlock. Its description (read above) might not sound like a lot on the face of it, but when you consider that you'll be wearing a shield every time you're Topside, you immediately understand why it's essential. So essential that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> put it at the beginning of the branch, to ensure you don't miss it. </p>



<p>When you've unlocked the rest of the skills in the opening tier of the Conditioning branch, and you're looking for skills to dump points into so you can continue to the next tier, Used to the Weight should be one of the first skills you max out.</p>



<p><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong>, <strong>Downed but Determined</strong>, and <strong>A Little Bit Extra </strong>are all fairly self-explanatory in their importance. You're constantly breaching things open to get resources, and you're vulnerable while breaching something. You should work to make this as quick as possible. While Downed but Determined gives you a greater chance at survival if you do go down, with other players having more time to pick you back up. Lastly, A Little Bit Extra is just that - extra resources that can go a long way to making breaching anything and everything worth more.</p>



<p><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> is just as key as actually increasing your max stamina (which we'll get to in the <strong>Mobility </strong>section). You'll find yourself in a lot of tough situations in ARC Raiders. Having your stamina regenerate faster in those situations will help you get out of a lot of jams that would've otherwise killed you.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-mobility-skills">Best Mobility Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Conditioning branch helps keep your Raider in top shape, the <strong>Mobility </strong>branch keeps you nimble and mobile, with skills that directly impact your stamina, both how much you have and how it regenerates, how fast you are, and how far actions like jumping and vaulting can take you.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Mobility branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Youthful Lungs - </strong>Increases your max stamina</li>



<li><strong>Marathon Runner</strong> - Moving around costs less stamina</li>



<li><strong>Calming Stroll</strong> - While walking, your stamina regenerates as if you were standing still</li>



<li><strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> - When you're downed, you crawl faster</li>



<li><strong>Heroic Leap</strong> - You can Sprint Dodge Roll further</li>
</ul>



<p>Like some of the skills in the Conditioning branch, the importance of skills like <strong>Youthful Lungs, Marathon Runner, </strong>and <strong>Calming Stroll</strong> is all pretty self-explanatory. Everything you do impacts your stamina, so levelling up Youthful Stroll to give you more is a no-brainer; the same goes for Marathon Runner to make the stamina you do have go further. Calming Stroll helps you keep that stamina up and ready for when you need it, like being surprised by a Hornet or a Rocketeer you didn't notice was patrolling by, and you accidentally walked right into its sightline.</p>



<p>I can tell you from experience that <strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> (especially when paired with <strong>Downed But Determined</strong>) can be the difference between you making it back to Speranza alive or a failed run. Not successfully extracting stings, and it stings even more if the difference was just a few feet and your Raider's inability to stay alive for a few seconds longer. </p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Heroic Leap</strong> can be an essential skill for combat. As noted in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">Tips and Tricks Guide</a></strong>, plenty of the maps you'll visit in ARC Raiders have a serious lack of cover, and getting caught out in the open without a place to hide or duck behind can mean a resource-draining fight, or worse, the end of your run. Heroic Leap can take you that extra bit to help you stay ahead of ARCs and other players while in combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-survival-skills">Best Survival Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The third and final branch of the skill tree in ARC Raiders, the <strong>Survival</strong> branch, is all about skills that keep your instincts sharp while Topside. Some of that includes skills that impact how much noise you make and how you interact with looting resources, while some of the skills give you additional abilities to use while Topside.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the <strong>Survival </strong>branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>In-Round Crafting - </strong>Unlocks the ability to field-craft items while Topside.</li>



<li><strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> - Increases the maximum weight you can carry.</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Instincts</strong> - When searching a container, loot is revealed faster.</li>



<li><strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> - Your stamina regeneration is less affected by being over-encumbered.</li>



<li><strong>Minesweeper</strong> - Mines and explosives can be defused when in close proximity.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> is an obvious one, because it means you don't have to rely on bringing as many bandages and shield rechargers as you can carry. You'll be able to craft items like those on the fly while Topside, freeing up more space in your backpack for more tactical items. <strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> and <strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> are two skills that work in tandem with each other. One increases your carrying capacity, while the other ensures that even if you go beyond your limits, you won't be impacted as greatly as you could've been.</p>



<p><strong>Minesweeper</strong> is another that's important for obvious reasons, because being able to defuse explosives can help give you the upper hand when fighting enemy Raiders trying to get the jump on you. Lastly, <strong>Looter's Instinct</strong> works in tandem with <strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> from the <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch. Not only will you be faster when it comes to breaching, but Looter's Instinct helps to make the actual looting part as quick as possible, so you're not left vulnerable in the looting menu for longer than you need to be.</p>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>The five skills listed in each section are, in my experience, the best skills to put levels into as soon as you can, and the ones you should focus on unlocking the most. That said, there are a few that I did want to make sure I highlighted, so you don't needlessly ignore them.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sturdy Ankles </strong>(<strong>Mobility</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Luck</strong> (<strong>Survival</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Loaded Arms </strong>(<strong>Conditioning</strong>)</li>
</ul>

              <p>Don’t worry, podracing fans. While <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer’</em>s debut trailer didn’t feature any podracers, the iconic fast-moving space chariots will be a part of the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced last year at the Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an upcoming racing game set in that galaxy far, far away. <em>Galactic Racer</em> is being developed by some former <em>Burnout</em> devs at Fuse Games, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">a new studio created in 2023</a>. The game looks awesome and features Sebulba at the very end of its teaser trailer. However, there was not a single podracing vehicle to be seen in that first teaser, which had fans like me worried that we wouldn’t get to recreate the best part of 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace,</em> aka the podracing scene. Thankfully, there will indeed be podracers in <em>Galactic Racer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">In a recent interview with <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> &nbsp;Fuse Games CEO and co-founder Matt Webster told the outlet that yes, of course podracing will be a part of the studio’s <em>Star Wars</em> racing game.</p>  <p id="6d1737fa-b5a4-42f5-8eb9-7604d114ba62">“You can’t really make a <em>Star Wars</em> racing experience and not have podracing, can you?” said Webster. “The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy.”</p>

 <p>“However, when we set out to create <em>Galactic Racer,</em> we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. <em>Galactic Racer</em> offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes.”</p> <p>More good news: <em>Galactic Racer</em> will feature the option to drive around in first-person, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-star-wars-episode-i-racer-remaster-is-a-little-ugl-1844206400">which is my preferred way to play podracing games</a>.&nbsp;Now, I just need Webster or someone else at Fuse Games to confirm the Boonta Eve Classic race course featured in past podracing games, like<em> Star Wars Racer’s Revenge,</em> will be playable in <em>Galactic Racer</em>, and I’ll be a happy wookkiee when the game arrives on consoles and PC later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are on the edge of their seats as rumors and leaks seem to suggest a potential Chappell Roan crossover coming to Fortnite in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Femininomenon of the pop music world has been the talk of the Fortnite community since cosmetics related to some of her most iconic songs supposedly leaked late last month. Developer Epic Games hasn’t confirmed whether Chappell Roan or her famous pink pony mascot will actually show up in-game, but fans are still expecting an announcement as soon as this week.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">CHAPPEL ROAN POTENTIALLY NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ut2jTrm6Ok" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ut2jTrm6Ok</a></p>— Leaky (@itsmeleaky) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user @itsmeleaky seems to have been the first to kick off rumors that the Midwest Princess was next to join Epic’s roster of Festival stars, sharing images of some very Chappell Roan-looking music cosmetics and what appears to be a llama sidekick dressed up as a pink, cowboy hat-wearing pony. Players were then able to find these same items in <a href="https://x.com/realAlucar/status/2014308961957056613?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a special room in-game</a>, with some other familiar visuals, including flashy pink stars and some knight armor, adding to the pile of alleged evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All three items would certainly fit the occasion, especially the potential sidekick, which looks a lot like a reference to the star’s mega-hit song, Pink Pony Club. The knight armor, meanwhile, has been taken as a sign that at least one of what could be a few skins could pull from Chappell Roan’s medieval-themed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ENzV125lWc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Video Music Awards performance of Good Luck, Babe!</u></a>. She’s known for her many, many memorable looks, though, so music fans are still guessing which direction Epic could take her cosmetics should she have a substantial presence in Fortnite this month.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">👀| Fortnite appears to have begun teasing a possible collaboration with Chappell Roan <a href="https://t.co/zUMRqjXlxx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zUMRqjXlxx</a></p>— Chappell Roan Now (@ChappellRoanNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChappellRoanNow/status/2014734311988113832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the studio confirmed plans to launch <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2017289932310479080?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fortnite version 39.40</u></a> this week on January 30, leaving fans to look out for new content in the days ahead. Again, Epic hasn’t confirmed whether the star will show up at all, but for some, it’s not a question of if, but when and how.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chappell Roan’s status as a <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/chappell-roan/56864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy award-winning artist</a> with millions of listeners has many expecting her to headline an upcoming Festival update as its new icon. It would mean potentially multiple skins to accompany the inclusion of more of her music, though how the star’s career could be represented is unclear. It’s possible she could have a more muted presence, but with the previous icon, Lisa, set to rotate out in just a few days, fans believe it could be the perfect time for Chappell to make her proper Fortnite debut.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE VALENTINE'S DAY EVENT TEASER <a href="https://t.co/ew7rxBrrzg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ew7rxBrrzg</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/2018022087365951661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As Chappell Roan rumors for Fortnite heat up without official confirmation, players are still looking forward to other updates for February. The game’s official account recently put out <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2018021999876984903?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>what appears to be a tease</u></a>, saying, “In February, Fortnite wears pink.” It could be more evidence that Chappell Roan is on the way, but it’s also likely referencing its upcoming Valentine’s Day plans. Another <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2018399099192848442?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post from today</u></a> has music and movie fans looking forward to more KPop Demon Hunters content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite leapt into Chapter 7 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-draws-105-million-players-as-godzilla-king-kong-iron-man-and-kpop-demon-hunters-unite-for-avengers-endgame-style-finale">an Avengers: Endgame-style event</a> late last year. The months since have, of course, been filled with more crossover content, including a collaboration that brought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-meets-south-park-as-official-trailer-reveals-5-player-quints-playlist-and-a-free-mini-pass">South Park items into the fold</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-how-the-offices-michael-scott-and-dwight-schrute-look-in-fortnite">a few skins from The Office</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
