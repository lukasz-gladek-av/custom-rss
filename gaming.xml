The service for PlayStation 5 and PS4 players that lets them go online, chat with friends, and do all the other things fans expect to do on a modern console is integral for playing everything from <em>Fortnite</em> to <em>Roblox</em>, and the extended (and unexplained) outage across all of these features is making fans restless. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,195670,195150" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The PlayStation status page shows online gaming, account management, social features, the store, and more all still experiencing issues that began around 6:00 p.m. ET on February 6. So what has Sony said about this unusual outage? The only acknowledgement is currently a single post on X that reads, “We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.” </p><p>Players have wasted no time responding to the tweet (which currently has over 27,000 replies) and complaining about everything from the lack of further communication to all of the games that require an always-online connection to play or authenticate a license (like free downloadable games through a paid PS Plus subscription). Some are constantly checking their phones to see if service is back up while others are forced to contemplate actually going out in the world and engaging with society IRL. </p><figure id="" data-id="f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-recommend-id="image://f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-format="png" data-width="801" data-height="374" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone complaining about PSN.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>PSN being down means there’s no way to play some of the biggest games on PS5 right now, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>,<em> Marvel Rivals</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em>. The last of those just got a big update this week, while multiplayer functionality in <em>Madden NFL 25</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and<em> NBA2K25 </em>are also obviously all offline. </p><p>For some, the mysterious and protracted outage is already recalling nightmares of the infamous 2011 PSN fiasco that left the service offline for weeks following a hack that exposed over 70 million users’ data. A few fans are already proactively changing their PSN account logins in case that ends up being the case, though so far there’s no evidence of any security breach. </p><p>Other players are wondering if Sony will have a make-good for the extended downtime, especially on a Friday night heading into the weekend, a high traffic period for the network. Unlike on PC, PS5 and PS4 players have to pay for a monthly $10 subscription to PS Plus Essential to play online to begin with. More likely than not, PSN will just start working again sometime today or tomorrow and Sony will never speak of this outage again. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember when we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix was hiking prices again, but most of Europe had escaped</a>? Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/07/netflix-increase-uk-subscription-prices-despite-record-audience">The Guardian</a>, the streaming giant has now confirmed above-inflation price rises for UK subscribers, with its most popular non-ad-supported subscription increasing by £2 to £13 - that's an 18 percent hike - and its most expensive tier rising £1 to £19 a month.</p>

<p>Even the cheapest tier, which includes advertisements, has also increased by a pound to £6 per month. It now also costs an additional £1 to add an extra member to a package.</p>
<p>"We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix," the company said, saying the increased fees help the firm "continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, the news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter. And it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-network-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last night, the PlayStation Network went offline worldwide, preventing players not only from playing online games, but also digital games in some cases, and it definitely feels like something other than a DDoS attack may have happened.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation online services</a> have been down for over 14 hours worldwide with no communication from Sony other than a simple acknowledgment that the PlayStation Network is indeed down. Over the past few hours, some users managed to get back online and access their accounts and the PlayStation Store, but no online play has been possible for the vast majority of games, including the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-test-soon/">Monster Hunter Wilds open beta.</a></p>
<p>The almost complete lack of communication from Sony and the prolonged PlayStation Network outage immediately brings to mind April 2011's outage when the PlayStation online services stayed offline for 21 days due to an attack from hackers where 77 million accounts were compromised, and personal details were stolen. To compensate players for the outage, Sony launched a Welcome Back program, which offered a month-long PlayStation Plus free membership and a month extension for free users and two free games for each user, among a total of five PlayStation 3 games and four PlayStation Portable games. Hopefully, the new outage hasn't been caused by another hacking attack, and the service will return shortly with a proper explanation of what has happened.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-call-of-duty-down-on-playstation-black-ops-6-and-warzone-psn-servers-explained.1104009/</guid>

<p>Call of Duty has become a mammoth network of games culminating in the infamous CoD HQ hub. But if you’re having trouble playing Warzone, Black Ops 6, or any other Call of Duty game on PlayStation, the serves could be an issue. Let’s take a look at the latest happenings.</p>



<p>Activision has so many CoD games live at once it’s untrue. There are so many different eras of CoD you can enjoy and gameplay styles too. Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, and Battle Royale, mean there’s something for everyone. Every now and again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD’s servers</a> go down, and it can be due to issues with Activision’s servers.</p>



<p>There are other circumstances where everything breaks too. If you’re a PlayStation user trying to get into CoD but can’t, the PS servers are probably a big reason why.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-call-of-duty-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are Call of Duty Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, stop, I beg. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Call of Duty PlayStation servers are not working due to an issue with the PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been wrapped up in work, your busy life, or anything else, you might not have heard about PSN. PlayStation’s online infrastructure mysteriously went offline on February 8, causing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide outage of PlayStation online services</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows for sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>, and the only details so far come from the <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask PlayStation X page</a> on social media. The page officially addressed the problem with a quick message: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>.”</p>



<p>This does mean <strong>all forms of Call of Duty work elsewhere</strong>. Warzone, Black Ops 6, and any other CoD game currently work just fine on Xbox, PC, and other applicable platforms. If you have another console, or maybe COD Mobile on your phone, this might have to keep you ticking over until the maintenance issue is sorted.</p>



<p>We have pages dedicated to checking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN server status</a>, to make sure you know the latest information and updates. Other online multiplayer games are being affected, with PlayStation Network’s issues affecting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s online server status</a> too.</p>



<p>Keep checking back to Insider Gaming for the latest updates on the PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">servers</a>. Let’s hope this isn’t a repeat of the infamous 2011 PSN outage that lasted several weeks!</p>



<hr>



<p>This is especially bad timing with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty having a free weekend for Black Ops 6</a>. It’s also Double XP too. Are you hoping Activision extends the free trial and Double XP Weekend for all those affected. Discuss it in the comments.</p>



<p>Forget about the PSN troubles for now and check out some CoD content while you wait. We have guides on completing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-tomb-main-quest-easter-egg-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tomb Easter Egg</a> and building the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-build-staff-of-ice-wonder-weapon-the-tomb-zombies-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon</a>.</p>

<section><p>EA's predictions have been both eerily accurate and completely wrong in recent years. We're looking back at the past 10+ years to see how things have shaken out.</p></section>

                <p>Super Bowl LIX takes place this Sunday, February 9, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles duking it out for the title. EA Sports historically simulates the Big Game and releases the results of the match-up, and that continued in 2025 with EA's simulation predicting the Eagles will beat the Chiefs by a score of 23-21. The simulation also predicted that Eagles QB will be named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</p><p>Here are some further predictions from EA's Madden simulation of Super Bowl LIX, as written by EA:</p><ul><li><b>Final Score and MVP:</b> The Eagles edged the Chiefs 23-21 in a close back-and-forth game that came down to the final drive. Eagles QB Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</li><li><b>Early Game Dynamics:</b> The Eagles started strong with Saquon Barkley using his exceptional juking abilities to score the first touchdown. The Chiefs responded with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, but an interception by CJ Gardner-Johnson helped keep the game close.</li><li><b>Second Half Turnaround:</b> After the Chiefs led 14-10 at halftime, the Eagles took the lead in the third quarter on a touchdown pass from Hurts to A.J. Brown. A crucial defensive stand by the Eagles' line, particularly Jalen Carter, prevented the Chiefs from scoring on a fourth-down attempt.</li><li><b>Clutch Moments:</b> In the fourth quarter, Mahomes led a drive for a Chiefs touchdown, but the Eagles answered back with a field goal to regain the lead. The game came down to the wire with the Chiefs' final drive ending in a missed field goal, sealing the Eagles' victory.</li></ul><p>If you don't like this prediction or simply want to run your own, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/" data-ref-id="1100-6529306">download Madden NFL 25 on Game Pass today</a> and simulate the game for yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">EA's predictions in the past have been eerily accurate, like in 2015 when the simulation predicted the Patriots' comeback victory against the Seattle Seahawks--<em>and </em>the final score--along with the exact type of pass play that made it happen. It was spooky. But EA isn't always that accurate with its predictions. Sometimes, the simulation gets it very, very wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Big Game dominating the sporting world this week, we're looking back at the past 10 years of EA Sports Madden Super Bowl simulations and predictions. As you'll see, EA's track record for predicting the winner has been a mix.</p><p dir="ltr">EA got off to a hot start by accurately predicting the Super Bowl winners four straight years, from Super Bowl 38 to Super Bowl 41. Since then, however, the simulation never got it right more than two years in a row, but it also never got it wrong for more than two straight years.</p><p dir="ltr">What does it all mean? Looking at the past decade-plus, EA has accurately predicted the Super Bowl winner about 50% of the time, which is impressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Off the field, companies are spending <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" rel="nofollow ">as much as $8 million for 30-second advertisements on Fox</a>, which carries the game this year. This year, viewers can expect <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lot of ads about AI.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Here is a rundown of EA's Madden Super Bowl simulations over the past years, looking at what was predicted and then what actually happened in real life. Super Bowl 59 takes place Sunday, February 9, starting at 6:30 PM ET on Fox.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Madden Super Bowl Predictions Over The Years</strong></h2><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Super Bowl</th><th scope="col">EA Prediction</th><th scope="col">Actual Result</th><th scope="col">Right Or Wrong?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Super Bowl 59</p><p>Super Bowl 58</p><p>Super Bowl 57</p><p>Super Bowl 56</p><p>Super Bowl 55</p><p>Super Bowl 54</p></td><td><p><strong>PHI 23, KC 21</strong></p><p><strong>KC 30, SF 28</strong></p><p><strong>PHI 31, KC 17</strong></p><p><strong>LA 21, CIN 24</strong></p><p><strong>KC 37, TB 27</strong></p><p><strong>KC 35, SF 31</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>???</strong></p><p><strong>KC 25, SF 22</strong></p><p><strong>KC 38, PHI 35</strong></p><p><strong>LA 23, CIN 20</strong></p><p><strong>KC 9, TB 31</strong></p><p><strong>KC 31, SF 20</strong></p></td><td><p>Check back soon!</p><p>Right!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Right!</p></td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 53</td><td><strong>LA 30, NE 27 </strong></td><td><strong>NE 13, LA 3</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 52</td><td><strong>NE 24, PHI 20</strong></td><td><strong> PHI 41, NE 33</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 51</td><td><strong>NE 27, ATL 24</strong></td><td><strong>NE 34, ATL 28</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 50</td><td><strong>CAR 24, DEN 20 </strong></td><td><strong>DEN 24, CAR 10</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 49</td><td><strong>NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td><strong> NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td>Spooky Good!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 48</td><td><strong>DEN 31, SEA 28</strong></td><td><strong>SEA 43, DEN 8</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 47</td><td><strong>BAL 27, SF 24</strong></td><td><strong>BAL 34, SF 31</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 46</td><td><strong>NYG 27, NE 24 </strong></td><td><strong>NYG 21, NE 17</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr></tbody></table>

But that’s exactly what happened after my delightful time with <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1592170%2FSpirit_Swap_Lofi_Beats_to_Match3_To%2F" rel="sponsored">Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</a></em>.</p><p>It’s a mouthful of a name, but damned if the game doesn’t do exactly what it says on the tin. There are little colorful block-shaped spirits, and you swap ‘em around to match three (or more) while charming and calming lo-fi beats bang out of your speakers. It reminds me of the recent trend in anime where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime">the titles of shows are hyper-descriptive</a> to the point of hilarity, and just like those shows, there’s a lot more going on than a simple match-3 game with a chill soundtrack. And I love it.</p><p>In <em>Spirit Swap,</em> you play as Samar, a witch with a lovely technicolor wardrobe who protects the material plane from mischievous but benign spirits that occasionally cross over and gunk things up. Throughout the game, Samar encounters her gaggle of friends, talking them through their myriad problems by challenging them to spirit-swapping competitions — think <em>Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine</em> with a dash of informal talk therapy.</p><p>Swapping is generally straightforward but has some interesting gameplay twists. Spirits can only be swapped horizontally, which means you have to work harder to swap effectively. The game gets even more difficult with the addition of powerful, spirit-clearing spells that are unleashed by arranging spirits in specific patterns. If you still find that too simple, the game has harder difficulties and an endless mode once you’re done with the <em>criminally</em> short story mode.</p><p>While the gameplay scratches my match-3 itch, what I enjoy most about <em>Spirit Swap</em> is the characters and their interactions. They’re all sumptuously designed with a wealth of body shapes, colors, and gender expressions. More than that, they’re all voice-acted, and when Samar and the characters talk to each other, they actually sound like real humans having real conversations. When Samar comforts her friend Mo because of her recent breakup, the way they talk to each other sounds exactly like something I’d say and how I’d say it. </p><p>And for what looks like a relatively lighthearted match-3 game, the developers have stuffed <em>Spirit Swap</em> with social situations that are shockingly relatable. One character laments that because of their natural generosity, their friend group constantly leans on them for help while never asking if they need help. Another is perceived as quiet and standoffish but reveals themself to be surprisingly deep. (When Samar asks where that depth comes from, they essentially respond: “Nobody’s really asked me.” Which, damn, I felt that in my spirit.) Even the things that aren’t immediately relatable are still fun to experience. I <em>love</em> that every time you win a match, you’re congratulated with the Arabic endearment “Ya Habibi!”</p><p>All these details coalesced to make me feel good — not just about playing <em>Spirit Swap</em> but about games in general. It’s short, fun, sweet, artistic, personal, and funny. And it’s the kind of game that makes me want to make a game myself. </p><p><sub><em>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats To Match-3</em> To is out now on Steam and Xbox.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation Network being down is a catastrophic issue for the company and players. Millions of users (myself included) are subscribed to PSN and use PlayStation services regularly. But PSN is down, so let’s look into why this and how long the outage is expected to last.</p>



<p>I still vividly remember the great PlayStation Network outage of 2011. From April 20 to May 14, the community could not use PSN services. This meant no online play, messaging friends, or buying games using the PlayStation Store. It was an awful time, and I wanted to play Call of Duty and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield</a> with my friends.</p>



<p>Déjà vu has struck again in 2025. On February 8, PSN suddenly went down without notice, and it’s been off ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-playstation-network-down-right-now">Why is PlayStation Network Down Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not again. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The only thing any of us have been told so far is Sony is “currently experiencing issues” with its PlayStation Network service.</strong></p>



<p>A closer look at the PSN server status tells us “Some services are experiencing issues,” and this applies to all PSN media: Account Management, Gaming and Social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Social, and PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation X page</a> posted a single message <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a> “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>,” on February 8, and has neglected to comment since. PlayStation further cemented this mystery by having its main X page repost the Ask PlayStation message to its 42 million followers on the platform—but provide no statement itself.</p>



<p>Sony nor PlayStation have commented on the issue. Like PSN right now, we are all in the dark, and the community is understandably getting frustrated at the lack of updates. </p>



<p>With the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 getting a free weekend</a> and Double XP to boot, many gamers were probably looking forward to kicking back over the weekend and enjoying some gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-psn-coming-back-online">When is PSN Coming Back Online?</h2>



<p><strong>We still don’t know when PSN is coming back online, and there are zero updates or hints as to when.</strong></p>



<p>I wish I could give you more information, and we are doing our best to get the latest on the outage. Keep checking back as we intend to inform you as soon as we can. Furthermore, we have a separate page letting you know the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network being down</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates as we hope and pray PSN comes back online sooner rather than later.</p>

		<p>PlayStation Network is suffering a major outage, affecting the full gamut of online services that it provides.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 12PM 08/02</strong> – PSN has now been offline for at least 12 hours. Not exactly breaking news, but noteworthy.</em></p>


<p>it seems that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psn">PSN</a> dropped offline just before midnight in the UK, with <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">DownDetector noting a huge spike</a> of reported issues. That naturally tailed off as people went to bed, but our own PlayStations are reporting that PSN is offline as of 9:30AM GMT.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network status page is red across the board including account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and even PlayStation Direct.</p>


<p>I think the “some services” is understating things a little, Sony…</p>
<p>So, if you were hoping to get some online gaming in this Saturday morning, you might need to turn on a PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch or change plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XDFKfdi84Co">watch the 24/7 Tom &amp; Jerry anniversary stream instead</a>. I suppose you could always play something single-player instead.</p>
<p>We’ll try to keep an eye on things and update this page when PSN comes back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Insomniac Games founder and CEO Ted Price revealed that the studio had pitched Resistance 4, but Sony refused. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKbHKCUkpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, when asked about something the studio had come up with without getting it greenlit, Price picked this game:</p>
<p><em>Resistance 4. We did pitch that one, and it was a wonderful concept. It's just that, in terms of timing and market opportunity, it didn't work out, but it was the result of a lot of Insomniac team members being passionate about extending the story further. I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are. We spent a lot of time working on the backstory and kind of brainstorming on where we could take this in the future, and personally, I love this franchise.</em></p>
<p><em> I was fortunate enough to be Creative Director of the first few Resistance games and I will remember many, many moments, good and bad. When it comes to development, it taught us all a lot about how we could elevate ourselves under some pretty heavy and some pretty difficult situations. Fortunately, we love the fan response and we know that fans ask pretty regularly if we're going to do another Resistance. There's no answer to that, but I will say we pitched Resistance 4 and it was cool.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>When asked whether he thought Resistance 4 could still happen at some point in the future, Price replied:</p>
<p><em>Honestly, I hope so. I would love to see this story taken further, it's near and dear to my heart. There are so many cool things about it. [...] Resistance 3 was intended to end that chapter of the franchise with the way that we ended with Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various smaller story items. We wanted to do that so we would have more options in the future, whether we were to go ahead with more Resistance games or take another turn. When you work on a franchise for a long time, it's nice to have a chance to move on to something else. At the same time, it's also nice to be able to come back to it. Fortunately, because we're part of Sony and Sony owns the intellectual property of Resistance, we will always have that opportunity to revisit Resistance. If it works out again, as a fan, I'm going to be pretty excited.</em></p>
<p>Technically, the most recent franchise installment is the spin-off Resistance: Burning Skies, developed by Nihilistic Software and released in 2012 for the PlayStation Vita.</p>
<p>As for the likelihood of a new game by Insomniac, Sony appears committed to the partnership with Marvel. At the same time, the enormous licensing costs (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac Games leak</a>, it was reported that Sony may have paid Disney around $109 million for the Spider-Man IP) may eventually lead Sony back to its own franchises, which might re-open the door for a new entry in the first-person shooter franchise.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotzzy-is-still-haunted-by-that-interview-and-needs-to-%E2%80%98get-his-get-back%E2%80%99.1103892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Shotzzy is one of the most decorated esports players in the business. He’s one of just two competitors to secure a world title in <strong>two </strong>games, and he’s a multi-time champion and MVP. In the Call of Duty League, he’s known as one of the most consistently entertaining and capable players, taking up a key spot on OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>But he’s still not over the interview he gave in London in 2020. During the Madrid Major between January and February 2025, I sat down with Shotzzy and Huke behind the scenes, asking them where they’d like to go next in Europe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-redemption-story">Redemption Story</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas fell hard in the Madrid Major, being knocked out of the elimination bracket by a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side. For a while, OpTic Texas was the favourite to win, coming into the season hot off a win at COD Champs 2024. The team put up a solid fight, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the competition.</p>



<p>Most recently, OpTic Texas was in the news because Pred, who went on a hiatus from the squad in December 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">rejoined the team</a>, knocking Huke out of his temporary spot on the roster.</p>



<p>In 2020, Shotzzy journeyed to London with Dallas Empire, the team with which he’d win the Call of Duty League Championship later that year. He gave an iconic interview, but it seemed that the bright lights of the big stage put the young superstar on edge, and this was the result:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MOST AWKWARD ESPORTS INTERVIEW EVER!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ6fz8StG8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Shotzzy</a> in Madrid, I learned that the interview had never left his mind. When I asked if he and Huke would consider going to London for another Call of Duty tournament, Shotzzy said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London, yeah. I need to do — I had a really bad interview back then, in London. I’ve got to get my get back on that interview.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since that interview, Shotzzy has gone on to win two world championships in the Call of Duty space and is one of the most entertaining and charismatic players on the mic, so it’s safe to say that if he goes back to London, he’ll be able to ‘get his get back’.</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2025 is unravelling in Boston, and the group stage has already provided stacks of entertainment. Most recently, I covered comments made by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar</a> following a win over Team Liquid. Thanks to the work of M80, Team Liquid sits in the bottom of the bracket going forward.</p>



<p>The full bracket is now locked in and we have our first matches confirmed for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs. There are some gems hidden within the fixtures, including a clash between M80 and DarkZero and a face-off between FaZe Clan and SSG that’ll see one team move on to face G2 Esports, the tournament favourite.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-six-invitational-playoffs-are-finally-here">Six Invitational Playoffs Are Finally Here</h2>



<p>G2 Esports has stormed to the top of the standings ahead of the Six Invitational 2025, securing the top seed and earning a bye. The team performed masterfully in the group stage, refusing to drop a map and effortlessly walking all over M80, Liquid, JOEL, and Unwanted.</p>



<p>Alongside Team BDS, Virtus, and FURIA, G2 earned that all-important bye to automatically move one step further in the bracket at the Six Invitational.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Team Falcons, Liquid, Oxygen, and CAG have all found themselves in a critical spot in the elimination bracket.</p>



<p>Here are the opening matches for the Six Invitational 2025 playoffs bracket:</p>



<ul>
<li>w7m Esports vs. Unwanted</li>



<li>FaZe Clan vs. Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah vs. Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>M80 vs. DarkZero</li>
</ul>



<p>From the group stage, JOEL, Team Secret, PSG, and SCARZ were all sent home without making it out of their respective groups. It’s unfortunate, but both SCARZ and JOEL failed to win a single map in the tournament – but they don’t go home empty-handed. Even the bottom-placing teams win $35,000 apiece.</p>



<p>The grand final of the Six Invitational 2025 will take place in Boston on February 16, and it’ll feature an intense best-of-five series. The winning team will secure $1 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in esports. For the second-place team, there’s still a handsome prize worth $450,000 waiting for them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-playstation-network-down-%E2%80%93-how-to-check-psn-server-status.1103886/</guid>

<p>The PlayStation Network is the critical backbone of Sony’s entertainment infrastructure, supporting tens of millions of gamers worldwide. Today, our digital, ever-connected world depends on these services staying online – and if they go down, players everywhere will panic. In this guide, I’ll teach you how to check the PSN server status in a couple of seconds.</p>



<p>If you’re sitting there enjoying a game and suddenly discover you’ve been thrown offline, your first question will be: ‘Is PlayStation Network down?’ That’s just common sense – but it might not be immediately obvious how to check service status of PSN.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to do if PlayStation Network is down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-check-if-playstation-is-offline">Check if PlayStation is Offline</h2>



<p>The easiest way to know if the PlayStation Network is down is to check the central <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN service status page</a>. This is the most common way gamers will check if the PlayStation Network is offline or experiencing any issues.</p>



<p>On the network service status page, you’ll see a breakdown between various services, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Account management</li>



<li>Gaming and social</li>



<li>PlayStation Video</li>



<li>PlayStation Store</li>



<li>PlayStation Direct</li>
</ul>



<p>It might be that one area of the PlayStation Network is down while the rest is online as normal, so make sure the PSN server status page is your first port of call in a suspect outage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-check-if-psn-is-down-on-twitter">How to Check if PSN is Down on Twitter</h2>



<p>If you want to use Twitter (X) to determine if the PlayStation Network is offline, you’re best off following the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Ask PlayStation’ profile</a>. This page is managed directly by Sony PlayStation, but admittedly, it’s not the swiftest solution to get updates on PSN server status issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Otherwise, you can conduct general searches across social media to see if any gamers are experiencing PlayStation Network outages, or you can use a service <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/playstation-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Down Detector</a> to gauge the situation.</p>



<p>If the PlayStation Network is down worldwide, you’ll soon know about it. With the way modern gaming solutions work, when the PSN goes offline, you won’t be able to access <strong>anything </strong>worthwhile on your PlayStation console. It’s a huge pitfall for today’s ever-connected world, and it’s a crux we have to handle as gamers.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-playstation-network-down">When was PlayStation Network Down?</h2>



<p>On February 8, 2025, the PlayStation Network was plunged into darkness for several hours, with gamers worldwide taking to social media to vent their frustration. One of the kickers of this situation was that almost nothing was addressed by Sony, and just a comment was made on social media – and then nothing more for <strong>hours</strong>.</p>



<p>You can read more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about this PSN outage here</a>.</p>



<p>In October 2024, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-issue-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outage lasting several hours occurred</a>, with players losing access to every area of the PlayStation Network.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A live-action <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> movie is in the works. Hasbro Entertainment has partnered with Legendary Pictures to produce an official feature film of the acclaimed card game. In addition, they will help produce television shows based on the property.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Movie Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Hasbro and Legendary will be focusing on producing a live-action <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> film. Given that <em>Magic</em> is Hasbro's $1 billion brand with over thirty years of rich characters, settings, and stories to adapt, there is plenty of source material ripe for adaptation.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=82qh4RAN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-aetherdrift-insect.jpg?itok=BGBWz_VE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Once the feature film has led the charge, the two companies will help produce live-action television shows and other content as the universe of the property expands.</p>

<p>Legendary Pictures has a solid track record producing film and television for beloved brands. They're the studio behind the "Monsterverse" which adapted Toho's <em>Godzilla</em> monsters into blockbuster feature films alongside the Apple TV series, <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>. A second success is producing the two live-action <em>Dune</em> movies and the spin-off show <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> for the Max streaming service.</p>

<p>This approach is similar to another brand that Hasbro tried to expand: <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. After producing the critically well-received but commercially underwhelming <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>, they had plans for spin-off shows, one of which was being produced by Joe Manganiello.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, said, “We pride ourselves on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP, and no property better fits that description than Magic: The Gathering. Alongside the fantastic Hasbro team, we look forward to creating a multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hasbro and Legendary attempting to make a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> movie may be the next chapter in companies trying to adapt the brand. It is a dense, imaginative world full of interdimensional wizards, evil dragons, demonic crime syndicates, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">high-octane racing competitions</a>. Netflix announced an animated adaptation in 2019, but that project was quietly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canceled</a>.</p>

At about 11:45PM ET, I tried to play <em>Fortnite</em> on my PS5, but the game showed an error message and wouldn’t let me log in. I was able to start my digital copy of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, however.</p><p>“We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN,” Sony says in an 8:46PM ET post on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682">the @AskPlayStation X account</a>.</p><p>Sony’s status website says the issues started at 7PM ET, but <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/">Downdetector shows</a> user reports starting to come in about an hour earlier at around 6PM ET. At the peak, there were a bit less than 70,000 reports of problems on Downdetector. An r/PlayStation thread about the outage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1ik8p8k/is_psn_down_nothing_is_working/?sort=new">more than 9,000 comments</a>.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><div><p>PSN had an outage that lasted for around eight hours back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258989/ps5-ps4-playstation-network-down-outage-offline">in October</a>. It dealt with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107918/playstation-network-outage-march-2024">a partial outage in May, too</a>.</p></div><p><em><strong>Updates, February 7th</strong>: Added @AskPlayStation’s tweet, noted that the outage has been going on for hours, and added details about my own experiences with the outage.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, February 8th:</strong></em> <em>Noted that Sony has not released an update as of Saturday morning.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

PlayStation 5 and PS4 Players across social media, including X and Reddit, are reporting being unable to connect to Sony’s online services, including multiplayer matches and the PlayStation Store. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“At this time, the PlayStation Network (including PlayStation  Store) may not be available,” reads an announcement made by the Ask PlayStation Japan account on X at 7:12 p.m. ET on February 7. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers. We are currently investigating the issue and working to restore service, so please be patient.” It’s an especially unfortunate time for the network to go down with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1887911802853327236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>beta test weekend</a></span> currently underway. </p><p>There’s no information yet on what the cause of the outage is, how many people are affected, or when the service might come back online. While some service disruptions can last for just a few hours, others could go on for much longer, with spotty connection quality even as the network comes back online. The PlayStation status page <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://status.playstation.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently lists</a></span> all online services as being down. </p><p>And so far this certainly seems to be one of the bigger outages PSN has suffered of late. Players started reporting getting disconnected shortly after 6:00 p.m. ET and so far there’s no sign of anyone being able to get back on. The outage also appears to be worldwide, rather than being isolated to certain countries or continents. Sony did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>The nightmare scenario for Sony would be a malicious hack or some deeper problem that causes the outage to persist for days or even weeks. That’s been unheard of in the modern era, but that’s what happened back in the infamous 2011 PlayStation Network outage. So far at least, there’s no sign that something on that scale is happening again. Hopefully, the system comes back online shortly. I, for one, was supposed to be spending tonight with my buds in <em>Rocket League</em>.</p><p><strong>Update 2/8/2025 8:58 a.m. ET:</strong> Whelp, no Rocket League for me after all, or for anyone else. Over 12 hours later and PSN is still down with no new information on the cause of the outage or Sony’s timeline for bringing it back online. </p><p>That could either be a sign the company is expecting to have it back up at any moment or a more ominous signal that something more serious is going on.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
