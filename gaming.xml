			<p>Some may not remember it well now, but No Man's Sky had an utterly disastrous launch back in August 2016. After much hype, the released game proved quite disappointing to critics and fans alike. The Metascore average for the PC version is still <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/no-mans-sky/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sitting at just 61/100</a> (which is labeled as 'Mixed or Average' on Metacritic), and fans were also quite critical in their user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>One month after the game's debut, No Man's Sky was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mans-sky-investigation-uks-advertising-standards-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigated</a> by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority after many complaints from British customers. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-steam-page-not-mislead-consumers-asa-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared</a> of any wrongdoings on that count a few months later, but the mixed reception lingered.</p>
<p>Still, independent developer Hello Games embarked on a journey to deliver their true vision for the game. Year after year, they delivered dozens of major free updates, adding new features, content, and improvements in all areas, slowly winning back the respect and even admiration of gamers worldwide. In September 2021, five years after that fateful launch, No Man's Sky's overall user review score <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-has-finally-reached-mostly-positive-70-overall-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned</a> from 'Mixed' to 'Mostly Positive'.</p>
<p>Now, the game has reached another milestone, having finally moved from 'Mostly Positive' to 'Very Positive'. Game director Sean Murray, who also manages the official social media channels, <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1861859832187211963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X:</p>
<p><em>Holy shit you guys - it happened ü•≥</em></p>
<p><em>ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive üòç</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you Thank you Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è</em></p>
<p><em>You have no idea what this means to us üôè</em></p>
<p>It must feel good to have come this far after that debut. There is little doubt that it's one of the most epic comebacks in the history of gaming, arguably alongside Square Enix's Final Fantasy XIV and CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, is that Hello Games has earned back the love of its fans, who continue to play No Man's Sky in ever greater numbers after every new update. The last one <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the long-awaited cross-save progression feature and also brought back Mass Effect's Normandy to celebrate N7 Day. The studio's engineers also impressed once again with their PS5 Pro implementation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> a stable 8K resolution mode at 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky continues to be updated at an impressive pace, following the incredible recovery of the game, fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are also very eager</a> to discover more about the studio's next title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a>. This fantasy-themed game promises to be every bit as ambitious as the previous game, given the studio's goal to deliver a true planet-sized multiplayer sandbox roleplaying game.</p>

Instead, these are randomly* selected from the <em>hundreds</em> of emails we received (over 400, in fact, to give you an idea of how many games are out there), to highlight just what extraordinary variety and possibility that exists withing the broad world of independent gaming.</p><p>If you want to support these developers and their projects, there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff you can do. <strong>Adding them to your Wishlist</strong> makes a real difference, helping developers get both algorithmic <em>and</em> financial attention, let alone that it reminds you to buy it when it‚Äôs out. Telling others is huge too! Nag your favorite YouTuber to check it out. Force your grandparents to play the demo. Etch the game‚Äôs URL into your nearest mountainside.</p><p>OK, ready? And yes, this is a slideshow, get some cope. It‚Äôs how I can get away with doing these articles, so we all just accept it. Also, if you narrow your browser to portrait, or read on your phone, it removes the slides.</p><p>*I apply the smallest amount of curation to what‚Äôs featured, but it‚Äôs minimal.</p></div></div><div><p>There‚Äôs a very wonderful current trend for old-school FPS games made in the style of <em>Heretic </em>and <em>Duke Nukem</em>, with those chunky 2.5 pixels, and I love it. But it also leaves me craving the same but shinier. <em>HELLBREAK </em>looks like it‚Äôll offer me that‚Äîabsolutely madcap first-person shooting, combined with violent spells, all with a sort of <em>Diablo</em>-infused bunch of health bars and upgrades.</p><p>It‚Äôs set rather nebulously between the two world wars, with a soldier in hell fighting to save his soul, and weapons that are demonic versions of the arsenals of the era, and will include a score system based on combos.

It‚Äôs a city-builder combined with a railway manager, but presented in 2D pixel graphics that reminds me of a particular childhood era of gaming. Of course, it then carries over the more modern sentiments of the genre, with greater complexity of systems and resource management.

It also <em>looks</em> fantastic, too.

Not just the art so pretty I want to cuddle it, but an adventure game based around gathering magical stickers! There have been a few sticker-themed games of late, but most have felt too reliant on the gimmick, without the depth underneath.

You can also see gadgets others have made, take them apart, learn that way. Honestly, this should be in every classroom!

You learn about people, their stories and their secrets, and then make life-changing decisions about their destinies!</p><p>It all sounds wonderfully heretical, and there‚Äôs a demo out now to see just how much.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Funky Forest<br><strong>Release date:</strong> 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2695710/God_For_A_Day/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2695710/God_For_A_Day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>A ‚Äúboxing rogue-like‚Äù is an intriguing opener indeed, that only gets more eyebrow-raising when you learn it‚Äôs about battering your way out of Jotunheim so you can beat up your father, Thor!</p><p>The Steam page claims a tale of ‚Äúself-improvement philosophy‚Äù alongside a nine-part boss rush, with unlockables that will impact repeat play, all within a complex story set in Norse mythology.

The indigenous-owned Albuquerque developer, Subliminal, seems to be all about the adorable cuteness, and if they can match that with a solid sports game combined with a sweet between-game narrative, I think this could do well.</p><p>  <strong>Developer: </strong>Subliminal<br><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417530/Button_City_Soccer_Days/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417530/Button_City_Soccer_Days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span></p></div><div><p>Woah, this has some serious <em>The Lion King</em> on Sega Genesis vibes!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-mid-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends as a beginner, you'll see that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from. This includes ADC, Support, Jungler, Top and Mid. This guide will be walking you through some of the easiest Mid laners that you can play in League of Legends as a beginner. Being a Mid laner can be pretty daunting, as you are the most vulnerable lane out of the three. You have the possibility to be attacked from either side, whether it be laners or the jungler.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-top-laners-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Top laners for beginners&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mid Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p><span><strong>Veigar</strong> is, of course, on the list. As long as you stack his Q against minions or even against champions, you'll get stacks and more damage very quickly. He also has great crowd control, as he has the potential to stun enemies with his E. Depending on how well you farm, Veigar has the potential to snowball and be a real threat, allowing him to one-shot enemies with his Ultimate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lux</strong> is another great mage to play and is one of the easiest champions to learn how to play. She is quite versatile and can also be played as a support. Compared to other champions, Lux has a relatively low cooldown on her Ultimate, making her a nightmare for the enemy team. However, she can be a bit difficult as both her Q and her Ultimate are skill shots that have the potential to miss.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Malzahar</strong> is a ton of fun, and once you get the farming technique down pat using his DoT, you have a lot of potential to earn plenty of gold and get the advantage over your opponent. His voidlings are great distractions, and he has some great crowd control. Once his damage has ramped up, his Ultimate can be a real threat, as it stuns the enemy and saps their health.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Annie</strong> is a great mid laner to learn if you're just getting started in League of Legends. Her abilities are easy to use, and her damage is simple and efficient. As long as you make sure to stack your shield properly so that your ability stuns, you have the potential to wipe out many opponents, especially if you use your stun-infused ability to summon Tibbers on top of the enemy.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the easiest Mid laners you can learn to play, and they are a ton of fun to play, too. They have a lot of potential to make you the team carry as long as you learn their kits.</p>
<p>Good luck in the Summoner's Rift!</p>

            <p>
Thursday is upon us, meaning the Epic Games Store's latest freebie is now live - and to coincide with its arrival, Epic has revealed the next two games it'll be making free in seven days time.
</p>
<p>
First up for those wanting immediate amusement is developer Blowfish's Brotato, which is free to download right now until next Thursday, 5th December. It's a top-down arena shooter roguelite in which players, in the role of the titular potato, fend off alien hordes using up to six weapons at a time. Regrettably, I can't give you Eurogamer's verdict on it seeing as we haven't revewied it, but I <em>can</em> tell you it's currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam.
</p>
<p>
As for next week's Epic freebies - which take over from Brotato in seven days time - you'll be getting public transportation shenanigans in Stillalive Studios' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bus-simulator-21">Bus Simulator 21</a>, plus some family friendly sci-fi action-adventure in TT Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Brotato - Full Release Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfceZHR7Yq0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
The latter, if you're unfamiliar, is a Lego-ised retelling of all three Star Wars movie trilogies, combined with some exploration and collectible gathering across a large selection of open-world planets. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips called The Skywalker Saga "humourous if simple fun" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-a-complete-but-cluttered-collection">2022 review</a>, noting, however, that its open-world elements "held less pull."
</p>
<p>
Still, if it's freebies you want, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/brotato-ed4097">Brotato is your current Epic Games Store treat</a>, with Bus Simulator 21 and The Skywalker Saga taking its place starting next Thursday, 5th December.

In Ndemic Creations' mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Plague Inc, you nurture a disease and attempt to spread it across the world. Originally launched in 2012, the game saw a morbid upsurge in popularity during the early years of Covid, as millions of people sought to model the pandemic's advance or just play out their anxieties. Perhaps seeking to wash away any lingering bad karma, Ndemic have now unveiled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/after-inc-revival">After Inc: Revival</a>, a blend of city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> and miniature 4X set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. In Plague Inc, you brought the world to an end; now, you must grow it anew from the wreckage.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To be more specific, the game is set in "a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom". You'll found and develop an expanse of cosy blue rooftops, sleepy windmills and golden cornfields in the shadow of canted, overgrown city blocks. Mind the zombies, though. There are still a few of them lurking in the undergrowth, threatening to spoil the neo-rustic bonhomie. Find a rundown of key features below, air-lifted from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/">the Steam page</a>. The mention of "democracy or authoritarianism" makes this sound like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s rosy-cheeked stepchild.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Exploit the ruins of the past to scavenge / harvest resources.
</p>
<p>
- Expand your Settlement with housing, farms, lumberyards and much more.
</p>
<p>
- Shape your society and provide services to keep your people happy.
</p>
<p>
- Make difficult decisions - Are children an unaffordable luxury? Are dogs pets or a food source? Democracy or Authoritarianism?
</p>
<p>
- Exterminate zombie infestations and defend humanity.
</p>
<p>
- Explore a beautiful post-apocalyptic United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
- Build multiple settlements in a persistent campaign and level up abilities.
</p>
<p>
- Ultra-realistic modelling of Zombie behaviour based on real-life studies... :P
</p>
<p>
- Sophisticated narrative algorithms shaped by your decisions.
</p>
<p>
- 10 unique leaders with radically different abilities.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The game's out in early access in 2025, though you can install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndemiccreations.afterinc&amp;hl=en">a free-to-play mobile version</a> right now. The early access period will bring new settlement leaders, "more levels", "expanded campaigns", new character traits and crises, expanded localisation, and clues about the origins and workings of the Necroa virus responsible for the undead outbreak.
</p><p>
I like After Inc's art and choice of perspective, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>. I'm also interested in, and a little worried by, the game's portrayal of aftermath, which I imagine can't help but be a commentary on feelings about the coronavirus pandemic, for all its B-movie fantasy framing (the developers play up the connection in press materials, joking a little tactlessly that "After Inc: Revival is not based on any real-world situation" and there's "no need to start worrying about a real-life zombie apocalypse yet"). I'd like to know whether After Inc echoes or challenges the benign rhetoric of a "return to normal", which disregards the fact that Covid is still very much with us and a source of <a href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19">considerable death and disability</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal dispute between Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios against Valve first started in 2021 and has since been granted class-action status. This was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, where they stated that they saw a court document that shows the motion for class certification to be granted. United States District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead granted the motion. By doing this, it means that the antitrust lawsuit that was started by Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios now has the potential to become a significantly larger dispute.</p>
<p>Wolfire first <a href="https://wccftech.com/valves-founder-gabe-newell-ordered-to-ensure-in-court-presence-amid-steam-anti-trust-lawsuit/">filed the lawsuit in April 2021</a>, claiming that Valve's commission is "an extraordinarily high cut," constituting anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit also argues that Valve uses its dominance to "exploit publishers and consumers." However, this claim was actually dismissed in November 2021. Once that happened, the developer decided to reevaluate, update, and adapt their arguments in May 2022. As this happened, VR game developer Dark Catt Studios also filed its own antitrust lawsuit in June 2021. Some of the claims they made were dismissed, but they were allowed to continue the lawsuit based on some of their claims that were found to have validity.</p>
<p>Since the lawsuits were so similar, a court order was then issued in July 2022 to confirm that both cases would be consolidated into one.</p>
<p>The document says that the class action will apply to any developers, publishers, or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale. The class action refers to the 30% cut the firm takes from each purchase. The class action will be referring to the people on or after January 28, 2017.</p>
<p>Valve is not the only one who has been involved in a lawsuit for similar problems as of late. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Sony is also involved in a class action lawsuit</a>, as they removed the ability for retailers like Amazon, GameStop, or Best Buy to directly sell digital codes for PlayStation games. This led to a feeling that Sony was monopolizing the titles, and causing consumers to have to pay higher prices than they could have at an alternative retailer.</p>
<p>In the order, the judge has made the decision to deny Valve's request to exclude the testimony of an expert. This expert is Dr. Steven Schwartz, who has called both studios to argue their case for them. In this case, Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt will both be the class representatives for the action.</p>
<p>At the moment, there's no telling how long this class action will take, as the class action for Sony isn't due to appear in court for a couple of years.</p>

			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends, you'll find that there are <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five roles</a> to choose from in the game, all of which have different priorities. Top lane may be a little bit daunting, as you are the sole person in the lane and are responsible for everything that happens up there. However, there is a lot of fun to be had and a ton of potential to snowball and end up being the team carry. For those wanting to experiment with the top lane, here are some of the best top laners for beginners.</p>
<p>Check out our other League of Legends guides:</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/">Best Supports</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">Best ADCS</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-junglers-for-beginners-in-league-of-legends/">Best Junglers</a></p>
<h2>Best Top Laners for Beginners in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of top laners out there, with more being added all the time. However, some are significantly easier than others to play and can help you get to grips with the functionality of the lane.</p>
<p>One of the easiest top laners to try out is&nbsp;<strong>Nasus.</strong> He's been a mainstay in the game since its release and has one of the easiest kits to use. You just have to make sure that you are executing minions with your Q, and your damage will start to ramp up very fast. You also have the ability to slow your opponents significantly, making a chase much easier, especially if your jungler is ganking you. On top of that, if you are the one being chased, using your slow can also make it much easier for you to get away in sticky situations. Your Ultimate is excellent, as it makes you much bigger with a bigger health bar and makes it much harder to kill you. This is great if you're in a sticky situation or if you find yourself in a large team fight.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Darius</strong> is another typical top laner that you'll see in lane. He can be a massive pain to deal with, which makes it a great idea to learn him early on. Darius' abilities center around bleed damage, which can allow you to get some great early-game kills on opponents, especially if they are relatively squishy. It can be a bit tricky learning the rotation of his moveset, but once you've gotten the hang of it, Darius can make the opponent's life a misery.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Garen</strong> is another mainstay in League of Legends, and was one of the first champions to be released when the game came out. His moveset is very simple and is one of the easiest top laners to learn in League of Legends if you're a beginner. If you manage to get kills early on, you can snowball quickly and become a carry for the team, especially in team fights.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While&nbsp;<strong>Maokai</strong> isn't typically a top laner, he is currently very viable in the top lane thanks to the current meta. He's very versatile and works in both the mid lane and bot lane as a support. Roaming with Maokai is always a great decision and is a great damage sponge. As a result, he makes a great frontline if you're in a team fight, as he can protect the squishier champions, as well as root enemies using his Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are many other great top laners out there in League of Legends, all ranging in difficulty. Have fun experimenting, and good luck in the Summoner's Rift.</p>

The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-87-mechanical-keyboard-xbox/">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard - Xbox Edition</a> features a transparent green shell and matching keycaps similar to the console. But unlike previous iterations of the keyboard, this is the first from 8BitDo to incorporate RGB backlighting.</p><p>The Xbox Edition mechanical keyboard is now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder through Amazon</a> for $119.99 with shipping expected to start on January 16th, 2025. 8BitDo also announced the matching 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse alongside the keyboard, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=theverge02-20">also listed on Amazon</a>, but not available for preorder yet.</p><div><figcaption><em>The keyboard includes 8BitDo‚Äôs programmable Dual Super Buttons.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The keyboard features a tenkeyless layout with 87 keys that include a full function row, a Windows key, and the addition of an Xbox logo button in the upper right corner that serves as a shortcut to the Windows Game Bar. It pairs double-layered ABS keycaps featuring a matte UV coating for durability with Kailh Jellyfish X switches, and the keyboard is compatible with 8BitDo‚Äôs Ultimate Software V2 allowing its mapping to be customized and macros to be created.</p><p>As with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24113566/8bitdo-commodore-64-retro-mechanical-keyboard-specs-release-date-price-features">other mechanical keyboards</a>, 8BitDo includes a pair of large Super Buttons that can be programmed to trigger macros or other functions.</p><p>The RGB backlighting offers eight different modes including animated waves of rainbow colors or individual keys illuminating. 8BitDo says the keyboard‚Äôs built-in 2,000mAh battery can keep it running for up to 200 hours, but doesn‚Äôt specify if that‚Äôs with the backlighting turned on, or if that‚Äôs while connecting to a device over Bluetooth or using its included 2.4GHz dongle. With a dead battery, the keyboard can still connect to devices with a USB-C cable.</p><div><figcaption><em>8BitDo‚Äôs Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition matches the keyboard and features four customizable buttons, two on each side.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-r8-mouse-xbox/">8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse - Xbox Edition</a> has a similar transparent green shell as the keyboard, along with four programmable side buttons (two on each side) matching the colors of the action buttons on the original Xbox controllers. It uses a PAW 3395 optical sensor with six selectable sensitivity levels ranging from 50 DPI to 26,000 DPI. The Retro R8 Mouse‚Äôs polling rate can also be adjusted using 8BitDo‚Äôs Ultimate Software from 125Hz to 8,000Hz. The mouse‚Äôs primary buttons use Kailh Sword GM X Micro Switches which 8BitDo says have been ‚Äúengineered for up to 100 million clicks.‚Äù</p><p>The mouse‚Äôs 450mAh rechargeable battery can power the mouse for up to 100 hours when using a Bluetooth connection but with a low-latency 2.4GHz connection battery life ranges between 26 to 105 hours depending on the polling rate. To streamline charging the Retro R8 Mouse includes a matching charging dock that also includes a ‚Äúsignal-extending feature‚Äù that 8BitDo says ‚Äúensures robust and uninterrupted connectivity.‚Äù</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Palworld developers PocketPair have announced that Palworld will be getting one of its most extensive updates yet in December, with a new island around six times bigger than Sakurajima.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on Palworld‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656/photo/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>, where the new map was described as ‚Äúthe largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island in Palworld!‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe size of the new island is about six times more than Sakurajima,‚Äù they said.</p>



<p>You can see some of the Palworld DLC images below:</p>

<p>PocketPair is currently in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company over Palworl</a>d. Nintendo is seeking damages of 10 million yen (around $66,000 USD) for alleged patent infringement.</p>



<p>PocketPair says that they ‚Äúwill continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings‚Äù on the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the lawsuit hasn‚Äôt stopped the company‚Äôs ongoing success and drive to keep the game fresh. Earlier this week, the company also announced a Palworld X Terraria collaboration that would happen sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Palworld sold eight million units in the first six days since its January 19, 2024 release date, and, as of February 2024, announced that the game had sold 15 million copies on Steam and reached a further 10 million players on Xbox. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-lawsuit-against-steams-30-cut-of-game-sales-is-now-a-class-action-meaning-many-other-developers-could-benefit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
An on-going lawsuit against Valve about Steam's "anti-competitive" practices and especially, its infamous 30% per-game revenue cut, has taken an interesting twist. According to a report, it's now a class action suit that could benefit any developers or publishers who have sold a game over the Steam store on or after 28th January 2017.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's the broad background: in April 2021, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overgrowth">Overgrowth</a> developers Wolfire Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overgrowth-developer-felt-he-had-no-choice-in-filing-antitrust-suit-against-valve">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Valve in the USA</a>, arguing that Steam uses its dominance of PC game sales to distort the market and bury the competition, and in particular that the company's base 30% cut of revenue from each video game sold on Steam keeps overall game prices artificially high, with Valve allegedly pressuring developers not to sell their games for lower prices on stores with smaller commissioning fees.
</p>
<p>
"I believe that Valve is taking away gamers' freedom to choose how much extra they are willing to pay to use their platform," Wolfire founder David Rosen said at the time, as <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steams-us-antitrust-lawsuits-fail?s=r">preserved by the GameDiscoverCo newsletter</a>. "I believe they are taking away competing stores' freedom to compete by taking advantage of their lower commission rates. I believe they are taking away developers' freedom to use different pricing models."
</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Valve pushed back on all this. In July 2021, the company accused Wolfire of failing to supply evidence for their allegations, while describing the 30% basic revenue cut as an "industry standard" - a claim that, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/report-steams-30-cut-is-actually-the-industry-standard">not unfair</a>, flies in the face of both <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-state-industry-devs-irked-30-percent-storefront-revenue-cuts">growing developer discontent</a> and competitors such as Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store lowering their commission fees in recent years.</p><p>
Wolfire's lawsuit was eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfires-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-has-been-dismissed">dismissed</a> at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-responds-to-antitrust-lawsuit-defends-steams-30-cut/">Valve's request</a> in November 2021, with the judge in the case arguing that Wolfire had not demonstrated that they or anybody else had been harmed by Valve's management of Steam. The judge also observed that the fact that competing stores like EGS have taken a smaller cut and failed, nonetheless, to usurp Steam is evidence that developers and publishers largely consider Steam's offering worth the price.
</p>
<p>
The judge further rejected Wolfire's somewhat bizarre assertion that Valve has illegally tethered the Steam store (which sells the games) to the Steam platform (which encompasses social networking features, achievement tracking, game library management, and so forth). The judge found that the Steam store and platform are, on the contrary, a single product, with game sales funding the platform's various 'free' features.
</p>
<p>
Wolfire were given 30 days to amend their case, address the dismissal's criticisms and supply additional evidence. This they did, adding sufficient context to the original claims that, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-is-back-on/">in May 2022</a>, the court found that aspects of the antitrust lawsuit could move forward. In July 2022, a court order also confirmed that Wolfire's suit would be combined with another, similar antitrust lawsuit against Valve brought by multimedia production and VR company Dark Catt Studios.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today, and GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status">reports</a> that the combined suit has been recategorised as a class action suit. A class action suit is, broadly, one brought on behalf of a group of absent people, going beyond those actually in court. In the event that the plaintiffs win, everybody in that group of people stands to benefit. There is an absolute world of finickity legal detail within that hazy definition, mind you, even if you confine your attention to the laws of a particular country.
</p><p>
According to GamesIndustry's James Batchelor, "the class action will apply to any developers, publishers or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale - referring to the 30% cut the Steam firm takes from each purchase - on or after January 28, 2017." GI also report that the court have denied Valve's request to exclude the testimony of a particular expert called by Dark Catt and Wolfire - the economist Dr Steven Schwartz. 
</p>
<p>
All of these legal wrangles form part of the larger, existential industry wrangle about Valve and Steam's centrality to PC gaming. My extremely Baby's First Monopoly take is that whatever your feelings about specific aspects of Steam's service, or Valve in general, no individual company should exert this much power over the fortunes and overall culture of an artform. As such, I welcome efforts such as Wolfire's to challenge Valve and Steam, even if I may not agree with the detail of the suit in question. 
</p>
<p>What happens if Wolfire and Dark Catt win? According to my "PhD in Googling" grasp of class action law, it potentially means that Valve might have to compensate a large number of parties, adding up to far more than if they'd had to compensate Wolfire and Dark Catt alone. In turn, this might lead to a larger policy change at Valve, which would have dramatic ramifications for PC game publishing as a whole.</p>
<p>If you'd like to dive into the nitty-gritty of the legal proceedings, the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-tim-sweeneys-epic-rant-to">GameDiscoverCo</a> newsletter is worth signing up to. One question it raises is where, exactly, Wolfire and Dark Catt are getting the money for their legal expenses, given the vast expense of discovering and amassing evidence for a case like this.

After Palworld‚Äôs huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld‚Äôs Pals and Pok√©mon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pok√©mon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pok√©mon in a virtual field, that it's being sued over.

Known for its fast-paced action and revolutionary 3D graphics (even though they weren't true 3D!), DOOM popularized multiplayer deathmatches. Did you see the game's chainsaw weapon was inspired by a real chainsaw the developers kept in their office?</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM II (1994)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The sequel expanded on its predecessor with new enemies (like the deadly Arch-Vile), weapons (double-barreled shotgun, anyone?), and larger levels. It also introduced modding tools that made DOOM II one of the most modified games of all time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 64 (1997)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Nintendo 64 exclusive for years, this cult hit features darker graphics and a haunting soundtrack compared to earlier entries. Fun fact: DOOM 64 introduced the "Unmaker," a demonic laser weapon not seen in any other game until DOOM Eternal.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM 3 (2004)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This reboot brought horror to the forefront with its dark corridors, jump scares, and a flashlight you couldn't use simultaneously with weapons (a controversial design choice). DOOM 3 also marked id Software's first foray into true 3D rendering.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM (2016)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This fan-favorite reboot resurrected the franchise with fast, brutal gameplay that ditched cover mechanics for relentless forward momentum. The "Glory Kill" mechanic was a game-changer, encouraging players to get up close and personal with enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition (2020)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The most recent entry cranked up the chaos with more vertical movement, new weapons, and a deeper storyline. The Deluxe Edition includes DLC expansions like <em>The Ancient Gods,</em> adding hours of gameplay and even tougher challenges.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p id="doom-anthology"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Doom Anthology">Best Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">Nintendo Switch digital game deals</a> to consider, especially if you're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-oled-black-friday-bundle-2024-live">picking up a console</a> too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-with-aeriths-briana-white/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, Square Enix has demonstrated an exceptional talent for casting, discovering outstanding actors who brought new characters to life with remarkable depth. One such actor is Ben Starr, whose performance made Final Fantasy XVI protagonist Clive even more memorable. The same can be said about the Final Fantasy VII Remake cast, who redefined beloved characters with fresh and compelling performances.</p>
<p>Among the talented cast of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Briana White‚Äôs portrayal of Aerith Gainsborough stands out as truly exceptional. Bringing the young flower seller from Midgar‚Äôs Sector 5 to life was a challenge even for a seasoned performer, let alone a relative newcomer, but Briana delivered two unforgettable performances that earned her a Golden Joystick Award for Best Supporting Performer and a nomination for Best Performance at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As a lifelong fan of Final Fantasy VII since its original release in 1997, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak with Briana about her journey as Aerith, the Remake project, her streaming career, and much more. You can find our chat below. Enjoy!</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I felt the pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your nomination for Best Supporting Actor for this year‚Äôs Golden Joystick Awards and Best Performance for The Game Awards! A victory would have been completely deserved because you masterfully brought Aerith to life and made her an even more compelling character. How does it feel to receive such glowing recognition for your first video game voice-acting job?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much. It's completely surreal. When I got the audition, I thought I would never book it. When I booked the audition, I thought I would get recast during recording. Now, after three games, seeing my work get recognized in this way is incredibly special. I'm so grateful for this journey and it has totally changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith is among the most popular Final Fantasy characters ever released. Why do you think she resonates with so many people and continues to be loved even decades after the original game‚Äôs release?</strong></p>
<p>As a character, Aerith left a lasting impact on people with the original Final Fantasy VII because of her surprise death early on in the game. I think her story reminded gamers around the world that life is short and fragile, so don't take it for granted. For many people, Aerith‚Äôs death helps process what it means to lose someone you love, which is a universal experience. I think that's why her impact is still felt to this day. With Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, we get the opportunity to fall in love with Aerith all over again, entrenched in the memories of the past and always colored by an ephemeral fear that we might lose her again. It's a very complex and beautiful experience.</p>
<p><strong>After being cast to play Aerith in Final Fantasy VII Remake, did you feel the pressure of the expectations fans may have had for playing such a beloved character?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I felt that pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith's role in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is more central in the story than in Final Fantasy VII Remake, and as her importance in the story increased, she became more complex. How did you prepare for the challenge of bringing an even more nuanced version of the character to life? Has your experience in Remake taught you anything that helped you take on this challenge?</strong></p>
<p>Through Final Fantasy VII Remake, I was really overwhelmed with the technical challenges of voice acting for the first time. Keeping my dialogue clean of the tiniest of mouth noises, choosing my character‚Äôs diction, learning how to make effort sounds, discovering how to project without blowing out my voice, keeping my breath grounded, and, all the while, maintaining motivation and emotion for the character. For Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, I had the unique challenge of taking on a younger, softer version of Aerith while using the same exact script from the original game. For Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I had all that experience under my belt, so I could really just act. I let Aerith's character shine through like she deserves, focusing entirely on telling her story. I feel incredibly grateful to have had the experience of the prior two games to get to know her and, really, even myself.</p>
<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the culmination of Aerith's role in the story. Did knowing how her story concludes influence your performance in any way?</strong></p>
<p>When recording for the ending of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it was a challenge to let go of any<br>
preconceived notions based on the original game. Knowing that Aerith dies in the original Final Fantasy VII wouldn't help me in the booth. So I really had to let that all go and focus on each line, each moment of telling Aerith‚Äôs story. Of course, when recording the end of any game, the emotion is heavy, and the impact of these scenes is felt by us as we are crafting them. It was a very powerful moment in the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>With Aerith being such a well-loved character, how do you balance staying true to expectations while bringing your own interpretation to the role?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of that is decided collaboratively as a team. As a localization, we rely on what we receive from the Japanese team a lot. The writers translate the script, I listen to the legendary Maaya Sakamoto for every sound Aerith makes, and then I give my best versions of what I think that should sound like in English. From there, the director chooses which takes he thinks will fit best or guides additional takes if necessary. So, in order to honor both Maaya‚Äôs version and Aerith‚Äôs legacy through time and my own heart, it really takes a village.</p>
<p><strong>You are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrFt_rBvaE&amp;list=PLeNs2fU0UP2UY41Oj0w5kzMqA4Gwt4JnY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on Twitch and YouTube. Is this the first time </strong><strong>you are experiencing the full game? And if so, what‚Äôs been leaving a strong impression on you?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my stream on Twitch is my first time playing through the game! There are some things I<br>
remember recording and some things I don't, and on top of that, I never get access to any part of the script that doesn't have Aerith involved. I also don't see the finished product all put together. So to play the game for the first time is really special and to share that with my community is even more special.</p>
<p><strong>Are you dreading the moment you will see *that* sequence at the end of the game? I know I did, despite having known about it since I played through the original for the first time back in 1997.</strong></p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team have done such a great job of making the Remake series still feel fresh and new and unknown, so mostly, I'm just happy to be along for the ride! It is surreal for me because I helped make the game, but while playing it, I still get to be just a fan for some parts and enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Fans have been discussing since the release of the original who Cloud is really in love with. Knowing these characters as intimately as very few others, what do you think? Who‚Äôs Cloud‚Äôs real sweetheart?</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the strengths of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the connection between all of the characters. When it comes to world-saving stakes, all of the main party put their lives on the line for each other. There is no truer love than that. As for romantic love, it completely depends on the player and the scenes they unveil as they play with their preferred companions. That's the fun of it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Voicing Aerith has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, more than in the original, it definitely feels like Aerith still has a thing for Zack, even after his death. What do you think are her real feelings towards Cloud?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think anyone could play Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion and come away with any doubt that Aerith and Zack care for each other. From Aerith‚Äôs perspective, Zack disappeared and hasn't contacted anyone in years. Aerith makes it very clear in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth that she cares for Cloud as well for who he is.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a story moment from the original you are really looking forward to seeing in Part 3?</strong></p>
<p>As I haven't played through the original, I look forward to discovering the silly moments that make Final Fantasy so fun. In addition, after all these years, I'm really looking forward to the final confrontation with Sephiroth.</p>
<p><strong>If you weren‚Äôt playing Aerith, is there any character in Final Fantasy VII you would have liked to bring to life?</strong></p>
<p>I would have been thrilled to play any character in the game, even an NPC shouting at Cloud to come buy an ether. But if I had to pick someone from the main cast, Tifa is such an amazing character that I would have loved to take that on as an actor- not that I could ever compare to Britt‚Äôs incredible work. On the other hand, I bet voicing Scarlet is an absolute blast.</p>
<p><strong>If you could use one word to describe your experience being Aerith in Final Fantasy VII, which would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p>Dream. Because voicing her has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.</p>
<p><strong>You have been running your Strange Rebel Gaming Twitch and YouTube channel way before you played Aerith for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Did the popularity of your playing the role impact your streaming career?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, it did. I was streaming to 90 people before my casting as Aerith was announced. That's still a very solid number as a variety streamer and I am incredibly proud of what I built with Strange Rebel Gaming before Final Fantasy joined my resume. When Final Fantasy VII Remake was released during the COVID-19 global lockdown, I was very suddenly streaming to 8000 people. That was a bit overwhelming for both me and my moderators.</p>
<p>Now it has settled, and I am streaming to about 1000 people, which I feel very lucky to say. My community of Strange Rebels are some of the kindest, smartest, funniest, and most generous people out there. They restore my faith in humanity a bit. Over the past few years, the Strange Rebel Community has raised over $53,000 for charities like World Central Kitchen, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and Gamers Outreach. I am most proud of that.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs next for you after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Any future projects you can talk about?</strong></p>
<p>Nope! I am auditioning and waiting and auditioning and waiting. Such is the industry. But in the<br>
meantime, I continue to stream and make content that I hope brightens people's days, even just a little bit. That makes everything worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed a new major update, which introduces "the largest and harshest" island in the survival game's history, together with new tower bosses and new pals. As for everything else‚Ä¶ that's a secret, but you can expect a "large amount of new content", and we've got a few images to speculate over.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Going off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236002110311119?l=english">Steam announcement</a>, Palworld's next major update lands sometime in December. With it comes a new island "six times the size of Sakurajima", which was the area added in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huge-palworld-update-adds-arena-multiplayer-a-new-island-oil-rigs-and-a-new-pal-from-outer-space">last major update</a>. It'll include new species, but not just any new species - "vicious" species. This suggests that the pals will be nasty and horrible, as opposed to pals.</p>
<p>Let's look at the three images (the only images we have) of the new update.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first looks like some form of gold coin heist, with various pals marching out of a cave with overflowing coin sacks in tow. A new way to earn large amounts of money? At what cost, though? (probably death).</li>
<li>The second image features a golden stag beetle fella in an autumnal forest. He's absolutely not going down easily.</li>
<li>The third image features a crystalline pool that lies within a vast cavern. A precious resource?</li>
</ul>
<p>Elsewhere, a collaboration with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> is in the works for 2025. No other details on that, but I'd imagine some assorted monsters from the Terrariaverse will shift over into Palworld.</p>
<p>Pocketpair have got bigger things to worry about even than islands right now: they're being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement. Let me hit you with a quick TLDR (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">here's the more detailed rundown</a>). When Palworld first launched, some Pok√©mon players thought that Palworld had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">broken Pok√©mon's copyright</a>. After some time, in December Nintendo were then like, "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">have some legal proceedings</a>", although it wasn't clear which bits of Palworld they were going after.</p><p>Earlier this month, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">revealed three patents Nintendo and the Pok√©mon Company are taking them to court about</a>. The Pok√©mon lads are also seeking an injunction against the game, potentially blocking sales. It's not clear what the outcome will be, but Pocketpair aren't backing down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
