            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/into-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PikPok has announced the release date for zombie shelter survival game&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>, the latest entry in the developer's&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>series and the first one to land on PC.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Future Games Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 9th. PikPok says it's intending the game to remain in Early Access for "at least a year", but that timeline "may shift".</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>games were released on mobile devices (and Switch), but&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>represents the franchise's first foray into the land of PC. It's also getting a native Mac port.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date-stained-glass.jpg?itok=ry8Ywd4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date-stained-glass.jpg?itok=Bj9QN4si 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam in April.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect from an&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>game (assuming you've played one before, of course),&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>offers side-scrolling action blended with base management and survival horror-style exploration.</p>

<p>From your shelter (which can, of course, be upgraded), you'll sally forth into the city of Walton to scavenge for supplies and help your camp to survive. Of course, along the way, you'll have to deal with the undead.</p>

<p>PikPok describes&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>' world as "dynamic and challenging"; you'll be faced with decisions like whether to recruit allies or leave people to fend for themselves, how to manage your camp's "physical and psychological needs", and more.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the developer says that entire parts of the town "may become overrun and completely uninhabitable" as you play, necessitating a shelter move or perhaps even abandonment. It's all down to you.</p>




<p>You may be a little worried about&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>if you can remember the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players" rel="nofollow">last zombie survival game</a> that tried to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media" rel="nofollow">make a name for itself</a> on Steam, but this one looks like it's much more reasonably scoped, so hopefully, we won't get a repeat of that debacle.</p>

<p><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 9th.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</a>, is coming up to three years now, but at the Future Games Show this evening, all these years on, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> announced that the strategy action game will be getting its first bit of DLC, War Sails. If you can't gather from the name, featured image above, and trailer below, the DLC is all about boats; sailing 'em, fighting with 'em, trading with 'em, you name it, these boats can do it (within reason).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
War Sails quite notably is introducing a Viking-inspired faction, where you can do your usual thing of deciding to trade, recruit, or fight them (once you've made your way to the Northern Kingdom anyway). Based on details from a press release, sailing won't be as easy as 1, 2, 3 as you'll have wind and water physics to deal with.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA0YoFBX60M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
But one thing that does sound neat, and you can catch a glimpse of in the trailer above, is that you'll be able to ram into and board enemy ships, as well as destroy their oars and tear their sails. Sounds like a slightly more in-depth take on what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> has going on, and I'm quite fond of that game.
</p>
<p>
The DLC will have 18 ships to choose from, all of which handle differently and can be upgraded, and you'll be able to unlock more banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armour, that sort of thing. You've not long to wait either, as it's set to be released this coming June 17th.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, more free updates are planned too that'll bring in some new mechanics like a stealth and disguise system, a Parley feature, and general combat improvements. Best keep your eyes peeled for that one.

            <p>Frosthaven - the sequel to Cephalofair's knock-a-horse-out massive board game - is getting a digital version from Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games. You can <a href="http://playfrosthaven.com/">sign up here</a> to its closed beta kicking off March 27th, and it's coming to Steam early access later this year.</p>
<p>Like predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>, Frosthaven is a tactical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you'll resolve story events and encounters between dungeon delving, retiring old characters and unlocking new classes as you progress. New to Frosthaven is a fleshed-out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> that has you build up and  protect an outpost, while dealing with harsh seasons and invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I really <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">enjoyed Gloomhaven digital</a>, mostly for not getting in the tabletop game's way to much, but also for not requiring glue to put third party token trays together. Core to the game is tactical card combat where everything from movement to spellcasting is dictated by your hand. You pick two cards a turn from a deck you customise as you progress, and select actions from the top of one card and the bottom of the other. Each card also has an initiative value, so you're constantly assessing threats to see if you can pull off slower moves, or even whether you're better off sacrificing advanced plays altogether and opting for the generic attack or move option each card offers.</p>
<p>You can get old cards back by resting, but this means burning others. It's all crunchier than a Crunchy bar dredged in grit then left out to dry under an alien sun that emanates ultra-crunchy crunch rays, but  also full of character and a bit of roleplaying.</p>
<p>Designer Isaac Childres has consulted on the digital version throughout development, and Snapshot say they've spent a lot of time getting the feel of the world right in motion. In a preview session I attended recently, Director Hristo Petkov gave me the example of the Snowdancer. She's a bestial, graceful hero character whose dance-like fighting style the team had originally animated as similar to Capoeira - before Childres told them he'd imagined it closer to ballet. There's an entire environment named the Metallic Ruins in the digital version that only exists as prose in the board game, and they've worked closely with Childres to bring it to life here.</p>
<p>They're keen to highlight a more robust tutorial this time, too - also designed by Childres - alongside some more granular difficulty selections, including ones that prevent you getting exhausted and failing. The early access version has 35 quests across the first two acts of the game, with the full game planned to have over 130. There's also 2-4 player co-op multiplayer. I'm excited! I never ended up buying Frosthaven, since I'd also need to start sleeping on the box to justify the space investment, so this suits me just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, the fantasy strategy RPG famed for its endlessly enjoyable medieval combat, is taking to the high seas in its next expansion, War Sails. The upcoming naval expansion was announced during the Future Games Show Spring Showcase.</p>







<p>War Sails will introduce naval combat to Mount and Blade for the first time in the franchise’s history. Taking much inspiration from the Vikings, players will command 18 types of ship, engage enemy ships in naval combat, and build an empire on the seas. The trailer showed large-scale naval battles and the ability to command a massive fleet and board enemy ships. Just like with their armies on land, players will need to upgrade and manage their fleet, and keep supplies stocked to prevent poor performance or even a mutiny.</p>



<p>In the Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord base game, players grow their parties from a small band of soldiers into a powerful army capable of taking any stronghold by force. Over time, players outfit their army with siege engines and cavalry. The roleplaying elements come into play when players manage relationships with various NPC like local lords, merchants, and brigands. There are eight major factions, each consisting of its own set of clans, beliefs, goals, and outlier groups. In the trailer for War Sails, the various color schemes of the different factions can be seen on the soldiers and the ship dressing. A ninth faction, the Nords of the Northern Kingdom, will debut in War Sails. New features like a robust stealth system and random events will be added to the base game as well.</p>

<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered is all set to arrive on PC next month, April 3, and to celebrate the occasion, they are introducing new No Return Content as a free PS5 update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s new No Return content will be available on PC at launch and on PS5 on the same date as the free downloadable 2.0.0 patch. This update will introduce four new maps, two new characters, new trophies and additional bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-tlou-2-no-return">What’s New in TLOU 2 No Return?</h2>



<p>The Last of Us 2’s No Return mode’s first new map is Overlook, which provides a view of the city of Seattle. Next is School, where players might remember facing W.L.F with Ellie and Dina. The third map, Streets, is set in Hillcrest’s overgrown neighbourhood. Last is Nest, the infected-infested building players had to clear as Abby in The Last of Us Part 2.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Last of Us 2 will add Bill and Marlene as the two new characters for No Return in the latest PS5 update. Bill features the ‘Smuggler’ playstyle, has access to the custom pump shotgun, receives double rewards from drops, and can fend for himself against melee attacks but cannot dodge. Marlene, on the other hand, has the ‘Risk Taker’ play style, which provides her with a Custom Assault Rifle, ‘All or Nothing Gambits’, and has the ability to reroute her No Return Path once per run.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-2-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-jacket">The Last of Us 2 Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Jacket</h2>



<p>Moreover, Naughty Dog is offering some cosmetic content for The Last of Us 2 along with the No Return content; it will be available on PC and PS5 for free. It is a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from their upcoming game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Players will have to unlock the skin via in-game bonus points.</p>

            <p>
You know, with there being so many games set in ancient Rome, most of them being strategy games, I'm not sure I've ever seen a pixel art game with that setting. I bring this up because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romestead">Romestead</a>, a pixel art game with that exact setting, just got announced at the Future Games Show. From the offset it looks a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a>, and according to the publisher behind it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/three-friends">Three Friends</a> themselves, the latter is in fact a source of inspiration, alongside SNES classic The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Described as a survival town-builder, Romestead lets you rebuild civilisation from ruin as a Roman leader (which as a concept considering publisher Three Friends is made up of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> devs). That involves things like putting your people to work by farming crops, smithing weapons, rounding up resources, all things you appear to be able to do yourself too, so I imagine you can't be tyrant right from the get go, as was typical of many Romans back in the day.
</p>
<p>
There's a worship system where you can pray to a bunch of Roman gods to unlock various buildings, upgrades, technologies, all of which I find amusing very conceptually. "You have prayed enough to me so I give you the gift of a slightly bigger house" is how I imagine to play out, which tickles me in a "aren't video games so quaint?" kind of way.
</p>
<p>
That Zelda element comes in through dungeons that you can explore and bosses you can face off against, and a big ole world to explore too. And to boot you don't have to do it alone as there's multiplayer co-op too.
</p>
<p>
Romestead doesn't currently have a release date, but it is planned for an early access release. If this all takes your fancy, then you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805320">here</a>.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released a new trailer for the remastered version of <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> title <em><a title="Games > Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny (2025) [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-2025">Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</a></em>, featuring director Motohide Eshiro who introduces the new “Hell” mode. <span id="more-951509"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>The trailer showcased the Director’s Cut featuring Motohide Eshiro and the all-new “Hell” mode. In this mode players will experience a challenging new difficulty for only the bravest of samurai where a single hit means instant death. <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> returns with an enhanced remaster set to captivate a new generation.</p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>, the highly acclaimed, best-selling hack and slash game from Capcom’s classic samurai <a title="Genres > Action [2,588 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> series, originally released in 2002 and combines rich narrative and intense demon-slaying combat that made it a standout in the <em>Onimusha</em> franchise. Blending historical figures and supernatural folklore in feudal Japan, the story follows a new hero, master swordsman Jubei Yagyu, who sets out on a quest to defeat Nobunaga Oda and his army of demons. As players engage in intense swordplay, they must also make choices that impact the narrative in unexpected ways.</p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> also features a range of new game mechanics, including an affinity system with Jubei’s allies and branching narrative paths along with new quality-of-life features such as the ability to swap weapons without pausing the action and the power to choose when Jubei transforms into an Onimusha. Modern improvements like auto-saves, skippable cutscenes, multiple aspect ratios, and more are included, along with an in-game gallery expansion with 100 newly added pieces of artwork and the original soundtrack.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom revealed a special bonus for players who pre-order <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> or pick up the “<em>Onimusha 1</em>+<em>2</em> Pack” bundle early, which will include the “<em>Onimusha 2</em>: Orchestra Album Selection Pack,” featuring orchestral music tracks and helpful in-game items. Players with save data from the 2019 remaster of <em>Onimusha: Warlords</em> can also unlock a special outfit for Jubei inspired by Samanosuke, the protagonist from the original game.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Today, during the Future Games Show, the Polish studio not only announced a new development studio in Broken Mirror Games, but also the label's first project: I Hate This Place, an adaptation of the popular comic series via a partnership with Skybound Entertainment.</p><p dir="ltr">I Hate This Place is an isometric survival-horror game that puts players into the role of Elena, who finds herself dealing with a supernatural evil she mistakenly unleashed into the world. Elena will fight her way through hordes of monsters with both melee weapons and firearms, while also crafting important supplies in her bid to reach each safehouse before nightfall.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462412"></a><figcaption>I Hate This Place</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462412-ihtp_screen3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462413,1300-4462414,1300-4462415,1300-4462416,1300-4462418" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462413-ihtp_screen1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462414-ihtp_screen2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462415-ihtp_screen3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462416-ihtp_screen4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4462418-ihtp_screen5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A brief teaser trailer shows off the adaptation's visual style, which will use a retro comic-book theme similar to its source material. We also see a few of the giant monsters Elena will face off against, as well as a brief tease of the Horned Man at the center of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">The original comic version of I Hate This Place, written by Kyle Starks and drawn by Artyom Topilin, launched in May 2022 through Image Comics and Skybound Entertainment. The series saw 10 issues released between May 2022 and July 2023, with two hardcover collections releasing later in 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">I Hate This Place is set to launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/33-immortals/" data-ref-id="5000-590941">33 Immortals</a> couldn't be further from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spiritfarer/" data-ref-id="5000-497656">Spiritfarer</a> if it tried. Developer Thunder Lotus made an impression with its cozy and, at times, tear-jerking management and platforming mash-up, but is trading its glistening seas and carefree exploration for a far more dangerous expedition. 33 Immortals is all about action, thrusting you and over 30 others other players into chaotic PvE skirmishes and even greater challenges as you attempt to ascend through the different floors of the underworld and wage a rebellion against the forces that keep you there.</p><p dir="ltr">33 Immortals attempts to distill the rush of an MMO raid into smaller, run-based encounters that you can participate in with up to 32 other players. Each run starts on a relatively large map that revolves around PvE encounters. You're encouraged to quickly link up with other players in order to survive, while also empowering yourself by killing enemies and collecting resources for upgrades. Dotted around the map are 12 Torture Chambers, which are your initial objectives to tackle. These combat arenas only allow six players in at a time but through two intense waves of enemies at you in a confined space. Clearing these rooms offer rewards, but also work towards the greater goal of unlocking an ascension challenge. The stakes shift here, with a more involved combat encounter waiting for a larger group of 11 players. Those remaining outside can use the time to continue getting stronger before attempting the challenge too, with the final, climatic boss fight waiting once everyone still alive manages to succeed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462537" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462537"></a><figcaption>As its name implies, 33 Immortals sees you teaming up with 32 other players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462537-01_screenshot_33-players-5574056faa05b22c011e.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The structure that each run follows offers an easy to understand process that you need to follow to ultimately succeed, stripping out a lot of the guesswork usually associated with raid-like activities in games like Destiny and World of Warcraft. This not only allows runs to be significantly shorter, but also means you can easily hop in and out of sessions without having to commit potentially a few hours at a time to make progress. This streamlining is exactly what 33 Immortals is aiming to achieve, but right now it comes with the caveat of reducing your focus solely down to its combat, which doesn't yet exude a level of depth that suggests it'll be enough to carry run after run.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to feel weak when setting out on your first few runs in 33 Immortals, but this feels by design. Cooperative play isn't optional: It's required. Attempting to traverse the PvE areas alone won't get you far, as even small groups of enemies present significant challenges to your survivability. Your combat abilities also rely on synergizing without other player classes, each of which is determined by the weapon you select before each run. At this stage, there are four weapons available: a greatsword that can deal and block a lot of damage, a bow that lets you fire and recall projectiles through enemies, a magical staff that prioritizes slowing enemies down, and a pair of daggers that let you quickly cut down foes. Each weapon also has an associated ultimate ability that requires two other players to trigger when cast, further establishing teamwork as the only means of utilizing your full skill set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462538" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462538"></a><figcaption>You can unlock perks to cultivate your experience.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4462538-03_screenshot_dante-b1ede2ecc33e03a03c29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">No singular weapon makes you feel like you can tackle every enemy you encounter, but the ways in which they determine loose class-based play is lost in the chaos of the frantic and fast action. It's difficult to parse what other players are doing at times, especially in Torture Chambers where space is extremely limited. This diminishes the ability to effectively work off the strengths and weapon choices of other characters, which might only become more of an issue as additional aspects of each weapon are unlocked. That's coupled with movement that can feel sluggish at times, and a dash with a range that is too limited and a cooldown that is far too long to make use of when you really need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a roguelite element to each run, too, in that various buffs and gear will disappear once you return to your camp after death. Altars around the world let you trade in resources you collect from killing enemies for boosts to health, damage, and more. You can also collect gear of various rarities, each with their own abilities, that you similarly lose at the end of a run. Permanent upgrades are acquired through completing feats: challenges that are collected into groups assigned to different weapon types, specific world interactions, and basic actions that you'll likely complete without giving much thought. The list of feats is extensive, with each category featuring a subset of six other categories, each with three or more challenges to complete. 33 Immortals makes it clear that progress is intrinsically tied to completing feats, which unlock permanent buffs to your health, damage, and weapon abilities. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, however, and it's slightly disheartening that a weapon's feats only unlock after you've completed a run with it, negating any progress you might have initially made.</p><p dir="ltr">It is, however, difficult to make a firm judgment on an experience that is clearly designed to keep you engaged for a long time, as you slowly improve your abilities and weapons in order to more easily make your way through each level and its associated bosses. The content on offer is also limited, with the first two of three stages unlocked, and most tutorials missing still. There's a strong sense that Thunder Lotus has established this base experience to really test its approach to condensing a raid experience, and will hopefully be making bold and sweeping changes to the elements that don't work. The limited time ahead of the game's early-access launch just gave me a sense of the ideas 33 Immortals is attempting, and it left me wanting to explore it more. But it also made clear that there's already work to be done to make each run a more engaging experience.</p>

The talk, like the game, included a massive amount of content that explored unique stories in the game and how they were implemented.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Narrative director Cat Manning opened the talk by breaking down how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s overall narrative system—consisting of design elements like storylets and narrative tags—let writers tell stories across ages in any given playthrough. The system was so powerful and large that, once launched, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> included 1,262 narrative events.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A powerful narrative system">A powerful narrative system</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We wanted enough events so that players would get a pretty good number," Manning said.

Every writer on the Firaxis team could add narrative tags to certain events, those tags could then trigger events that would lead to other events and so on.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/consume-me-wins-grand-prize-nuovo-award-at-the-2025-igf-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Consume Me' Wins Grand Prize, Nuovo Award at the 2025 IGF Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That system allowed Firaxis storytellers to engage players with fascinating stories that came from throughout history, including fascinating chapters like the The Great Republic of Rough and Ready, a California city that voted to secede from the United States during the gold rush and a fictitious character in Roman history that Firaxis called "the first wife guy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first wife guy is a narrative event in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that involved a man erecting a commemorative stone in honor of his wife, who managed the man's affairs while he was in exile. The monument was "a flashpoint in the discussion on civic virtue," as read in the description found in-game. The player could then choose to "repossess the exile's property, move the stone to an honored place, or even teach the inscription found on the stone as rhetoric" to their people.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization's VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s narrative system allowed this story to live on much longer, if the player chose to engage with it.

It's the same monument that was established many years before by the wife guy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Archaeology is storytelling, not a cold [retelling] but a perspective on a sequence of carefully chosen events," said narrative designer Nell Raban. "When we use the narrative system to procreate a story with the player in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civ 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we're building that history layer by layer. With archaeology, we're able to excavate that history."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Civilization has always had a humorous relationship with history—as players often shared screenshots of Mahatma Gandhi threatening the player's Civilization with war. Narrative designers and historians working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wanted more from the game's relationship with world history this time around. It obviously would never be anything close to accurate the majority of the time, but could provide an alternative history that still had bits of truth in it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-bleak-humor-and-desperate-power-of-consume-me" target="_self" data-discover="true">The bleak humor and desperate power of Consume Me</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When we say fiction, the word comes from a meaning of being fabricated,"&nbsp; said senior historian Andrew Johnson.

Players are often given the power to explore histories that could never exist, like Abraham Lincoln fighting against the Roman Empire in previous games. It also pushes players to fill in the gaps of their civilization's history through the small narrative events they experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as Civilization games span the entirety of human history, it's important to stop and remember the stories of individual towns, relationships, and people. That's why Firaxis worked so hard to create narrative moments like that of the first wife guy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Clearly, this guy's love for his wife endures, and so does history if we care enough to preserve it," Raban said. "When you span all of human history, you need those moments when you stop to remember."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-has-a-new-plan-for-games.1140564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s gaming strategy to date has been scattershot. Since Netflix gaming debuted in 2021, the streamer has launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23340894/netflix-lucky-luna-platform-game-iphone-android">indie darlings</a>, streaming tie-ins, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249136/netflix-civilization-6-street-fighter-4-game-releases">blockbuster ports</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree">studio acquisitions</a>, attempts at original AAA games, and experiments with cloud streaming. A few years on, it’s not entirely clear what the strategy is — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">or if it’s really working</a>.</p><p>So when Alain Tascan, former executive VP of game development at <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204447/netflix-president-of-games-alain-tascan">joined as Netflix’s new president of games last year</a>, his assessment was to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.” As he explains it: “we need to find our voice.”</p><p>According to Tascan, that means focusing on games that fit into one of four categories. These include narrative games, like its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">interactive fiction titles tied to Netflix reality shows</a>, along with multiplayer party games and games aimed at kids. Rounding out the quartet is what Netflix calls “mainstream” releases, which basically means anything with the potential for a huge audience. That could be a licensed tie-in like last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a> or original games like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632526/spirit-crossing-netflix-games-mmo-spry-fox">just-announced <em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>, an ambitious MMO that looks like a cross between a Studio Ghibli film and a larger-scale <em>Animal Crossing</em>.</p><p>Tascan likens this strategy to the early days of Netflix’s original programming. It started with a few series, like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and now Netflix produces a huge range of shows, movies, and live programming. For games, the idea is to focus on titles that fit into the four (admittedly broad) categories and then, eventually, expand from there. “We’re starting with those,” he says. “Down the road we might add more if it makes sense, but I think starting first from these four is already a lot.”</p><p>This also means scaling back in some areas. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix shut down an internal studio focused on AAA titles</a>, helmed by industry veterans from franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>God of War</em>, before it even released a game. And while Netflix has become a notable publisher of indie games on mobile, it sounds like that, too, will become a smaller part of the overall plan. “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games,” Tascan says. Everything has to fit with the overall strategy. “If a game that has been created independently fits one of those categories nicely, we’ll probably go after it,” he says.</p><p>The eventual goal is to become, well, the Netflix of games — a sort of one-stop shop where it’s fast and easy to find something new to play. Part of achieving that is having a broad range of games meant to appeal to Netflix’s existing audience and potential new subscribers. But just as important, according to Tascan, is reducing the friction to playing games. Unlike a Netflix show, which simply involves pressing play, getting into a game involves more steps, like finding it in an app store and downloading it.</p><p>While that’s the case right now, Tascan wants the service’s gaming efforts to eventually be playable “instantaneously” and to make them platform agnostic, meaning you can play them on any device. Right now, due to a combination of technical hurdles and app store restrictions, the process isn’t exactly smooth. “Being accessible instantaneously on any screen is the ultimate goal,” he says. “I’m coming from a world where I’ve seen success by taking walls down. <em>Fortnite</em> was one of the first games to really do cross-play, and I feel that was one of the big reasons for its success.”</p><p>He believes this future will happen within the next five years, citing various converging elements like streaming technology improving and becoming cheaper; an audience that now expects experiences to carry over between devices thanks to games like <em>Fortnite</em>; and Netflix’s growing global audience. “We’re getting really close,” Tascan says. “It’s all evolving in the same direction.”</p><p>As a first step, the streamer will be launching its first TV-focused games by the end of this year. Currently, all Netflix games are mobile titles. But these new, unannounced games will be playable via a smart TV and controlled via a smartphone, removing the need for game controllers — another point of friction.</p><p>Perhaps even more ambitious, Tascan believes that one or several of these unknown games have the potential to have a similar impact to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott concert in <em>Fortnite</em></a>, a moment that took players by surprise and permeated pop culture in a way that games rarely do. “I hope that some of the offerings we have at the end of the year will create this type of moment,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">combining “the best of Xbox and Windows together”</a> for handhelds, and now the company is starting to drop the first hints at what that UI might look like. In a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">blog post</a> about Xbox “opening a billion doors,” Microsoft briefly revealed a new Xbox UI that looks a lot more console-like across multiple devices and even appears to list Steam games.</p><p>After briefly posting an image of a new Xbox UI across multiple devices, Microsoft quickly removed it once <em>The Verge</em> inquired about it. The image has a new Xbox UI that can be seen on a TV, where you can clearly see the Steam label listed. The same UI, with the Steam mention, is also shown on the tablet and handheld versions.</p><p>While the image appears to be a mockup, with owned games listed twice as well as action-adventure titles, I don’t think the Steam label here is necessarily a mistake. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me that the company is currently working on an Xbox app update that will show every game you have installed on your PC. That includes games from Steam and the Epic Games Store, and I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly.</p><p>I’m told Microsoft is still in the early stages of this Xbox app update, so the company might never ship the feature to list all your Steam games, but this mocked up image shows how they might show up eventually. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112591/microsofts-gaming-chief-hints-that-xbox-could-get-pc-stores-one-day">previously hinted</a> that PC stores like Epic Games Store and Itch.io could one day arrive on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Microsoft has also been working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and listing Steam games in this app would certainly help. GOG has a similar system in place, so you can see games you own on PC across multiple launchers.</p><p>I asked Microsoft to comment on the appearance of this Xbox app UI, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After years of development, Assassin's Creed Shadows is out now. You don't need a console or a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-specs-highlighted-features-and-more/1100-6528990/" data-ref-id="1100-6528990"> high-end PC</a> to play the game, however, as it's available to stream in multiple places.</p><p>In addition to being available to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-stream-assassins-creed-shadows-if-they-buy-the-game/1100-6530144/" data-ref-id="1100-6530144">stream for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>, people can sign up for Nvidia's GeForce Now service to stream it there after buying the game outright. This is similar to the Game Pass option, as its part of the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"stream your own game"</a> perk for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>If you're new to GeForce Now, the appeal of this service--and cloud gaming platforms in general--is that you can play new games without needing powerful, expensive local hardware. That's because games stream from, in this case, Nvidia's server racks.</p><p>The best experience costs $20/month and includes access to playback from a Nvidia computer with a GeForce RTX 4080 GPU. For $10/month, subscribers get a lesser GeForce RTX rig, and for the ad-supported free version, games stream from what's described as a "basic" rig.</p><p>There are also queues based on demand, and session limits. The free tier has one-hour session lengths; the $10/month tier has a six-hour session limit; and the $20/month package has an eight-hour limit. However, there is no limit to how many times subscribers can start a new session on any given day.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit the GeForce Now website</a> to learn more. Shadows is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-assassins-creed-shadows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one of 11 games joining the GeForce Now library this week</a> for streaming. Some of the others include Fable Anniversary, Aliens: Dark Descent, and Quake Live.</p><p>Another key thing to know is that, with all game streaming platforms, the experience will depend on the consistency and strength of your internet connection. Players might encounter input lag issues depending on their connection, and the possibility of compressed visuals. </p><p>Beyond Game Pass Ultimate and GeForce Now, Assassin's Creed Shadows is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstore.ubisoft.com%252Fus%252Fubisoftplus%2523discoverLandingOffers&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-dont-need-a-console-or-a-powerful-pc-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows%2F1100-6530260%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to stream for Ubisoft+ members through Amazon Luna.</a></p><p>Shadows is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, featuring the protagonists <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-or-naoe-switch-characters/2900-6333/" data-ref-id="2900-6333">Naoe and Yasuke</a>.
