            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It feels like a long time ago that Saber Interactive and Universal announced<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/jurassic-park-survival--2"> Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.</em> And that’s because yeah, it’s been nearly two years! Since then, we’ve not gotten much else about the game, but earlier today, we finally got some fresh looks at <em>Survival </em>in action.</p> <p><em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person action-horror game set one day after the events of the original<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876"><em> Jurassic Park</em> film</a>. You play as a new character, Dr. Maya Joshi, who is left on the island after everyone else escapes. Now she has to survive (oh, I get the name of the game now) while trying to figure out a way off dino island, aka Isla Nublar. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">The game was announced 19 months ago, all the way back in December 2023</a>, and since then, we’ve not seen much about it. That changed on Thursday with a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal and developers Saber Interactive.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind-The-Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuxDHCY6kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>On August 14, the official <em>Jurassic World/Jurassic Park</em> YouTube account posted <a href="https://youtu.be/lLuxDHCY6kw">a nearly six-minute-long video</a> featuring interviews with various developers and others working on <em>Survival.</em> And sprinkled throughout this video, which is mostly focused on all the movie-accurate details in <em>Survival</em>‘s environments,&nbsp;how it connects to the film, and the new main character–are some new looks at how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dinosaur-games-dino-crisis-jurassic-park-horror-pc-ps5-1851771664">franchise’s iconic dinosaurs</a> will appear in the game.</p>

 <p>Look at that T. rex! I love it! And we get some more glimpses of how Velociraptors and the extremely tall Brachiosaurus look in<em> Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> too. As a massive <em>Jurassic Park</em> fan, all of this has me really excited to play the game. Sadly, we still don’t have a release date for <em>Survival</em>. And I’m not feeling good about it arriving this year. In a press release shared with <em>Kotaku</em> announcing this new video, Saber Interactive explained that “<em>J</em><i>urassic Park: Survival</i><i>&nbsp;</i>won’t be present at this year’s Gamescom.” Maybe it still shows up at Geoff Kielghley’s annual Opening Night Live ceremony later this month, but I’m not holding my breath about that.</p> <p>If you want to kill some time while waiting, you can always watch the original announcement trailer from 2023. It’s pretty cool.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UinsNBOTNyU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-beta-%E2%80%93-how-to-enable-secure-boot.1270629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> Open Beta is currently playable on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC right now until August 17. But PC players in particular learned that they might have to jump through more hoops than those on consoles. If you've been unable to launch the beta due to an error message telling you that 'Secure Boot' needs to be enabled, this guide will show you how to do that so you can get into the action on your PC in no-time.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot">Battlefield 6 Beta - How To Enable Secure Boot</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-is-secure-boot">What is Secure Boot?</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Battlefield 6 will require Secure Boot to be enabled even when the game launches in October.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To put it simply, Secure Boot is a feature available on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 that scans for malicious software, and in this case, cheat software, that could load ahead of your operating system.</p>



<p>It's a feature that EA needs your PC to have enabled, so that it's kernel-level anti-cheat Javelin software can help keep Battlefield 6 cheater-free.</p>



<p>On EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">official website</a>, the company calls Secure Boot being enabled a "<em>requirement</em>" for "<em>enhanced security while playing and utilizing new anti-cheat features in Battlefield...Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process. It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating</em>."</p>



<p>Kernel-level anti-cheat isn't always the most popular thing with PC players, as some see it as giving companies too much access to your personal device. But regardless of your feelings, you won't be playing Battlefield 6 on PC without it. And at least for now, it seems to be doing its job, with EA reporting that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">already stopped hundreds of thousands of cheaters in this beta</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-check-to-see-if-you-can-even-enable-secure-boot">Step 1 - Check to see if you can even enable Secure Boot</h3>



<p>Before you jump down to the rest of the steps, you need to figure out if you can even enable Secure Boot without taking a few more extra steps, like potentially having to contact the manufacturer of your PC's motherboard. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first thing you'll need to do is navigate to your <strong>System Information </strong>menu, which you can find just by searching 'System Information' in the Start Menu on your taskbar. You can also type 'misinfo32' into your menu to open the menu without the need for an extra click.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Once you're there, you'll be checking after the status of two of the listed items, <strong>Secure Boot State</strong> and <strong>BIOS Mode</strong>. If you've been getting the error message that Secure Boot needs to be enabled to run the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, then the former of the two should say 'Off.'</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Regarding BIOS Mode, you want the value to be <strong>UEFI</strong>. If the value is 'Legacy,' than you're unfortunately going to have to jump through a few more hoops to make this work, specifically checking to see if your Windows disk partition is GPT or MBR.</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>You're looking for the settings at the top and bottom of this image.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before we get into that, however, you'll also need to do a quick check that TPM 2.0 is enabled and ready to use. You can do this by typing '<strong>tpm.msc</strong>' into your Start Menu taskbar to find the Trusted Platform Module window, or by entering 'tpm.msc' in the Windows Run menu, which you can access by pressing the Windows key and the 'R' key at the same time. </p>



<p>This is what you're hoping to see when you open the menu:</p>



<figure><figcaption>If TPM is not ready to use, or you get a message that says 'Compatible TPM cannot be found,' you'll need to look to your motherboard's manufacturer for more help.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-step-2-check-your-windows-disk-partition-and-convert-it-from-mbr-to-gpt-if-necessary">Step 2 - Check your Windows Disk partition, and convert it from MBR to GPT if necessary</h3>



<p>Start by pressing the <strong>'X'</strong> key and the Windows key at the same time. That will open a menu where you can then select '<strong>Disk Management</strong>.'</p>



<p>You're looking for the disk where you installed Windows, which is generally marked <strong>(C:)</strong>. Right-click on the number on the left of the drive (which is usually '0') and then select '<strong>Properties</strong><em>'</em> in the resulting menu. You'll then navigate to '<strong>Volumes'</strong>, where you will hope to see the following:</p>



<figure><figcaption>If the partition is not GPT, you'll need to convert it.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If everything up until now has appeared as it should, then you can jump right ahead to the final step of enabling Secure Boot in your BIOS.</p>



<p>To convert the partition from MBR to GPT, start by pressing the '<strong>R</strong>' key and the Windows key at the same time. Type '<strong>powershell</strong>' and in the resulting window, press <strong>'Ctrl+Shift+Enter</strong>' to open a command prompt as an administrator. </p>



<p>Run this command to validate your disk and ensure that the number (which again, is usually '0') matches the number you found in the Disk Management menu: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>mbr2gpt /validate /disk:X /allowFullOS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>If it doesn't match, you'll need to replace it with the matching number. If/when the validation passes, to finally convert your disk partition from MBR to GPT, run this command: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>mbr2gpt /convert /disk:X /allowFullOS</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Once that has completed, head back to your Disk Management menu, back into Properties and then Volumes to ensure that your disk partition has successfully converted to GPT.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-enable-secure-boot">Step 3 - Enable Secure Boot</h3>



<p>After all those checks to ensure that everything is as it should be (apart from Secure Boot already being enabled, of course) we're finally ready to enable Secure Boot.</p>



<p>It's at this point where you also might have to check with your motherboard's manufacturer on where to find Secure Boot in your computer's BIOS. It's worth keeping the official support page for your motherboard open on a separate device, if you have one available, to help you out with this part if you need it.</p>



<p>Start by restarting your computer and entering your BIOS. You get into the BIOS by constantly pressing either the '<strong>F12</strong>' key or the '<strong>Del</strong>' key while your computer is booting back up. It might be different depending on your specific computer, but you should launch into your BIOS by mashing either key.</p>



<p>Once in your BIOS, Secure Boot will usually be found either in your advanced settings or security settings. From there, it should be a simple change to 'Enable Secure Boot,' or to make Secure Boot 'Active' as opposed to 'Inactive.'</p>



<p>You can also potentially hit one last snag here, where you might not be able to adjust your Secure Boot settings. If that's the case, then you may need to find a setting named '<strong>Restore Factory Keys</strong>' or something similar. Selecting that will boot you back into the BIOS, where you should now be able to adjust your Secure Boot settings.</p>



<p>Restart your computer one last time, and then you should have no trouble launching the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. If you still have a problem, then you'll need to go to your motherboard's manufacturer to get a clearer idea of what's causing the issue.</p>

<p>Birdo is one of the primary unlockable characters in<i> Mario Kart World</i>. Being a relative mainstay in the <i>Super Mario</i> spinoffs since the Gamecube era, it’s a little surprising that she doesn’t show up in the game’s roster from the start. With icons like Donkey Kong and Daisy being unlocks too, though, I suppose it isn’t much of a surprise.</p> <p>On the bright side, uncovering her doesn’t take much effort: just four short races and she’ll be in your crew! Here’s what you need to know to get this unusual creature.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-karts-for-birdo"></span>The best karts for Birdo<span></span></h2> <p>As with many other characters, Reel Racer is hard to turn down as the best match for Birdo. That said, you may want to try your hand at the Biddybuggy given its improved acceleration and handling over the Reel Racer.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-birdo"></span>How to Unlock Birdo<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617863"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617863">© © Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If you want to unlock Birdo, you just need to complete the Banana Cup! Unfortunately, if you don’t want to unlock Birdo, she will still unlock after you complete the Banana Cup. Placement doesn’t matter. Whether you win every race or never get higher than 24th, Birdo will still join your crew when the Grand Prix is concluded.</p>

 <p>Birdo is a middleweight character, like her counterpart Yoshi. That means that she is a very well-rounded character, not excelling at anything in particular, but not lacking in anything either.</p> <h2><span id="all-outfits-for-birdo-in-mario-kart-world"></span>All Outfits for Birdo in <i>Mario Kart World</i><span></span></h2> <p>In total, Birdo has two outfits to select from at launch. If you’re mad at that fact, just know that you can’t be nearly as mad as I am that Donkey Kong got a quite short end of the stick with only one outfit. Anyways, here’s a list of foods to unlock those outfits:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Pro racer: pancakes, donut, cake, burger, fruit salad, curry, ice cream</li> <li aria-level="1">Vacation: takoyaki, sushi, pizza, kebab, naan, fish and chips, popcorn</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam, or travel the Mushroom Kingdom in modes like Knockout Tour to get access to a lot of different foods and increase your chances of finding what you need to unlock these costumes. Before long, you’ll find what you’re looking for and get these costumes for Birdo’s wardrobe!</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first time I get a good view of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s Night City is from the window of a private taxi. The driverless flying car departs from a portal high up in the side of my corporate employer’s headquarters and soars over a packed, four lane traffic circle. I sip champagne as neon towers slide past, megabuildings whose gargantuan size would make Denis Villeneuve blush.&nbsp;</p><p>The car is taking me to a bar to meet a friend. As the vehicle swoops down, the automation warns me that there is no suitable landing place for an aerial vehicle. In other words, there’s nowhere to park.</p><p>I override the warning. The cab parks illegally on a basketball court, upsetting the people currently shooting hoops. I punch them in the face, because this seems like the kind of thing a corpo like me would do.</p><p>Parking isn’t a big deal in Night City, because <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is a game and nobody enjoys parking. You can leave your car, motorcycle or neo-militarist armoured SUV wherever you like and recall it later with the press of a button. Cars are almost always in motion, and it’s rare to see street parking or a parking lot. There aren’t even bike lanes; Night City is a place where the car is king.</p><p>Clearly the designers at CD Projekt Red understand what many real world urban planners are starting to grasp: parking sucks the life out of a city. This representation of a car-centric dystopia can’t actually be too car-centric. It’s fun to drive around, sure, but <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> isn’t a game about driving.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were creating a game, an experience that has to be super fun for the player to enjoy,” Kacper Niepokólczycki, environment art director at CD Projekt RED, told me. “You can explore the world in a vehicle, on foot, or swimming. We tried our best to make sure any of those methods gives you a fun and different experience.”</p><p>If only North American cities thought the same way.</p><figure><figcaption>Lots of cars, but no parking. CDPR</figcaption></figure><p>In-game, the meeting in the bar goes poorly, and afterwards I get dropped off by the Kabuki Roundabout. I head into a lively pedestrian market in the centre of the traffic circle. There are street food vendors and a place to buy guns and cyberware. It’s all open 24 hours a day, so you can pick up ramen and a revolver whenever you’re hungry for food or violence.</p><p>Night City is full of places like this: walkable public space with restaurants and retail.&nbsp;</p><p>“In some places we were able to close traffic and create denser crowds — so you can really feel like you’re in the tight streets of an Asian-inspired city,” said Niepokólczycki. “Just like the breathtaking vistas and interesting, layered environments, we wanted to make our crowds stand out just as much.”</p><p>One evening my companion Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) stops me as I pass a busker and compliments his playing. We agree to go check out an old club where Silverhand used to play gigs himself, and are led to a stall in a local market where a crusty old rocker is selling bootleg tapes of Silverhand’s band Samurai<em>. </em>This is often how subplots emerge in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> – chance encounters and following leads.</p><p>The game needs places where the player can walk freely and have seemingly-random encounters like this. For Niepokólczycki, it doesn’t matter if a player only experiences one or two of these chunks of side content; it's about the discovery. “[Night City is] a living, breathing city with its own ecosystem, and you are just exploring part of it,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The same is true in real cities, though on a different scale. A store, venue or art installation doesn’t have to be for every single person in the city, but it can delight some people as they happen across it. One of the most joyous things you can do in a city is to explore and discover.</p><p>“Seeing the amount of YouTube videos of players exploring Night City for hours and hours straight on foot — which by the way, is amazing to see — it looks like we succeeded. I love to watch those videos!” said Niepokólczycki.</p><p>AppleTV’s upcoming adaptation of <em>Neuromancer,</em> William Gibson’s 1984 novel which defined the cyberpunk genre, is currently being filmed in Tokyo. Night City may be physically located on the west coast of North America, but it’s easy to see the influence of East Asian cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo in the bright neon lights and loud advertising. That influence is also there under the city’s skin. It’s in the way that land is used and regulated, known as “zoning” to urban planners.&nbsp;</p><p>CDPR had two urban planners on the development team for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.<em> </em>Niepokólczycki said there was push and pull between the game’s artists – who were excited to draft a flamboyant, futuristic sci-fi city –&nbsp; and CDPR’s urban planners, who “tried to do what they do best — build a believable, functional city that could actually exist. They acted as the voice of common sense.”</p><figure><figcaption>A walkable area in Night City. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>If this were a truly North American city, then vast swathes of Night City would be zoned for residential use only. In my own city, Toronto, this is known as the “yellow belt,” because residential is marked in yellow on the city’s official land use map. You cannot open so much as a coffee shop or convenience store in the yellow belt. It’s all homes, most of which are detached single family houses. This type of zoning is known as “exclusionary zoning,” because it excludes most uses.&nbsp;</p><p>In real world cities like Toronto there have been attempts by urban planners and progressive politicians to do away with exclusionary zoning, but they’re often met with pushback from local homeowners who want to “preserve” or “protect” their neighbourhoods. This is ultimately futile: populations grow, leading to a shortage of housing, while children age out of their parents’ houses and move to the denser apartment-centric neighbourhoods they can afford. Eventually you have what we see in Toronto today: once-lively neighbourhoods where populations are falling and schools are under-attended. Meanwhile, the areas where development is allowed are experiencing massive growth, becoming densely populated with over-used amenities and services.&nbsp;</p><div><p>When you walk through these residential-only parts of Toronto, it’s hard to deny that they’re often attractive to look at but fundamentally boring to linger in. They’re places to come back to after spending the day at work or play elsewhere. They would be untenable in a video game; there wouldn’t be much point creating a yellow belt in Night City.</p><p>Instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>has land uses much closer to that of Tokyo, called “inclusionary zoning.” In Japan, even the most restrictive zoning still allows for small shops on residential streets in the same building as a private residence. This has made Tokyo an eminently walkable city where residents can go about their days without hopping into a car. In fact, Tokyo has the lowest car use in the world. About 12% of trips are completed with a car, whereas 17% of trips are done with a bicycle, according to Daniel Knowles’ book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/730724/carmageddon-by-daniel-knowles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmageddon</em></a>.</p></div><p>In Night City, there are vendors crammed into corners and in-between spaces. Apartment buildings have retail, boxing gyms (or in Megabuilding 8 it’s more of a baseball bat gym), and social spaces right outside your door. When you wander the city you are encouraged to interact with it. That’s true in Night City, as it's true in Tokyo.&nbsp;</p><p>In most games cities feel like they have sprung to life fully formed like a beautiful painting, but that’s not how real life cities are built. The collaboration between CDPR’s artists and urban planners created a city that feels like it has a genuine history. The liveliness of the streets and the chance interactions are a huge part of it, but the aesthetic is key, too.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>"Kitsch," one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>Let's step outside science fiction for a second and take a look at some fantasy cities in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: Rivendell, Osgiliath, Minas Tirith. They’re otherworldly expressions of stone and water, flowing beautifully from one arch to the next. They’re stunning to look at, and utterly unrealistic: No real city’s architecture remains that uniform. Even places like Paris or Vienna, with their great reconstructions of the 19th century, can’t maintain this level of coherence. Humans just don’t work that way; we’re messy creatures, subject to economic pressures and aesthetic disagreements.</p><p>Night City, on the other hand, is an architectural melting pot. Neon signs are everywhere, but the buildings are a chaotic assortment of styles, jumbled and squashed together. This doesn’t mean that the city feels incoherent as a whole. Neighbourhoods are still distinctive, with subtle stylistic variations that give the player a sense of place.</p><p>To achieve this, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s designers created four architectural styles: Kitsch, Entropic, Neo-military and Neo-kitsch.&nbsp;</p><p>Niepokólczycki said that “Kitsch was trying to pretend it looks expensive, when in reality it was a cheap style that used materials and technology that would break or become damaged easily. It was a disposable style in that regard; when something breaks, you just make another one of the same quality.” To me that sounds a lot like the McMansion-style architecture you see in so much of middle America.&nbsp;</p><p>Entropism, on the other hand, is a style based on poverty and a severe lack of resources. In a nutshell, this style visually tells the story of the very poor social layer of our world. Its central motto is “Necessity Over Style.”</p><p>These architectural styles are not defined with great specificity; Niepokólczycki did not say that Heywood should have Mansard roofs and homes in Santo Domingo are built with yellow brick. Instead, the buildings reflect the people who occupy an area. In this hypercapitalist, gun-centric future, Neo-militarism is associated with corporate headquarters; think sleek lines, dark colours, armoured cars and imposing branding. Niepokólczycki told me that Neo-militarism is rooted in the wealth of corporations. “They could afford those corpo ‘castles’ over the Night City landscape that really brandished the Neo-militarism style like a weapon,” he said.</p><p>Neo-kitsch, meanwhile, represents the ultra-ultra rich who can afford such rarities as real wood and animal leather, natural materials that are exceedingly scarce and definitely not disposable in the climate-ravaged world of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>"Entropism," one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>Heritage preservation in North America has historically focused on preserving buildings, not communities. Santa Fe, New Mexico is famous for its pueblo revival-style downtown where the buildings have rounded corners and stucco walls like something out of Star Wars’ Tatooine. It’s an impressive place to be as a tourist, but this stagnation has led to a city centre that feels like a theme park, a Mickey Mouse version of historic Santa Fe where the cost of living has forced locals to move away while rich out-of-towners stay in AirBnBs and gawp.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps we could learn something from <em>Cyberpunk</em> about codifying our architectural styles in ways that relate more to community than cornices. That’s not to say we should design cities like Night City and designate parts of them as entropic, but we should avoid attempting to freeze an area in time. To its credit, the city of Toronto is starting to recognise this. Heritage planner Tatum Taylor is working on the lively Kensington Market neighbourhood and told the Globe and Mail’s City Space podcast (for which I am a senior producer) that “If we were to freeze Kensington Market in time, we would actually be losing what's most important and unique about it.”</p><p>In the 1920s Kensington Market was a hub for the city’s Jewish community. Subsequent waves of immigration from all over the world created a layered and vibrant place bustling with stalls. “You can see the accumulated layers of history within the actual built fabric,” Taylor told City Space. “There are former residential buildings that still have little gables or even half gables peeking up over the roof line of a commercial addition, and that really tells the story within the streetscape of a community coming together in a part of the city to pursue a life for themselves.”</p><figure><figcaption>Neo-militarism, one of Cyberpunk 2077's four architectural styles. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>When he wrote <em>Neuromancer</em>, William Gibson was living in Vancouver. He’s an American who ended up on Canada’s west coast after dodging the draft in Toronto. Most cyberpunk authors are American or British and were publishing between the 70s and 90s. Their idea of a dystopia is informed by that 20th century aversion to urban density.</p><p>Nowhere is that cultural context more apparent than in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s the eastern neighbourhood of Santo Domingo, described in the game’s art book as</p><blockquote><p> a failed attempt to create a suburban utopia of single-family dwellings… verticality abuts sprawl, factories and power plants sit right next to supposedly idyllic residential neighborhoods and the whole urban planning concept of separate functional zones is flipped the bird.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>To Niepokólczycki Santo Domingo represents the fears that many North American city dwellers have about Japanese-style inclusionary zoning. “In Night City you see that clash of different zoning as a direct effect of corporations wanting to have more of the city for themselves. And if there’s no other space to put a power plant, then fitting one next to Rancho works — but it’s never going to be pretty.”</p><p>To the original creators of Night City, this mixed use zoning is a dystopia – and nobody really wants to live next to a high-polluting industrial plant. The single family homes are depicted as dilapidated, occupied by some of the city’s poorest. The cauldrons of industry dominate chunks of land with grey pipes and corroded silos.&nbsp;</p><p>“For the residents of [Santo Domingo sub-district] Rancho Coronado, consumerism is everywhere — with big adverts plastered all over, even in backyards,” Niepokólczycki told me. “That's partially the dystopia: there is no escape from the meat grinder that is Night City.”</p><p>Certainly the urban planning orthodoxy of real world cities in the 50s and 60s was that cities should have a central business district, or a meat grinder if you will, which could then be escaped by car to a perfect, protected home in a suburban development. But in reality, mixed use zoning isn’t a meat grinder.&nbsp;</p><p>There is only one type of Japanese zoning that is exclusively industrial. There’s also commercial zoning, which allows for small factories, and quasi-industrial zoning, which allows for homes and shops. These types of zoning don’t create artificial barriers against the construction of homes in places that might actually be nice places to live, and so housing in Japan is much more affordable than in Canada. This isn’t because Japanese urbanites are crammed into the space between smokestacks and tire factories – not all industries are high-polluting collections of smog-churning machinery. I grew up near Carlisle, a British city that is often blanketed with the rich smell of cooking chocolate from the cookie factory in its centre. Mixed-use zoning allows more where it's necessary and desirable, but under the exclusionary zoning of almost every city in today’s English-speaking world, the apartments and townhouses nearby could not be built.&nbsp;</p><p>If Night City were made reality, those dilapidated detached homes in Rancho Coronado would be multimillion dollar pieces of prime real estate, a rare opportunity to own a detached house with your own yard in a hyperdense metropolis. The real meat grinder would be the traffic on your commute if you lived elsewhere. In a city like Toronto industrial zones aren’t places you linger unless you’re working there. When I pass by a lubricant plant on one of my regular bike rides I speed up, trying to avoid breathing the air. The lubricant plant serves a purpose, but it's kept on the city’s outskirts for a reason.</p><figure><figcaption>Zoning in Santo Domingo. Jay Cockburn</figcaption></figure><p>In Night City there is one purpose: play. Industrial areas are open to the player, and often the site of a shootout or stealthy break-in. The surveillance cameras are tools to be hacked and turned upon their owners. The commute is immaterial: driving is fun in Night City. Traffic has been massaged into an entertaining obstacle to swerve around, and if you screw up and crash your car it’s no big deal.</p><p>We can’t let citizens loose with throwing knives and rocket-propelled grenades in the lubricant plants of Toronto, but we can ask how we could invite people to explore more of the city. Which spaces are underused, and how can we incentivise municipalities and private landowners to go further than just allowing public access, but encouraging it with places to sit and things to do? That could include allowing retail in more places, but it's broader than that. Cities are bad at allowing <em>life in general</em>. No loitering.&nbsp;</p><p>Why do I so often find myself wondering “am I allowed to be here?” when walking through open space in Toronto? Why do we have to check what <em>is</em> allowed, rather than assuming most things aren’t?</p><p>Many North American cities are actively hostile to street life. In 2024 the council in my own city of Toronto voted against allowing small business in residential neighbourhoods. A cafe on the corner of my street is apparently one step too close to the dystopian hellscape of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p><p>When I leave my Night City apartment in Megabuilding 10, it isn’t the presence of mixed retail on my floor that I find dystopian. It’s the smoke that chokes the view from my narrow window, the layers of highway that dominate the space between buildings, the elevator pumping out abrasive commercials selling sex, cyberware and sedatives. They remind me of the ad-laden screens in Toronto’s condo elevators, though those commercials are decidedly tamer.&nbsp;</p><p>Night City isn’t even immune to gentrification: that old club where Reeves’ character Johnny Silverhand used to play concerts has turned into a brightly-lit ramen chain by the time you get to check it out.</p><p>When I asked if there was anything that real cities can learn from Night City, Niepokólczycki was humble. “No, I would not go that far,” he said. “The only rules were the ones that we put on ourselves — which are totally different from the regulations a real, evolving city has to follow.”</p><p>I would argue that municipal regulations are also a set of rules made up by people. Many of them are sensible, and keep us safe – fire codes, for example. Others are more arbitrary, such as Ontario’s recently enacted law that stops cities installing bike lanes where a lane of car traffic would be removed.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want our cities to be more than just functional – if we want them to be <em>fun</em> – we should take a long hard look at the rules and regulations that govern how we build and evolve those cities. I think we would find many of them are getting in the way of creating places that we can truly live and play in.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, this is far from the first time Capcom has been to Comic-Con — the company has attended multiple times over the years. But In terms of Switch and Switch 2 games, the only real new game appearance is likely to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>. But we may get a look at some new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC too?</p>
<p>However, we'd recommend that you don't get your hopes up <em>too</em> much for any major announcements. But really, we'd love to see some <strong>Mega Man</strong>. C'mon, Capcom! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mega-man-is-one-of-capcoms-most-important-ips-despite-no-new-games-in-7plus-years">You said it was one of your "most-important IPs!"</a></p>

<p>One of the greatest racers in the Galaxy, Rosalina, has made her triumphant return to <i>Mario Kart </i>in <i>Mario Kart World</i>. However, she actually isn’t available to choose at the start. You’ll have to do a little bit of searching to find her.</p> <p>Luckily, it won’t take much. Here’s what you need to do to add Rosalina to your crew of playable drivers and which kart will see her speeding ahead of the rest.</p> <h2><span id="the-best-kart-for-rosalina"></span>The best kart for Rosalina<span></span></h2> <p>Luckily, your options for getting the most out of Rosalina are pretty simple: The Reel Racer offers excellent speed to keep you at the front of the pack. The Baby Blooper isn’t a bad second choice if the poorer handling of the Reel Racer doesn’t work for you.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-rosalina-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Rosalina in <em>Mario Kart World</em><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617859"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617859">© Screenshot: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Rosalina is unlocked after you complete the Star Cup of the Grand Prix mode, a fitting place to find the de facto queen of the cosmos. It doesn’t matter how well you do in the races; whether you walk out with a gold trophy or participation ribbon, finishing the four tracks in the Star Cup is enough to add Rosalina to your playable roster of characters.</p>

 <p>Rosalina is a heavyweight character, meaning that she can knock other racers around easier and has a higher top speed. As a tradeoff, she has worse acceleration and handling.</p> <h2><span id="all-unlockable-rosalina-costumes"></span>All Unlockable Rosalina Costumes<span></span></h2> <p>Rosalina has four unlockable costumes to find: touring, aero, aurora, pro racer. Each of these costumes can be found by eating a few different foods. Here’s a list of some of those foods and the outfits that they can unlock:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Touring: Burger, Fish and chips, pancakes, milk, chicken, kebab, pizza</li> <li aria-level="1">Aero: Donuts, curry</li> <li aria-level="1">Aurora: Ice cream, bread, popcorn</li> <li aria-level="1">Pro Racer: cake, fruit salad</li> </ul> <p>Explore the open world in free roam or during your races to find as many foods as possible to dig up each costume! Remember, once you find a costume, it will permanently be unlocked for you to choose on the character select screen to choose from the beginning of any race in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>MicroSD cards are tiny but slow; the M.2 storage sticks in your PC are blazing fast but bigger and fully enclosed. Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.</p><p>Chinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4x2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.</p><p>To put that in context, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/676075/switch-2-microsd-express-cards-where-to-buy">the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2</a> top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation.</p><p>The nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though, and M.2 drives are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23743546/pcie-gen-5-ssd-nvme-drive-speed-test-comparison-hands-on">still faster</a>. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Type</h3></th><th><h3>Length</h3></th><th><h3>Width</h3></th><th><h3>Height</h3></th><th><h3>Theoretical max speed</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mini SSD</td><td>15mm</td><td>17mm</td><td>1.4mm</td><td>3,700MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>MicroSD</td><td>11mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>1mm</td><td>985MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>SD</td><td>24mm</td><td>32mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>3,940MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2230</td><td>22mm</td><td>30mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~8,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>M.2 2280</td><td>22mm</td><td>80mm</td><td>~2mm (varies)</td><td>~14,000MB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Nano-SIM</td><td>8.8mm</td><td>12.3mm</td><td>0.67mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Micro-SIM</td><td>12mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Mini-SIM</td><td>15mm</td><td>25mm</td><td>0.76mm</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But <a href="https://www.biwintechnology.com/press-release/biwin-mini-ssd/">the company’s marketing it</a> for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.</p><p>The company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.</p><p>Two cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714294/gpd-win-5-strix-halo-specs-revealed">the GPD Win 5</a>, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story.</p><div><p>OneNetbook’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHYmUXOap4U">upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet</a>, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.</p></div><p>We don’t have any idea of pricing on these new SSDs, and have seen no product listings for them yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/759624/china-is-about-to-launch-ssds-so-small-you-insert-them-like-a-sim-card]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Over the last month, players from various countries have been reporting issues with trying to use PayPal on Steam. The popular online wallet for PC gaming’s most popular storefront seemed to go into permanent maintenance mode. Now, Valve has confirmed exactly what happened: <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">a recent censorship crackdown</a> led to the loss of global PayPal payment processing in all but six currencies.</p> <p>“In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,” reads a new section of Steam’s purchasing issues FAQ first reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies <i>other than</i> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD. We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.”</p> <p>There was no immediate explanation for <em>why</em> PayPal’s payment processing had changed, even as PC players across major countries like Norway and Mexico found themselves unable to purchase games. “Just when <em>Satisfactory</em> is finally on sale,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1m15oki/why/">complained</a> on Reddit on July 16.</p> <p>But Valve has now confirmed that the changes were directly related to the ongoing censorship campaign against adult content on Steam and other PC gaming storefronts. The loss of payment processing support by one of PayPal’s banking partners “is regarding content on Steam, related to&nbsp;what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard,” a spokesperson for the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-explain-why-using-paypal-for-steam-purchases-isnt-currently-an-option-in-a-whole-bunch-of-countries">told <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>. “In this case, one of PayPal’s acquiring banks decided to stop processing any Steam transactions, which cut off PayPal on Steam for a number of currencies.”</p> <p>While that campaign, initiated by an Australian anti-porn group called Collective Shout, was in response to a small slice of games that included content related to sexual abuse and incest, it’s now led to some players in certain countries being unable to buy&nbsp;<em>anything</em> from Steam.</p> <p>“Been noticing this for quite a bit now, it started off as Paypal being ‘temporarily unavailable at this time’ here in the Philippines when I was trying to purchase games a few weeks ago,” wrote another Steam user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1mjto06/paypal_no_longer_available_in_the_philippines/">last week</a>. “Today, I wanted to pick up <em>Cyberpunk</em> on sale and then I get hit with [PayPal is currently unavailable in your country]. Seriously? Does anyone know when will this payment method be available again?”</p> <p>Steam’s FAQ suggest it’s hoping to get PayPal support for these countries back in the coming months, as well as exploring alternative payment systems. In the meantime, anti-censorship advocates are continuing to flood call centers <a href="https://aftermath.site/stripe-lgbtq-steam-itch-adult-games-delisted">of companies like Stripe</a> trying to reverse the pressure on storefronts like Steam and itch.io.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> content creator believes he has finally solved the infamous Mount Chiliad mystery after 12 years of sleuthing, but some members of the community aren’t convinced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played GTA 5 – and there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold"><u>a good chance you have</u></a> – you’ve also likely heard about Mount Chiliad and the notorious UFO Easter Egg associated with it. In September 2013, almost exactly 12 years ago, eager GTA fans booted up Rockstar Games’ latest sandbox to find a trio of main characters, new locations, and a smorgasbord of mysteries to uncover. Evidence of aliens could and still can be found strewn about the Los Santos map, with players able to discover everything from extraterrestrial remains to crashed UFO ships if they know where to look.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/mount-chiliad-mural-gta-5-1755189791780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mount Chiliad Mural. Image captured via Gator Keys' "The End of The Mount Chiliad Mystery" video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aliens have been a hot topic for both GTA 5’s in-game citizens and its real-life players, but it’s the mystery atop Mount Chiliad that has sent heads spinning for more than a decade. Those who make the trek up Los Santos’ unmissable rocky mountain will notice a small cavern with a strange diagram that features a maze-like pattern and four distinct markings: a UFO, a cracked egg, a person wearing a jetpack, and an all-seeing eye looking down on Mount Chiliad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After 12 years, most GTA 5 fans still aren’t sure what it all means, but content creator Gator Keys thinks the answer has been in front of us all along.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Signs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gator Keys, a popular YouTuber who has put on their GTA detective hat to solve some of GTA 5’s greatest mysteries for the last year, dug into what is perhaps the series’ most infamous Easter Egg with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCoHfn9mf4c&amp;t=2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their most recent upload</u></a>, titled “This is The End of the Mount Chiliad Mystery.” It’s an eight-minute video with an unfortunately anticlimactic conclusion: GTA 5 players solved the mystery years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsS06Ub3Mkc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discovered more than a decade ago</u></a>, players who return to the top of Mount Chiliad after achieving 100% completion will be met with a full-on flying saucer – laser beam noises, flashing lights, and all. As an added gag, this UFO, along with some of the others found in the game, features an FIB logo, representing the Grand Theft Auto universe’s parody version of the FBI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The assumption since GTA 5 launched all the way back in 2013 has been that there must be more to the story than just another UFO appearing in the sky. There are, after all, other flying saucers to be discovered around the map, but Gator Key believes it all truly comes back to that FIB logo.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/gta-5-ufo-1755189923347.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">UFO with FIB logo in GTA 5. Image captured via Gator Keys' "The End of The Mount Chiliad Mystery" video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The whole point of this mystery is to tell us a little more,” Gator Key says. “The reason they put a UFO at the top of Mount Chiliad is to show us the FIB logo spinning on the side of it. This means the FIB created these UFOs. They are the aliens. They are the all-seeing eye.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense – Rockstar is known for using GTA to provide commentary on the real world, and conspiracy theories about aliens play a part in that, too. Just like the players who have obsessed over Mount Chiliad and its connections to life in space, there are those in Los Santos who worship the aliens and tell tales about UFO sightings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also recent comments from former Rockstar designer Ben Hinchliffe to consider. When speaking with <a href="https://youtu.be/R5mzJsGhmr4?si=7fQWCnZcbNeal7cy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GTAVIoclock</u></a> last year, he touched on the great Mount Chiliad mystery, and although he wasn’t directly involved with its creation, he admitted that some Easter Eggs are included “just to mess with people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Mount Chiliad mystery is a play on real life,” Gator Keys adds. “The fact that the government, the people in power, control the population, and we can hit 100% all we like. We can get to the top of the mountain, but the UFO is still out of reach because we alone are not the all-seeing eye.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">They Live</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It would be disappointing to see 12 years of community effort come down to little more than a misunderstanding, but if Gator Keys is correct, then that’s exactly what happened. It’s an explanation that arrives as little as one year away from the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>, and it doesn’t even come close to convincing some of the die-hard GTA 5 fans who have combed over Mount Chiliad for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nonsense. The creator should stop making these types of videos,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1mk3bvg/comment/n7jeqzy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>individual commented</u></a> in a recent Reddit thread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He didn't dig far enough.

Divine remnants and unique beasts created by the gods now roam the land, posing deadly threats to everyone unlucky enough to come across them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, needless to say, this is a dangerous and magical world, filled with remnants of humanity’s lost glory. You’ll embark on a journey — either solo or with friends — to uncover these remnants, explore the vast open world, and help rebuild the once mighty human tribes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That journey will take you through several biomes, each with their own unique challenges. Lushland is plagued by constant floods, the Gobi Desert is home to Fire Ravens that whip sand dunes into fiery storms, and Mount Nyenchen is beset by endless blizzards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To help survive these harsh conditions, you’ll need to build yourself a base. You can choose whatever location you want, and you’ll build from scratch using wood and other materials you gather. You can build your base on the ground or in the mountains to use the environment to your advantage … or you can rise above that environment and build on the back of one of Everland’s giant beasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the world’s beasts can be tamed, from the adorable Owler to the massive Si (pictured below), and each requires a different strategy. Some prefer offerings, while others will only respect shows of strength. The benefits of taming each beast depend on its size. Some can be used as mounts (including flying mounts), but if you successfully tame a big enough beast, you can build your base on top of it — and boom, now you have a mobile base that can travel with you as you explore.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/13/03-1755112369401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While each of the environments has its own natural disasters, they all have dynamic weather systems that will change as you explore. You’ll deal with rain, snow, fog, and certain terrain types will get special types of weather. But you’ll find the weather can cause unique and unexpected interactions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, if you’re wearing the Lotus Suit (a piece of equipment you can craft), it will bloom when it encounters rain and you’ll suddenly be covered in flowers. And you can use hazards like floods and sandstorms to your advantage, luring beasts into them to weaken them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as you probably noticed from the screenshots throughout this article, Of Peaks and Tides’ visuals are eye-catching, built in Unreal Engine 5 but maintaining a distinct identity thanks to its Eastern mythology inspirations. The verdant Lushland looks like something pulled from a fairy tale, while snowcapped Mount Nyenchen is treacherous and threatening.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/14/10-1755196332075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The first trailer and batch of images only give us a brief glimpse of the world, with more reveals and information to come in the future. Of Peaks and Tides is scheduled for release on PC via Steam in 2026, and it’s available to wishlist now.

Capcom quickly became aware of the problem after releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">the major update for the action-RPG</a> on August 12.

                <p dir="ltr">With the official gameplay reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 19, Call of Duty-related teases have begun to surface all across the internet. Even other Call of Duty games aren't immune, as a short vignette has begun playing on screens in Warzone matches--and it features a face that should be familiar to Black Ops fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Call of Duty social media accounts have uploaded the clip, which will randomly begin playing on video screen around the Warzone map. The short video features Raul Menendez, a recurring villain in the Call of Duty world, speaking directly to the player when he appears, and when the clip ends, a Secret Challenge called "Watch Menendez's Threats" is earned.</p><p dir="ltr">"My name is Raul Menendez. As you can see, I am still alive and well," Menendez says in the teaser. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear." 2025 is a reference to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, in which the campaign was set in the year 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 was officially revealed as the final announcement of the Xbox Showcase in June. A recent report claims that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final mission of the Black Ops 7 campaign</a> will be a 32-player multiplayer in an "extraction-based" experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has said he believes Microsoft is at a "fork in the road" and is questioning whether the company will keep releasing consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-two-make-it-cheaper-and-simpler-lets-do-that-instead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, Layden said there will certainly be more console generations to come, but Microsoft may not be part of that story. "Watching what Xbox has been doing recently, I do get Dreamcast flashbacks," he said, referencing how Sega got out of the console business after the Dreamcast and became a software company.</p><p>"I think Sega realized they just were better off being a software house. I think Microsoft is in that same sort of fork in the road. And I don't think their hardware offering is persuasive enough to make up the ground they've lost," he said.</p><p>If Microsoft were to get out of the console-making business, that would indeed be big news--and it would be unexpected given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft just recently signed a multi-year deal with AMD for future hardware</a>. Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room <em>and </em>in your hands," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-now-has-another-job-at-a-different-company/1100-6533857/" data-ref-id="1100-6533857">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-hardware/1100-6522486/">Bond has said in the past</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-gen Xbox hardware</a> will focus on "delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." It remains to be seen what that means, however, as some are theorizing that a new Xbox console could be more akin to a gaming PC. Microsoft is also branching out into the handheld space with its partnership with Asus for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/" data-ref-id="1100-6532506">upcoming Xbox ROG Ally devices.</a></p><p>Layden said he hopes to see some kind of standardization for consoles in the future, and it's his belief that going this way could help the total market for console gaming grow.</p><p>"Can't we look at the game console business kind of like Blu-ray, or cassette, or compact disc, or any other medium where the industry decided we'll compete on content, but let's standardize on format?" he said. "And then let's take that format and license it out to everybody who wants to support it. That's what stops the penetration rate of console gaming, I think."</p><p>For what it's worth, Sony is said to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">new PlayStation console</a>. And while Nintendo just recently released the Switch 2, the company is not likely to give up dedicated hardware anytime soon.</p><p>For now, there is no indication that Microsoft will stop making consoles, but the company has changed its playbook somewhat in recent times. The company is now bringing many of its games to rival platforms, like PS5 and Switch, in a bid to generate more revenue. And the plan is seemingly working, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">some of the best-selling PlayStation games are made by Xbox. </a></p>

<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158062/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>While playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> for this review, I visited an exhibition at London’s Science Museum: <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/power">Power Up</a> – a hands-on tour of the last five decades of video games. There, in an expansive, dark basement, an orange-illuminated wall of computers and consoles took me right through the 1980s. I sampled such delicacies as a flickery <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/spectrum/chuckie_egg">Chuckie Egg</a> on the BBC Micro, an Asteroids-type game on the Vectrex, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> on the NES. It was like an 8-bit time machine, beep-blooping me into any year I fancied, to have a little taste of what was there.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is just like that – except the time machine has taken a wrong turn and ended up in a parallel universe. Here, a pioneering (fictional) company, UFO Soft, produced a snazzy home console called the Lazer-X, then prolifically churned out games for it over eight years from 1982 to 1989. The IRL developers – a group of six indie devs at Mossmouth (Derek Yu’s studio behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>) – calling themselves the “UFO 50 Recovery Team”, unearthed this machine. They also rescued 50 of its games, so the story goes, and lovingly restored them so that players could transport themselves back through “history”.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158064/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>And talk about committing to the bit. UFO 50 opens with the credits (otherwise you’d need to get through 50 games to see them, I guess), in which the team is seen in lo-fi photos finding and rescuing the Lazer-X and its games. Then, you see a screenful of 50 disks, navigated using only the d-pad and two buttons found on the Lazer-X itself. Highlighting a game gives you only the slightest information, immediately creating a sense of exploration. Each equally alluring, it’s almost impossible to choose where to start. Thinking I’d need to play them all for this review, I went chronologically, jumping in with 1982’s <em>Barbuta</em>.</p>
<p>One distinctive thing about the games of the '80s was how unfair they could sometimes be. No tutorials, no hand-holding, but a lot of trial and error. I won’t spoil it, but the first button-press of the first game of the anthology is a joke riffing on that – and a pretty good one, too. 'Barbuta' is a rudimentary Metroidvania which, while rather inscrutable, is full of charm. Before I knew it, an hour had disappeared, and I realised I’d only illuminated one of the icons on the jam-packed game selection screen. Pushing on in chronological order was going to be too workmanlike, so I just started to browse. And that’s where the joy of UFO 50 really comes out.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158065/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In an <strong>Edge</strong> magazine interview in 2024, co-developer and composer Eirik Suhrke explained that the overwhelming one-time dump of 50 games – not gated, not structured – was intended to conjure the feeling of picking through shareware titles or demo discs. You might also say it’s like scrolling through a pile of ROMs. It’s the opposite of squeezing every last drop out of the one game you got for Christmas as a kid: nothing needs to be played for more than a few moments if you don’t want to. Switching games is so rapid and frictionless that the huge catalogue soon merges into one singular game experience.</p>
<p>You might compare it to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare</a> in that regard, but while Wario’s sequences of micro-games immediately dissolved into just one uber-game, the parts of UFO 50 are much more substantial, and the overall game therefore absolutely epic. Its component parts may include relatively throwaway arcade titles, like 'Magic Garden' and 'Ninpek' (although even those bring some good ideas), but there’s also a fully fledged JRPG, a brilliant deck builder, multiple puzzle games, platformers, sequels to those platformers…. These are 50 <em>full games</em>, ready to pick up and put down, like you’re strolling around the Science Museum’s exhibits. Some will land with you, some won’t, but the luxury of having them all there means you’ll dip into genres you might not normally go for. You need only play any game for as long as your curiosity lasts – but too many of them caught me off guard, and the hours disappeared unnoticed.</p>
<figure><a title="UFO 50 Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158063/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In a way, of course, UFO 50 is a study of the real history of games – the conventions, technologies and design principles that all had to find their feet in those early years. But since this is just one interpretation of game history, it’s very strongly subjective. As such, it’s not exclusionary – not the private domain of experts or older players: a 12-year-old in 2025 could pick this all up without ever having seen a CRT. It’s particularly interesting then to consider the personal gaming history of the developers – wouldn’t it be fascinating to know what shaped their fantasy of gaming’s growth through the 80s? Luckily enough, Derek Yu appeared on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/derek-yu-gamemaker-spelunky-ufo-50">the podcast My Perfect Console</a> when UFO 50 launched on Steam, and shared just that.</p>
<p>He told of his experience of <strong>NetHack</strong>, a 1987 roguelike. More than the game itself, the fascination was that he found it on a disk in his house and loaded it up in DOS, not even knowing whether it was a game at all. The pure mystery of that comes across when diving into some random option in UFO 50. Yu also talked about his dad drawing maps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> – perhaps no surprise, then, that 'Barbuta' features a blank grid in the corner of the UI, practically shouting at you to get your graph paper, like a pixelated maths teacher.</p>
<p>While the joyous mystery of flicking through disks is all there by design, there’s one unplanned fact about UFO 50: it took a real-world <em>eight years</em> to make – not the usual two or three. That in itself is an enticing story: while there are rich snippets of the history of UFO Soft’s games and growth, I’d lap up a version of the game that spelled out the true history of Mossmouth and its eight-year quest. Which games came first? What led to what? How were all the inevitable ups and downs?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What stands out about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, Mossmouth’s delightful collection of retro-styled games, is not that so many of them are absolute bangers – although they are – rather, it’s the fact that it genuinely all comes together as a single experience. In this game, you are a visitor in some wonderful exhibition, and UFO 50 is your 8-bit time machine. It's magnificent, and a perfect fit for Switch.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Folks have been modding lightsabers and <i>Star Wars</i> characters into Bethesda’s various open-world games for as long as modders have been poking around in the code of the developer’s Creation Engine. But it wasn’t until <i>Starfield</i> came along that we had a Bethesda game whose setting was naturally conducive to an ultimate <i>Star Wars</i> fantasy. <i>Starfield</i>’s 1000-plus star systems, its gorgeously rendered planets and customizable ships, have begged for modders to transform this vast digital space into a simulation of that beloved galaxy, far, far away. Since its launch in 2023, <i>Starfield</i> has received numerous mods, many of which are <i>Star Wars</i>-themed. But one project, <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/"><i>Star Wars Genesis</i></a>, aims to assemble the best that modders have put together.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="An Expanding Star Wars Galaxy — Cinematic Showcase and Release of Star Wars Genesis V8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC7wvzsH6Kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I recently went through the laborious install process (made even harder if you don’t own a Nexusmods Premium account) and had a chance to chat with the project lead, DeityVengy, about what inspired the project, what it’s been like putting it all together, and what the future holds for <i>Genesis.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>First, let’s back up a bit. <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> isn’t a mod itself, but rather a collection of mods all assembled with a handy installer known as wabbajack. The process of <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/install/">installing</a> will require a Jedi Master’s level of meditative patience. It’s extensive. Needing to click through so many mods, dealing with a few that failed on install the first time (wrestling with my damn storage drives that are always virtually at capacity didn’t help), and then finally running the game with this gargantuan list took me some time. So be prepared for a lengthy and fairly involved process–and know you still may run into some issues while installing or even when you try to run it.</p>

 <p>By some miracle of the Force, I, a woman who notoriously screws up mod installs, had <i>Star Wars Genesis</i> up and running on first boot and…<i>Wow</i>. Despite some framerate issues (I’m only running a 3070ti for a mod that recommends a darn 4090), it is impressive how readily <i>Starfield</i> can be transformed into a <i>Star Wars</i> sim. Some existing planets and cities are lightly transformed from their original state. Mars, for example, and its mining city from the base game serve as Geonosis now. Tatooine, which looks like it uses one of <i>Starfield</i>’s many desert worlds, is now home to a recreation of Mos Eisley–and walking around this dreaded hive of scum and villainy feels uncanny. But it’s not only textures, buildings, and new NPC models that fill the space. There’s a dedicated questline that does an impressive job of repurposing and tweaking the base game’s main quest, Constellation, with modified voicelines that swaps the UC Vanguard for the Empire and the Freestar Rangers for the Rebel Alliance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617838"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617838">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Genesis</i> takes place in an alternate take on what happens roughly 10 years following the events of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. It’s a fitting spot in the timeline for DeityVengy as <i>Episode III</i> is their favorite <i>Star Wars</i> film. “I kinda grew up in the prequel era,” they told me, “and naturally I ended up liking <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.” They credit “shows like <i>Clone Wars</i>, <i>Kenobi</i>, and <i>Ashoka</i>” with having helped rehabilitate the once-maligned prequel era. Bear in mind, though, that <i>Genesis</i> isn’t set on delivering the most lore-accurate <i>Star Wars</i> experience.</p> <p>It’s still working within the bounds of what <i>Starfield</i> has to offer, plus, as explained in <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/lore/">the project’s lore page</a>, setting this mod project in an alternate universe means the player doesn’t just need to “fight the Empire, Crime Faction 1, and Crime Faction 2” as players do in so many <i>Star Wars</i> games that try to stick more closely to the lore. “Just look at <i>Force Unleashed</i>,” DeityVengy says. “Is it canon? No. Is it better than <i>Star Wars Outlaws</i> or the <i>Jedi Survivor</i> series story-wise? Hell yes.”</p>

 <p>Some may take issue with that last assessment of the recent <i>Star Wars</i> games, but it speaks to DeityVengy’s vision of this mod project firmly being “fanon, including what [they] consider the best aspects of every era.”</p> <p>Given the name of the project, I was curious about how this all started. Where does one get the impulse and the fortitude to assemble such an ambitious collection of mods, each from different modders, into one, fully working <i>Star Wars</i> sim? The project, DeityVengy told me, “started as a simple one-off video for my YouTube channel about one-and-a-half years ago. After the initial video blew up and more people got interested in it, I just had more motivation to keep it going and started working on my mods. It really [kicked off] after I made my main quest which completely rewrote <i>Starfield</i>’s main quest, and then there was another spike recently when I replaced New Atlantis with Coruscant.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617843" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617843"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617843">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But even with a love of <i>Star Wars</i> and a host of fans eager to jump into a total conversion project, DeityVengy still had some big hurdles to overcome. “For the longest time,” they told me, “the biggest challenge was a modding limitation that <i>Starfield</i> had for about a year where you could only have around 100 or so mods installed until your game became unplayable.” That limitation proved to be an opportunity for DeityVengy, one “that ended up being the foundation for a few of my big overhaul mods such as Armor Compendium, which makes <i>Genesis</i> possible today. It really just forced me to be concise and organized when I was learning how to mod. Without that initial challenge, the project would be a lot less organized and a lot buggier.”</p> <p>For those of us eager to wield a laser sword (yes, I called it that), there’s a bit of disappointment awaiting you at the end of the install process. “There are a few lightsaber mods out there,” they told me, “but I really refuse to add them unless their implementation is perfect, and that’s just unfortunately not possible without Bethesda releasing their animation framework tools.” Dodging and better third-person melee animations are really what DeityVegny seems to need to make the experience of wielding a lightsaber feel as good as it presently does to touch down in Mos Eisley and chill with some Jawas.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000617839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617839"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617839">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Up next on their plate are some faction quest rewrites. The current mod list features a full rebranding of the game’s factions. House Va’ruun, for example, are now a roaming band of Sith zealots. “I’m taking a lot of inspiration from the success of <i>Andor</i> and am keeping it as a grounded story,” they said about the upcoming faction overhauls. “The Rebellion questline that I’m working on is going to be a much more <i>Andor</i>-esque story where you’re just a regular person solving a problem for the Rebel Alliance.”</p> <p><i>Star Wars Genesis </i>is currently on version 8.2.0, with the project having started in June of 2024 and receiving regular updates since then. The next version, 8.3, is just around the corner, promising over 1,000 new voicelines for the main quest. The install page recommends waiting for this new update if you’re new to the project. At the very least, it’s a good opportunity to do a fresh install of <i>Starfield</i> in anticipation as the process of getting everything up and running is made easier when you completely clear your computer of any trace of the old install.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617840" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617840"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617840">© Screenshot: Bethesda / DeityVengy / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve only spent a couple of hours poking around in DeityVegny’s take on the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, but from the opening moments on, with the iconic sights and sounds of <i>Star Wars</i> filling my eyes and ears, it’s clear I’ll be venturing to this version of one of the most beloved fictional galaxies of all time a hell of a lot more.</p> <hr> <div dir="auto" data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755202910.217459" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755202910.217459"> <p><b data-stringify-type="bold"><i data-stringify-type="italic">Updated, 8/14/2025, 4:15 p.m. ET</i></b><i data-stringify-type="italic">:</i>&nbsp;It has been brought to our attention that&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Star Wars Genesis</i> currently makes use of ElevenLabs AI for much of its voice acting, a fact which was not mentioned in the original published version of this story.

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Introducing New Changes To Steam Store Pages]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-introducing-new-changes-to-steam-store-pages/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-introducing-new-changes-to-steam-store-pages.1270524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting set to launch new changes to store pages on Steam, improving the user experience in multiple ways.</p>



<p>First launching in Beta before being rolled out to the general public, Steam store pages will be expanded to up to 1200px wide, increasing the general viewer space. The main content column that users see when visiting a page will see it’s max width jump from 616px to 780px.</p>



<p><strong>“This improves the shopping experience in a number of ways, allowing for bigger screenshots and trailers, and allowing more room to describe your features in the written description area,”</strong> Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a post on its website</a>. <strong>“Of course the page will still scale down appropriately for smaller screens or smaller browser windows.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the description area, Valve is also making changes there on Steam store pages. </p>



<p>While pages have supported .gif files for years, the company is expanding it to support .mp4 and .webm files. This will allow developers, Valve says, to better <strong>“show off your features, demonstrate specific game mechanics, or just add visual flavor to your store page.”</strong></p>



<p>These new file formats will have some restrictions such as being no more than 100MB in size and 12 seconds in length.</p>



<p><strong>“Don’t worry about specific compression or quality settings, as the Steamworks backend will transcode them into a good quality and light-weight video format that works well when displayed on desktop, Steam Deck, and in the Steam mobile app,”</strong> Valve says.</p>



<p>The updates to Steam store pages, Valve says, will only be in Beta for “a few weeks” if things go smooth. They want to give developers time to upload any new assets if wanted before making the change permanent and public for all users.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch will also fix an issue where achievements earned by a player wouldn't unlock on that player's profile. The patch notes do clarify, however, that some achievements fixed with the patch won't unlock automatically--for example, if the Pro and Expert achievements didn't unlock despite the player after reaching Level 10 and 30 respectively, the achievements will unlock the next time that player levels up.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes post also teases that cross-play will finally be coming to the game in the next major update, Patch 3. "Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce cross-play to the game," the post says. "Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but that’s still to be confirmed."</p><p dir="ltr">Players interested in checking out the changes in Rematch Patch 2 can do so by downloading and installing the Rematch beta app, which is available to all players who purchased the game on Steam. Beta progression is separate from main account progression, however, and only a few modes will be available in the beta test, including the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3v3 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">5v5 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">Customization (only the starting/default items will be available)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rematch is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

                <p>Diablo 4's next class could be the long-awaited Paladin, if the name of an internal build recently spotted on Blizzard's servers is to be believed.</p><p dir="ltr">As originally spotted by Spanish site <a href="http://diablonext.com/" rel="nofollow ">DiabloNext</a> (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/paladin-class-may-join-diablo-4-in-upcoming-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Icy Veins</a>), an internal build for Diablo 4 named "2.5.Xpaladin.67961" allegedly made its way to Blizzard's servers, seemingly hinting that a Paladin class could be in the works.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2.5 numbers in the build name appear to be referring to patch 2.5, which would line up with Diablo 4 Season 11, since Season 9 is currently on patch 2.3. Though it seems unlikely Blizzard would release the Paladin before a major expansion (which would see the build number jump to the 3.0 designation), it's possible some part of a Paladin class might be included as part of the patch 2.5 update, even if the class isn't fully playable or is only included for testing purposes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754"></a><figcaption>The Paladin as seen in Diablo 2: Resurrected.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As explained by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/it-might-finally-be-time-for-paladins-to-debut-in-diablo-4-updated-encrypted-378150" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, previous Diablo 4 builds have used the codename Fenris, making the build name change to Paladin even more curious. The name change could simply be another codename that has no actual bearing on in-game content, like Fenris. Until Blizzard makes an official announcement, it's impossible to know for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Paladin is one of two original Diablo 2's classes that have yet to appear in Diablo 4, and as such is by far the most-requested class among the game's community. It would hardly be surprising then if Paladin does show up as part of the game's next expansion, which is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">arrive sometime in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo content creators have been hyping up Diablo 4's future in recent weeks, with some having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">attended a secret meeting</a> to learn more about what's next and others even <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1956009614019035397" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being flown</a> out to Blizzard HQ to give hands-on feedback on a new feature. Might they be testing the Paladin? That's unclear, but what is clear is that Blizzard certainly seems to be gearing up for some bigger announcements.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's Diablo team has been shaking things up in more ways than one recently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Diablo franchise head Rod Fergusson left Blizzard</a> after five years, and the studio announced it would be making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">big changes to how it talks to the Diablo 4 community</a>, doing away with its Campfire Chat livestreams and instead hosting a live chat through Discord. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">Diablo 4 is also being prepped to release in China</a>, having received government approval last month. Blizzard even seemed to tease <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">new content for Diablo 2</a> to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary, though nothing has officially been announced.</p>

Co-op has always been central to the Borderlands games, as well as its spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, so it shouldn't be too surprising that the feature is back and seemingly better than ever in Borderlands 4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Amon Character Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For one, Borderlands 4 continues the franchise's streak of including split-screen co-op for up to two players, and allowing those players to then take their game online. This means that the game will be able to support a full online party of four players where each duo is sharing a screen.</p><p>The same Wire post makes mention of the fact that Borderlands 4 will apparently have a streamlined lobby system, the ability to freely drop in and out of sessions, and dynamic level scaling, which has long been a staple of the franchise.</p><p>As an interesting new wrinkle, Borderlands 4 will introduce the ability for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/" data-ref-id="1100-6533956">vault hunters</a> to teleport to one another. In the past, Borderlands has allowed for teleportation between fast-travel spots, and even offered vehicles for players to speed up the process of moving through the world manually, but it has never outright allowed players to zip to one another's side in an instant like this.</p><p>The change seems to be motivated by Borderlands 4's new open-world design, which moves the series away from the zone-based approach the games have typically employed. As a result, Kairos, the upcoming game's entirely new setting, is seemingly quite large and designed with plenty of points-of-interest dotted around the map that might draw players in different directions. There don't appear to be systems limiting how far apart players can be, so squads can theoretically divide and conquer during a session and then come back together if a skirmish starts getting too tough.</p><p>Despite the introduction of this new form of fast travel, Borderlands 4 will once again feature player vehicles in the form of the personal Digirunners, and even appears to feature new movement mechanics, like balloons the player can use to zip up into the sky and then glide through the immediate area.</p><p>In short, when you boot up Borderlands 4 there will be a bevy of quality-of-life features ensuring that you and your vault-hunting friends have a painless time getting around and playing together. Borderlands 4 launches on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12, and will be coming to Switch 2 a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-issues-response-to-%E2%80%9Cremoval-of-vigilantes%E2%80%9D-from-platform.1270485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh off the news that it had banned YouTuber and “predator hunter” Schlep from the game, Roblox has taken to its website to talk about the “removal of vigilantes” from the platform. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy post</a>, Roblox’s chief safety officer Matt Kaufman discussed the company’s policy regarding “vigilantes” and why they remove them from the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We have been monitoring vigilante activity on Roblox for some time,”</strong> Kaufman said. <strong>“These groups began by reporting safety concerns, commenting on news about Roblox, and challenging us to do better. We appreciated this feedback and used these reports to improve our safety systems.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman continued to say that, recently, activity within Roblox “evolved”. Rather than just report safety concerns, he said, these people began “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impersonating children and actively sought to connect with adult users</a>“. The conversations would then mimic what they believed to be inappropriate behavior while actively encouraging others to connect on different social media and messaging platforms. These actions would bypass Roblox’s safety systems.</p>



<p><strong>“These were not one-off situations and we saw the behavior accelerating across many accounts,”</strong> he said. <strong>“This activity created an unsafe environment and normalized behavior that is both unacceptable on Roblox and is against our&nbsp;Terms of Use. Our policies prohibit directing other users off Roblox to another platform through chat and having/simulating sexually explicit conversations. These are serious policy violations that risk removal from the platform.”</strong></p>



<p>Kaufman said that none of the activities he mentioned were acceptable on Roblox. He said that the company has teams who are dedicated to reviewing and investigating the reports that are received. </p>



<p><strong>“When we find that violations have occurred, we act in accordance with our policies—up to and including permanently removing users from Roblox and reporting to law enforcement when warranted,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>Kaufman says that due to “privacy considerations”, Roblox can’t let users know if their reports led to any consequences. The company, he says, wants to protect the privacy of users as they work to keep them safe. Roblox, he said, submitted 254,522 reports in 2024 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) while also regularly meeting with the NCMEC to learn how to best support the agency and law enforcement.</p>



<p>It was said that Roblox understands the frustration from players in regards to how they handle reports of violative behavior that occurs outside of the game. Kaufman says that they would often be sent as screenshots from other applications, but they still do their best to investigate the reports. Action, however, can’t be taken without verification or similar behavior being observed within Roblox itself. </p>



<p>Despite these concerns from the community, Kaufman implored users to continue to report any and all concerns they may have so that they can “remove bad actors”.</p>



<p><strong>“Rather than taking actions that violate our policies and potentially creating additional risk, we encourage users to report issues through the official channels so we can investigate quickly and effectively,” </strong>he said. <strong>“We’ve designed our reporting tools to capture details and metadata that a screenshot cannot, including object IDs, avatar IDs, and context. This additional information goes a long way toward helping us investigate reported incidents.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Capcom Will Showcase Its “Recent and Upcoming Releases” with a 90-Minute Capcom Presents Panel At New York City Comic-Con]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/capcom-hosting-panel-capcom-presents-new-york-city-comic-con/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-will-showcase-its-%E2%80%9Crecent-and-upcoming-releases%E2%80%9D-with-a-90-minute-capcom-presents-panel-at-new-york-city-comic-con.1270464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom is hosting a 90-minute long panel at New York City Comic-Con later this year in October, where it will showcase "<em>recent and upcoming releases</em>" in its portfolio.</p>



<p>It's currently the next big showcase we're aware of for Capcom, as the company will also be in Germany next week for Gamescom, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> featured at the annual showcase. Reported by <a href="https://ew.com/new-york-comic-con-2025-panels-game-of-thrones-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-x-men-reunion-exclusive-11790222">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the panel will take place at the con's main stage on Friday, October 10, 2025, at 3:45pm.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Capcom brings to the 90-minute showcase, as for now we can only speculate that it'll be more on Requiem ahead of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">February 2026 release</a>, and potentially another look at the recently announced mobile game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">Resident Evil Survival Unit</a>.</p>



<p>We could also potentially get a better look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, which we know is due out on Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year, but no release date has been provided yet.</p>



<p>Or maybe we'll get a reveal of a brand new game in the Devil May Cry series, which hasn't had a new entry since 2019's Devil May Cry 5, though it was still the company's<a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-is-capcoms-best-selling-title-in-q1-fy2026-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-dropped-significantly-since-launch/"> best-selling game in the first quarter of Capcom's FY2026.</a></p>



<p>Again, this is all just speculation, since New York City Comic-Con hasn't previously been a hot-bed for videogame related announcements and reveals. Anything like a new DMC game or a new game in general is probably being saved for a more game-specific stage, like The Game Awards, which will be about two months away at the time of the panel in October.</p>



<p>Regardless, it'll be interesting to see how Capcom fills up that 90-minute block, and hopefully it's not just news about games in its portfolio that are already out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh Thank God, The Battlefield 6 Open Beta Is Back]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back.1270458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I’ll be honest, this last week I spent most of it sitting around and feeling down because all I wanted to do was play more <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">Battlefield 6</a>.</em> And now, it’s back for one more open beta weekend, and this time around, there’s some new content, too. That will likely help its player count numbers grow even higher as <em>BF6</em>, months before launch, already feels like a blockbuster success for EA.</p> <p>Here’s everything you need to know about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>, including when it starts and ends, what’s included in this new beta weekend, where you can play it, and more.</p> <h2>When Does The <em>Battlefield 6</em> Open Beta Start And End?</h2> <p>On August 14, as EA and Battlefield Studios previously announced, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta returned on all platforms. And this time around, there isn’t any weird “early access” period where you’ll need a code to play. This weekend, anyone can hop in right away and start capturing control points and blowing up buildings.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta started on Thursday, August 14 at 4 a.m. EDT and ends on Sunday, August 17 at 4 a.m. PDT. That means you, and over <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">350,000 other fans</a>, have around 72 hours or so to play more of what might be the best online shooter of 2025. And maybe, if EA is feeling generous, the beta will get extended a bit. It’s happened before. We can only hope.</p> <h2>Is There Any New Content In The Second Weekend Of <em>BF6</em>‘s Open Beta?</h2> <p>Yes! Earlier this week, ahead of the beta’s launch, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options">EA published an in-depth blog</a> about the second and final beta weekend, confirming that a new map and game modes were being added. There are also some changes to how playlists work, with new options that combine some modes and rotate out during the beta.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 EMPIRE STATE PS5 Pro Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7cl2WRcIYc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The big news in weekend two is a new map to explore and blow up. It’s called “Empire State” and it’s set in New York City. I played this map during a preview event last month and really enjoyed it. However, some players might be sad to learn that this new NYC-themed map is not a massive one. We know there are big maps in the game, but it seems we won’t be getting any during the beta.</p>

 <p>Also being added to the beta are two new modes: Squad Deathmatch and the <em>Battlefield</em> classic Rush. At the previously mentioned preview event, I got to play Squad Deathmatch, and it was no good due to tiny maps and <em>CoD</em>-like combat. That’s not the kind of experience I want from <em>Battlefield</em>. Rush, on the other hand, is a fan-favorite mode, and I’m excited to see it return in <em>BF6</em>. There will be some new beta-only challenges, too.</p> <h2>Does the <em>BF6</em> Open Beta Include A Server Browser?</h2> <p>No! However, EA has added a new way to join matches and find specific modes and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta. This new option is called “Custom Search.” Here’s how EA describes it:</p>

 <p>“Custom Search allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p> <p>It should be noted that EA makes it very clear that this isn’t a server browser. We know Portal, a separate mode in <em>BF6</em> that will feature user-made content, will feature a server browser. But the beta and traditional multiplayer in BF6, for now at least, won’t include the old school tool.</p> <h2>Are people already cheating in the<em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">That is indeed a thing that happened during the last beta weekend.</a> Players online shared clips of people using what appeared to be wall hacks and other cheat software during the <em>BF6</em> open beta. EA says it has banned thousands of players and blocked even more attempts at cheating in the beta, but some people are annoyed that the game forces you to use Secure Boot on PC to help deter cheaters, which can be a hassle for some users, and yet still has a problem with people hacking it.</p>

 <p>I’ll say that in my time playing <em>BF6</em> last weekend, I never encountered anyone blatantly cheating. I did, however, run into people using flick aim, a controversial addition to <em>BF6</em> that some players say is unfair and makes the game too twitchy. The idea behind flick aim is that players on all platforms can assign buttons that almost instantly “flick” their character in a specific direction. For example, you could assign flick backward to down on the d-pad and be able to instantly pull a 180 spin at the touch of a button.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While some players aren’t happy about this and have reportedly even accused others online of cheating when seeing them use the in-game flick options, others point out that it gives console and controller users a way to compete with mouse players.&nbsp;Personally, I think flick aiming options in <em>Battlefield 6</em> are fine, but perhaps my opinion will change on that if and when more players start using it and how that changes up the flow of combat in the game.</p>

 <h2>So, Is <em>Battlefield 6</em> Any Good?</h2> <p>As someone who has played every mainline <em>Battlefield</em> game, as well as an incredibly long list of other online shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, I think <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is fantastic</a>. If the full game can match or even exceed what’s in the beta and what I played during that preview event in July, I think there’s a really good chance <em>BF6</em> is a massive hit with both players and critics.</p> <p><em>BF6</em>‘s combat is snappy and feels wonderful, but also doesn’t feel too fast or twitchy like modern <em>Call of Duty</em>. Instead, soldiers have a weight to them, and firefights can go on for an extended amount of time as players lay down cover fire using extremely loud and dangerous-sounding guns. This is the gritty, grounded modern warfare <em>Battlefield</em> game that we’ve been missing since <em>Battlefield 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>I literally felt sad for most of the week, playing or doing anything else. All I’ve wanted to do these last few days is load up <em>BF6</em> and blast some fools while helping my team win. So I’m excited that the <em>BF6</em> open beta is back for one more weekend. Sadly, after this, we’ll all have to wait until October 10 to play <em>Battlefield 6</em> again when it launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. As someone once said, <a href="https://youtu.be/-KJPP7GkuPU">“The waiting is the hardest part.”</a></p>

              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">rotating summer boss fight extravaganza</a> just reached peak chaos. Libra Creature of Night, AKA Equilibrious Beast, is the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-night-reign-libra-madness-orb-sigil-phase-1851782989">latest Everdark Sovereign</a>, turning what was already arguably the hardest boss fight in the game into something even more punishing. But not in the way players expected. Instead of simply multiplying the difficulty of the original encounter, Libra returned with completely new mechanics that revolve around summoning an army of clones that swarm players in the fight. I love it. And I hate it.</p> <p>One of the things I enjoy about FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-endless-mode-datamine-depths-relics-2000616334">weekly Everdark Sovereign updates</a> is that they go live around 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday nights. Everyone logs into the game, goes about their usual runs, and runs into a brand new boss fight with no idea of what to expect. While it was relatively easy to muddle through recent boss fights with the right builds and the right amount of patience, Everdark Libra has been very different. His second phase begins early in the fight and revolves around summoning mirror images of the players facing him.</p> <p>Sure, okay, a trio of invaders. Straightforward enough. But they’re surprisingly tanky and lethal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpxsrq/solo_guardian_is_unplayable_against_everdark_libra/">especially the Guardians and Wylders</a>. Plus, not long after you defeat them, Libra summons even more. Then he starts pelting the battlefield with madness glyphs and projectiles. An added layer of bullet hell ensues. Confidence borne of dozens of back-to-back wins <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpnmhk/what_the_actual_fuck_just_happened/">immediately shatters</a>. Everyone starts running for their lives. They can barely survive the adds, let alone get chip damage here or there on Libra. Meanwhile, cryptic text keeps flashing across the screen as Libra performs different rituals. What does it mean? Oops, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpznvt/whole_village_chasing_our_revenant_we_are_truly/">you’re already dead</a>!</p>

   <p>What makes this whole ordeal exhilarating instead of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp0z5/turning_the_best_boss_in_nightreign_into_a_summon/">just a cheap summon gimmick</a> is that there’s a method to the madness. It just requires you to approach the first couple of times fighting Everdark Libra like a researcher. It trains you to watch the battlefield carefully, analyzing cause and effect, poking and prodding his attack patterns for underlying vulnerabilities that can be exploited. You can feel the chaos change in real time if you’re a consummate lurker on the <em>Nightreign</em> subreddit.</p> <p>So what’s actually going on in the fight? Players have been trained to mostly eschew Libra’s “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1ld9fg7/libras_deals_cheatsheet/">deals</a>” that give powerful buffs with unique and, in many cases, severe drawbacks. He offers them in the field during regular playthroughs and right before the beginning of his boss fight. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpp5cb/enhanced_libra_gimmicks_explained/">In the Everdark version, however, he also starts enforcing</a> them in the middle of the fight, whether you like it or not. You might get infinite flask heals that decrease your level each time or the passive frenzied fire attacks that also build up your own madness meter.</p> <p>Success in the fight requires constant awareness of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpojrc/all_of_everdark_libras_new_effects/">which rituals are in effect</a>. “Preaches Madness” imbues all attacks with madness, which can be used to break Libra as well (madness is one of his weaknesses). NPCs can get summoned almost every minute, but “Incites a Riot” will lead them to start fighting one another or even attack Libra. The longer into the fight you get, the more all of these effects begin stacking. And that’s before Libra uses one of his attacks to partition the battlefield with lines that punish the player when crossed.</p>

   <p>How do you win? Like in most FromSoftware fights, with a combination of patience and practice, which people with over a hundred hours in <em>Nightreign</em> aren’t accustomed to doing anymore. We’ve mastered the game, after all. We should be able to brute-force through any fight on skill and instincts alone. “You’ll need to completely rewire your brain from standard, rushed play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mq4bwu/heres_how_to_beat_libra_patience_and_planning/">one player noted</a> on the subreddit. Everdark Libra isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon. This also requires players to approach how they normally do their daytime runs differently. More focus on stamina and buffs that help with swarms of enemies rather than upgrades aimed at bursting down a single target as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mpw4xr/peak_chaos_thoughts/">are split</a> on whether the whole thing is genius or junk. Some love all of the complex moving pieces colliding into one frantic mess. Others hate fighting NPCs. “I want to fight Libra,” wrote one fan. “Not clones. I want a crazy grand attack. Not whatever that wet fart was.” I can sympathize! My favorite <em>Nightreign</em> fights by far are the ones that focus almost exclusively on the nuts and bolts of managing enemy aggro and frame-perfect dodging. The original Libra fight and Everdark Gaping Jaw both excelled at that.</p> <p>Eventually, winning those fights felt great, even if getting up to that point was sometimes a frustrating slog against my own limits. Everdark Libra is the opposite. Defeating him won’t feel like overcoming some great obstacle. But the experience of “solving” the fight and trying to find a way through all of the chaos more than makes up for it.</p>
