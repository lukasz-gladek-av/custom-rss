                <p>In 2015, developers Pilgrim Adventures and GrabTheGames Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-deed/" data-ref-id="5000-450997">The Deed</a>, an adventure-RPG that upended the traditional structure of mystery stories. This week, The Deed is available on Steam for free for a limited time, but only if you grab it quickly.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2P0BdvGoUo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2P0BdvGoUo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From now until Saturday, September 27 at 10 am, The Deed is free to all users on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/The_Deed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The best way to describe the premise is to invoke the board game Clue. Except this time, you're not out to find the killer because your character is the murderer, and the goal of the game is to get away with the crime. </p><p>Players assume control of Arran Bruce, a man who believes that he's the rightful heir to his family's ancestral home, Dunshiel House. Arran's father disagrees, and has cut him out of the will in favor of Arran's younger sister. For Arran, the solution is simple: His sister needs to die. How she dies is up to you as the player. </p><p>There are ten possible murder weapons, including a rope, a candlestick, and rat poison. Your weapon of choice also informs your decision about who to frame for the crime. Household servants and other members of Arran's family could be the prime suspects, if you play cards right and convincingly leave enough evidence. </p><p>Once Arran's sister is dead and a fall guy or girl is selected, there's one last task. The police send an inspector to investigate the crime and interrogate Arran. If players can't keep their stories together, they might be Columbo-ed and wind up in prison. There are multiple endings and not all of them positive for Arran. </p><p>While The Deed is only available for free this week, GameSpot has assembled our picks for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">the best free Steam games</a>, which you can grab right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy's first online cooperative multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/">did not perform as well as the Finnish studio had hoped</a>. However, Remedy has not given up. The studio has a plan to improve the game in key areas, starting with the first major free update, Breakpoint, scheduled to go live on Monday, September 29.</p>



<p>Breakpoint adds a new playable Crisis mission, Outbreak, set in the Research Sector, where a Mold infestation creates unique challenges and enemies, as well as a dangerous new condition. The developer also overhauled the old Job Board with a Crisis Board, offering curated crises to play that are refreshed every half hour. Four to six Crises will be active at any given time, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs.</p>



<p>Each Crisis has randomized rewards, objectives, and length. Crises in the first two zones have been tweaked with streamlined requirements and can occasionally feature unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. Additionally, the Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to assist other groups.</p>



<p>Following this update, every weapon and piece of equipment in FBC: Firebreak is fully powered the moment you unlock it. New gear is unlocked simply by playing and leveling up, while a smaller set of streamlined currencies now focuses on unlocking cosmetics and Perk upgrades. On the other hand, Remedy introduced a new progression layer with gun mods, of which there will be 27. </p>



<p>Breakpoint also introduces three brand new heavy weapons (Semi-automatic rifle, Scattergun, and Rotary cannon) and three new grenades (Freeze, Healing, and Black Rock). Remedy even increased the enemy variety with five new types: two Mold foes (Mold Walker and Mold Turret) and three new Hiss threats with variants: the Corrupted Ranger, the Corrupted Ranger (Airborne), and the Demolition Expert. The new Hiss threats can be encountered throughout the whole game, while the Mold foes are exclusive to the new Outbreak Crisis.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's also going to be a new tutorial level, orientation videos, and a redesigned early-game flow to make it more accessible to newcomers. Lastly, there's a series of quality-of-life improvements, such as already unlocked Altered Augments and Improvised Devices from level 1. Augments and Devices have been tuned to be usable more often than before and will also have a more substantial impact while playing. Additionally, moving while downed and sliding have been added.</p>



<p>Breakpoint is just the beginning. The next major update, which will include a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, will be released in late November. A third patch will go live in March 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hotel Barcelona Review - Room for Improvement]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hotel-barcelona-review-room-for-improvement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hotel-barcelona-review-room-for-improvement.1309506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is a collaboration between legendary auteur developers Suda51 and SWERY, and when I heard about it, I had to double-check that the two had never worked together before.</p>

<p>After all, their styles feel entirely complementary; Suda51's stylish, totally unselfconscious weirdness seems like the ideal partner for SWERY's maverick disregard for established development norms. That's probably what led to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suda51-and-swery65-team-up-for-indie-horror-game" rel="nofollow">the 2019 announcement</a> that they'd be working together.</p>

<p>On first glance,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>seems like it's going to tick both of those boxes pretty nicely. It's an action roguelite in which you play a lady who's possessed by a dead serial killer, and together, you must hack your way through a series of themed levels taking heavy inspiration from classic horror movies.</p>

<p>What follows is probably pretty much exactly what you should expect from a Suda51 and SWERY collaboration, and while that can sometimes play to&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s advantage, many of the flaws of the two developers are in full effect here as well.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Sure Is Weird, but That's Not Quite Enough</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-eve.jpg?itok=UfuvP0OB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-eve.jpg?itok=P0Oh1nDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As if it wasn't already obvious, this is a Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>The division of labor in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>runs thus: Suda51 contributes the overall world and concept, and SWERY serves as the gameplay designer, so this is really SWERY's baby wearing one of Suda51's characteristically zany hats.</p>

<p>Narratively speaking, however,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>has plenty to satisfy fans of both Suda and SWERY. As you make your way through&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s levels, you'll learn more about the hotel's history, its inhabitants, and even protagonist Justine's relationship with the serial killer Dr. Carnival.</p>

<p>Despite the oddness on display, the story here is grounded enough to follow, and I enjoyed the exchanges between Justine and Dr. Carnival, as well as the bizarre normality of some of the hotel's most prominent employees and guests.</p>

<p>It's a shame, then, that the narrative doesn't have much to offer beyond its initial thrills. We're a long way from the insane head trip of <i>Killer7&nbsp;</i>or the&nbsp;<em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired rollercoaster of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/deadly-premonition" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadly Premonition</em></a>, let alone the sheep-riding rural thrills of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/good-life" rel="nofollow"><em>The Good Life</em></a>.</p>

<p>All of the crazy twists you might expect if you've played past efforts by the two star names here just feel absent from&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, and what few surprises there are feel underdeveloped. By the time the story ends, it feels like&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is as bored with its premise as I was by then.</p>

<p>There are a couple of late-stage moments that recall back the offbeat, effervescent promise of the premise, but by and large,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>&nbsp;feels far too rote for its strange, off-kilter ideas to support.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Feels Janky and Stiff</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-slashing.jpg?itok=bd2qEcm- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotel-barcelona-review-slashing.jpg?itok=JLhYYQb0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s combat isn't its selling point.</figcaption></figure><p>This being an action roguelite with a heavy hack-and-slash emphasis, perhaps the story's flaws can be forgiven if the gameplay is fun. I'll admit to a strange "one more run"-style compulsion every time I failed or completed a run in&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, but I don't think that's because the gameplay is good, per se.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s levels consists of a semi-linear sequence of platforming and combat challenges, with a variety of doors waiting at the end to offer different bonuses depending on which one you enter.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, there's a lack of weight and catharsis to the combat here that proves pretty much fatal.&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>is plenty gory; limbs and heads fly off with gleeful abandon, and a single mighty swing of an axe can easily take out four or five foes at once.</p>

<p>The problem is that the swings don't actually feel mighty. Hitting enemies feels weedy and unsatisfying, and while there's a heft to the parry that threatens to add some oomph, subsequent combos and advantage attacks just feel like depleting a health bar.</p>

<p>That issue extends to the boss battles, too. Each of&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s stages has a boss for you to fight at its conclusion, and while none of them are overly difficult, actually fighting them on a moment-to-moment level doesn't feel like much fun.</p>

<p>Platforming here is mercifully rare and brief, but when it does occur, it's...fine, I suppose, with the exception of the shark-infested bonus stage. That's an absolute exercise in rage-inducing frustration that I would strongly recommend against bothering with.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Is Undeniably Creative</h2>

Since they're based on classic horror properties, it's a hoot spotting the (admittedly rather obvious) references, and the bosses have that classic Suda51 mixture of comedy and splatter-style gore as well.</p>

<p>The employees and residents of the hotel are also a fun bunch to interact with, as are some of the other NPCs you'll meet outside of the liminal rooms and corridors of the hotel proper. Their non sequitur-style conversations are a joy to sit through.</p>

<p>Each boss battle also feels markedly different from the previous one, and they all call on different skills. There are a bevy of fun secrets to discover, and stages manage to pepper interesting new enemy types throughout, keeping things interesting.</p>

<p>It's heartbreaking that&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s core combat and game feel are so mediocre, because with some extra polish and jank removal, this could be something truly special.&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona</em>'s gameplay feels like it does a disservice to its world.</p>

<p>In many ways,&nbsp;<em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>shares a lot in common with Suda51's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadows of the Damned</em></a>; its world is full of life and flavor, but its gameplay is stiff and awkward, letting down the whole package.</p>

<h2><em>Hotel Barcelona&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

It's got plenty of both Suda51 and SWERY's signature style on offer, and if you unconditionally love what one or the other brings to the table, you'll probably find something here to like.</p>

<p>If, however, you're looking for an action roguelite to sate your hack-and-slash bloodlust and you don't have much tolerance for jank, it's entirely safe to look for alternative accommodation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When talking about video games, there’s no place in the world more powerful, more creative, more magical than Japan. The glistening waters of the Tokyo Bay nestle up against looming grey skyscrapers, while vibrant green trees nestle in between. Tokyo is a microcosm of the country itself, the old and the new brushing up next to each other, while nature cradles them both. Lots of the countries I visit feel hard – places born from industry and commerce often are – but the softer edges of Japan’s scenery and history make it all the more inviting, even as I’m shunning the wonders outside for the latest digital wonders inside the Tokyo Game Show 2025</p>
<p>Not immediately though. The entrance to the Makuhari Messe sees us snaking out and around the building, in one of the most orderly and good-natured games expo queues you’ve ever seen. Admittedly, this is the opening of the first business day, so it’s only press, devs and corporate types, but compared to the scrum at Gamescom, it’s thoroughly genteel.</p>

		
		

<p>That’s soon forgotten as the barrage of noise and neon lighting inside is only amplified by the corridor of tote bags, posters, fans and other paraphernalia as you walk into the Messe. It is actually in Chiba and isn’t quite in Tokyo, if we’re being honest, but let’s forget that for now. Lots of shows like to lather you up with the odd bit of tat, but the free stuff is out in force here, with many of the multitude of booths offering you a collectable prize for taking part or completing a section of their game. Am I going to play Professor Layton in Japanese in order to get a keyring? Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>It says something that the first game I’ve played today had me hooked up to an electric shock machine. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/let-it-die-inferno-is-a-brand-new-full-price-entry-in-the-roguelike-series/">Let It Die: Inferno</a> might not have actually killed me, but the extensive health form I had to fill out before taking part did make me question how smart I was for playing a game that’s hooked up to the electrical grid. I don’t have a pacemaker though, and if we’re being honest, I’m not that smart, so let’s carry on with the game-based torture. Getting hit here didn’t just cost HP, it cost the seat of my pants, and if you took damage… well, you took actual damage. I don’t think a game has ever taught me to be careful and block quite so quickly, though, so perhaps this is the future?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Let it Die: Inferno - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMwZTM3dJMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that even if I was here for a month, I wouldn’t be able to play everything at this show. The number of booths, the number of games, has eclipsed anything I’ve seen before at Gamescom, GDC or EGX, and I can’t quite reason out the fact that today is a business-to-business day, so should in theory be quieter. The 30-degree heat outside slowly creeps in through the doors, and into the afternoon, the Makuhari Messe turns into a sweatbox, fuelled by the bodies of thousands of people and thousands of PCs pumping out heat. It’s still a lot of fun.</p>

<p>There’s a great deal of queueing though, and I can only guess that the visiting as part of the general public would only let you see one or two major games. The most popular ones here today – those on Sony’s booth or one or two of the biggest publishers – are shut closed by midday, filling their quota without a thought, and giving the lucky few a chance to lord it over their friends with tales of Resident Evil Requiem and Ghost of Yotei before release.</p>
<p>It’s always an odd thing to play games at a show. Just enough to titillate and build your excitement and just enough to make the remaining time until it launches utterly excruciating. For the first time in a while, a number of the titles on the TGS show floor aren’t out until 2026, and that level of separation from your initial trial until they appear almost seems unfair. It’s clear that the public at large don’t seem to feel that – interest for the show is at its height – but this is a show where I simply want to play everything I’ve seen, now. I guess I’ll have to wait like everybody else, and stop acting like a petulant child. That’s harder than you might think.</p>

<p>My highlights on day one have been the bevy of Monster Hunter titles over at the Capcom booth. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-takes-the-series-mythology-in-a-new-and-exciting-direction/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a> are right up my Monster Hunter street, and with Wilds currently losing out to World in our household, it’s clear that we need more Monster Hunter as soon as possible. Besides that, Morbid Metal is fantastic, with its fast-paced Roguelike combat looking and feeling amazing, while Project Motor Racing has me really hoping for a return to form for the spiritual successor to Project Cars.</p>
<p>What’s always nice about game shows is getting to meet up with friends, devs and PR folk – this was the first time I was able to meet our US-based writer Miguel in person! I also enjoyed being fooled by Google maps into thinking everything was ten minutes away from my hotel, but only if I was a car, and I have walked very slowly around most of Chiba today. I can thoroughly recommend the Makuhari Brewery if you’re into craft ale, and I’ve also learned that anime is thoroughly true to life, with the sound of Cicadas ringing out so loudly that I’m glad my hotel isn’t near any trees. On the seafront, I also saw a group of three Japanese students – two boys and a girl – and can only assume that they’re currently fighting demons or travelling through time, as that’s the start of every anime I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The sun set on the first day of the Tokyo Game Show a while ago – who knew that the other side of the world has a different season going on? – but it’s clear that the Japanese development scene, and the wider development community, still place TGS at the centre of their plans. As day two is close – closer perhaps than it should be – my biggest problem is working out what on earth I’m going to play. If today is anything to go on, we are truly living in a golden age of game development, and there’s a huge number of games that deserve to find an audience. I’ll do my best to find them tomorrow.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-admits-mistake-with-new-payday-2-subscription-and-price-increase-of-infamous-collection-dlc-bundle.1309500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently introduced an optional Payday 2 subscription</a> that automatically includes access to all the many (over 65) DLCs available for the cooperative heist-based first-person shooter game. Subscription options include a monthly and auto-renewing $4.99 fee or a biannual $19.99 fee (discounted by 31% compared to the monthly one).</p>



<p>If players subscribe and subsequently cancel at a later date, they get to retain any progress made (level, money, and inventory). However, any DLC content in their inventory, such as weapons, characters, heists, or masks, will become unavailable. Access can be regained by renewing your subscription or by purchasing the relevant DLC.</p>



<p>However, alongside the introduction of this new subscription model, Starbreeze also reduced the discount on the popular Infamous Collection bundle, which includes all the Payday 2 DLCs released so far, from 52% to 33%. This led to a community outrage that brought recent user reviews on Steam down to 54% (overall reviews are at a healthy 87%), as fans likened it to a scummy move to get people on board with the new subscription option. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PAYDAY 2: Subscription Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1BeTuIJOi8U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-dropped-the-ball-starbreeze-admits-it-botched-payday-2-subscription-rollout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to the website Game Developer</a>, Gustav Nisser (Head of Commercial at Starbreeze) admitted the mistake, adding that the Payday 2 Infamous Collection bundle has had its discount restored to 52%.</p>



<p><em>We dropped the ball on coordinating internally and communicating with our community properly. The negative reaction makes complete sense, and the community has made it clear how the price change and its timing looks from the outside. We agree with the community, we messed up on this one, and we have reverted the price on the bundle effective immediately. In hindsight, we should have realized how it would seem. Since the bundle only charges for the items you don't own, and the bundle discount is cumulative with any other discounts (i.e., discounts on the included items), the actual full price of the bundle can vary significantly.</em></p>



<p>Given <span>Payday 3's commercial failure (<a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank">certified by Embracer</a>, the parent company of game publisher Deep Silver), Starbreeze should exercise</span> a little more care when it comes to its most prized game IP. </p>



<p>The Swedish studio's next project is, however, based on a popular licensed franchise: Dungeons and Dragons. The so-called Project Baxter, an online co-op game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-is-still-in-pre-production-yet-starbreeze-says-its-on-track-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is supposed to launch in 2026</a>.</p>

            <p>After much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">hemming and hawing</a>, Asus and Microsoft are finally ready to talk pricing on their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PC</a> team-ups, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. It’s nothing too egregious in the King’s sterling, with the Xbox ROG Ally confirmed at £499.99 and the Xbox ROG Ally X at £799.99 – while hardly chump change, these are pretty standard prices for entry-level and premium portables respectively.</p>
<p>Those in the US, however, will be paying $599.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally and $999.99 for the ROG Xbox Ally X, the latter representing a big increase on Asus’ current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a> model.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That, at least, won’t quite make it the most expensive Windows handheld around, as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-review">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> has also hit (give or take a penny) the one-grand mark in recent months. But still, this looks an awful lot like the effects of US tariff policies, with the added cost of importing Taiwan- and China-made hardware being passed down to aspiring owners. It’s a process Microsoft’s console business will be familiar with, its current generation of lounge-dwelling Xboxes having hiked their prices twice in the past year, with big green fingers pointing at macroeconomic conditions on both occasions.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s UK price merely matches that Asus’ 2024 predecessor, while upgrading its innards with a newer, faster AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU. The ROG Xbox Ally, mind, still seems like something of a wildcard. It’s only £21 more than the equivalent 512GB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, and £50 less than the already budget-minded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-review">Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS</a>. Yet mystery surrounds its own APU, the Ryzen Z2 A, a chip whose four cores and ageing RDNA 2 graphics processor gives it specs largely in line with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>. If performance is a match as well, then it’ll struggle with the GPU-threshers that are modern 3D games.</p><p>That said, Microsoft and Asus aren’t just banking on framerates. The ROG Xbox Ally duo will be the first Windows 11-powered handhelds to include the operating system’s new, bespoke, Xbox-branding gaming mode, where many of Win11’s extraneous guff remains switched off at launch to preserve speed and batter life. It’ll have a more handheld-friendly UI than standard Windows as well, potentially wiping out a major advantage that SteamOS has always held over its desktop-tuned rival.</p>
<p>I’ll be seeing whether this mode will be worth the money, especially for stateside punters, with a review prior to the handhelds’ October 16th launch date. That’s assuming they’re not partaking in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">ongoing boycott calls</a> against Microsoft for their alleged dealings with the Israeli military, including providing access to Azure cloud storage and AI tools for the purpose of running a mass surveillance programme against Palestinians. Microsoft have, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">reportedly</a>, since revoked this access.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it's not ruling out a higher frame rate on Switch 2 just yet, with the team already "investigating" if it's possible to implement a performance mode post-launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ygvurq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>"<em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode.</em> Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for a Switch 2 demo, there's nothing planned ahead of the launch, but there is apparently something in the works for post-launch.</p>
<p>Playtonic's limited time with Switch 2 development kits isn't an isolated issue, with many third-party and indie teams citing how these kits have been in short supply.</p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is releasing for Switch 2 on 9th October 2025 and will be available as a digital and physical purchase.</p>

<p>It's been previously noted how this title was lacking modes and certain features, and it seems this latest update has improved the overall experience. For starters, it's now possible to play local wireless games (supporting up to 8 players), and apart from this, there are some handy updates to the game's 'Online' mode and fixes to go with it.</p>
<p>As usual, here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0znslgy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<li>The game will now display version information.
<ul>
<li>Select the Help tab of the X Menu to view it.</li>

<li>Changed the game start position for 2-on-2 games in public parks.</li>
<li>The game will now display the score when using the spectator camera.</li>
<li>Like offline bots, online bots will now pass to players when they raise their hands or use the “Hey” reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes no record is made under Search for Users You’ve Played With.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes crash when starting up the game or heading to a park.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shot success rate for shots made immediately before landing was based on the position where the shot was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success rate for shots is affected by the distance to the hoop (how close the player is to the hoop) and the player’s orientation towards the hoop (how directly the player is facing the hoop).</p>
<p>In order to make it so that bunny-hop shots while approaching did not become excessively advantageous, the intended design was to calculate shot success rate for distance to the hoop based on the last point of contact with the ground (the jumping off point).</p>
<p>However, just for when the player took a shot immediately before landing, the shot success rate was being calculated based on the position where the shot was made, which was not intended, so we have fixed this.</p>
<p>However, there are no changes to the success rate for orientation towards the hoop.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about this game in our review here on Nintendo Life. If not, here's a quick sample where we said it was a well-made sports game, even with the lack of options and control hurdles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans."</p>

<p>"I wanted to mention that at the end of the year, a demo is coming out for Switch 2 and Xbox. Players who might still be on the fence or unsure about playing, it’d be great for them to experience."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds how it will also give players the chance to "feel the full specs" of the game on the Switch 2. This demo is once again planned for "the end of the year", so if we hear any formal announcements or updates from Square Enix between now and then, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Last month, Square Enix confirmed this game would run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while "offering smooth performance and crisp visuals".</p>

<p>The next entry arrives on Switch 2 in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's amiibo series has got a boost in recent times, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> package.</p>
<p>Third-party developers such as Capcom have also continued to build the amiibo line. And now, following its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series, the same company is teasing at least three new amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>This game is due out next year on 13th March 2026, so we'll likely see them show up on this date, or at least nearby. This information comes from this year's Tokyo Game Show, with the company displaying these unannounced amiibo at its booth this week (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1npv7fv/tokyo_game_show_mh/">Amiibo News via MonsterHunter subreddit</a>):</p>

<p>Capcom previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> amiibo for the second entry in the series. These were released during the Switch generation and included Ena, Razewing Ratha and Tsukino, and all of them were released alongside the game. There was also a series for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/monster_hunter_stories_gets_three_shiny_new_amiibo_figures">original 3DS release</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this latest amiibo update, Capcom has shared an "extended cut" of the Monster Hunter Stories 3 release date trailer. The launch date was originally shared earlier this month during the Nintendo Direct broadcast. Here's a bit about this new version of the trailer, and you can see it in action at the top of this page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Watch an extended version of the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Release Date Trailer, featuring a deeper look into the game's story, characters, and world! Plus, get a first look as an electrifying foe emerges from the Forbidden Ground."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, Microsoft and Asus are officially opening preorders for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a> at $599 and $999 respectively in the US. They’re $799 CAD and $1299 CAD in Canada, €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia. They both ship October 16th.</p><div><p>(In the United States, the Xbox Ally X will be exclusive <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Frog-xbox-ally-x-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-ai-z2-extreme-processor-24gb-with-1tb-ssd-windows%2FJJGHGPLVHW" rel="sponsored">to Best Buy</a>, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nv00h2-m003l0-rog-xbox-ally-x-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally-x/8mzbmmcjzns9/">Microsoft</a>; the Xbox Ally is going wider at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM6C3ZMN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Frog-xbox-ally-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-a-processor-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-windows%2FJJGHGPGFL4" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FROG-Xbox-Ally-2025-RC73YA-XB-ALLY-Z2A-16%2F17398308268" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally/8mzbmmcjznt5/">Microsoft</a>, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nv00g1-m001b0-rog-xbox-ally-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.antonline.com/Asus/Electronics/Gaming_Devices/Handheld_Game_Consoles/1529274">Ant Online</a>.)</p></div><p>There’s a few different ways to look at those prices. If you’re used to console pricing, Microsoft’s first Xbox handhelds are not cheap! Even the vanilla white Xbox Ally costs $150 more than a Switch 2, which was itself criticized for price, and it costs $100 more than a far more powerful Xbox Series X did at launch in the US, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Microsoft’s new Xbox price hike notwithstanding</a>. In Europe and the UK, the weaker of the two Allys costs the same as an Xbox Series X.</p><p>But you can’t play <em>that</em> Xbox in a passenger seat. And if you’re a PC gamer, or want to be, things look a bit rosier. These “Xbox” handhelds will be the first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">a new build of Windows</a> that hides the desktop and Explorer shell, frees up gobs of memory for your games, and (hopefully) lets you navigate solely by controller.</p><p>Handhelds have unfortunately been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">getting pricier</a> and pricier anyhow, to the point flagship ones now cost as much as gaming laptops. At $999, the Xbox Ally X might compare well to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">$999 MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">$1,349 Lenovo Legion Go 2</a> that offers the same AMD Z2 Extreme chip you’ll find here — particularly because my colleagues and I agree the new Allys have one of the most comfortable designs we’ve held. (In summary: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial">Prongs rock</a>.)</p><p>Just know you’re getting a wildcard if you opt for the $599 Ally, as it contains a never-before-seen Ryzen Z2 A processor that’s much more like the chip in the Steam Deck. Instead of 8 Zen 5 CPU cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores designed to run between 15 and 35 watt TDP, you’re getting 4 Zen 2 CPU cores and 8 RDNA 2 GPU cores designed to run between 6 and 20 watts for lower performance gaming.</p><p>We’re planning to have reviews of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X in the coming weeks.</p><p>Microsoft says they’ll be available in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam — and will additionally come to Brazil China, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines and Switzerland.<a href="https://youtu.be/-pPqcWGnVDk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder]]></content:encoded>

The indie survival game was one of our favorite releases of the year, and soon it's getting a big new expansion, Whisper in the Woods, later in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9246706593a32"><a title="Bowser &amp; Doug Bowser" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9246706593a32/bowser-and-doug-bowser.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the President and Chief Operating Officer of Nintendo of America Doug Bowser will be retiring at the end of the year, on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>His replacement has already been named — Devon Pritchard, who has been at NoA for 19 years and is currently the Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing &amp; Communications. As part of the move, Pritchard will also be joining the NoA Board of Directors and will become a Nintendo Co., Ltd Executive Officer when she takes over.</p>
<p>Other changes are coming, too: Satoru Shibata will be taking over as Chief Executive Officer, in addition to maintaining his position as Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director of NCL. Shibata has been the president of Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of Australia previously.</p>
<p>Bowser's departure is a bit of a surprise to us — he joined the company back in 2015 as the Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing, before taking over as President of NoA in April 2019 after Reggie Fils-Aimé stepped down.</p>
<p>Here is his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong. Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President of Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa, has thanked Bowser for his work with the company, saying that he brought "smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo."</p>
<p>"I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years." Furukawa continues, "I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles.”</p>
<p>Pritchard, who will be stepping into her new role on 1st January 2026, says that “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish."</p>
<p>Her history with the company has been varied, with roles across Business Affairs, Marketing, and Publisher Relations, and her aim is to put Nintendo fans first: "With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We wish Doug Bowser all the best for the future, and we're excited to see Pritchard step into the role.</em><em><br></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement]]></content:encoded>

In the press release, she said she's "humbled" by the promotion and focused on Nintendo's legacy of "surprising and delighting" fans.</p><p>"I am humbled and excited to take on this new role," she said. "Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa thanked Bowser for his "numerous contributions" while saying he's confident that Pritchard will "continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles."</p><p>Pritchard will join NOA's Board of Directors and become an Executive Officer.

                <p>With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.</p><p>There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.</p><h2 id="When_does_Fortnitemares_2025_start_">When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?</h2><p>We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879"></a><figcaption>What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_collaborations_are_we_expecting_for_Fortnitemares_2025_">What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?</h2><p>It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The buzz is</a> that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1964043989398491543" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year</a>--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1965123026233819314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> R.E.P.O.</a>, though we don't know what exactly that will involve.</p><p>Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.</p><h2 id="Will_there_be_any_original_Fortnitemares_skins_">Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?</h2><p>It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year,<a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's looking like we're getting</a> a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065"></a><figcaption>Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Fortnitemares_2025_gameplay_changes">Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changes</h2><p>The start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.</p><p>So far, only two changes have leaked so far. It's rumored that there will be a <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953356487075545093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Voorhees medallion</a>, which has an unknown function, and also that there will be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1966950593307545947" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mythic version of Ghostface's trademark knife</a>.</p><p>As more is discovered about Fortnitemares 2025, we'll update this space, so look for frequent updates here as Epic's spooky season creeps ever closer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For years (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-retires/">since 2019, to be exact</a>), the Nintendo of America president was Bowser. Not really the fictional King of the Koopas, but Doug Bowser, a man who was practically destined to work at Nintendo with that kind of last name. That era is coming to an end, however, as Doug Bowser and Nintendo <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">have announced he will retire at the end of 2025</a> from his role as president of NOA and chief operating officer. Devon Pritchard, the executive vice president of revenue, marketing, and consumer at Nintendo, will be taking his place.</p>



<p>Along with Bowser leaving his role and Pritchard stepping in, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as its chief executive officer, while maintaining his role in Nintendo Co. Ltd as managing executive officer, board member, and corporate director. Pritchard will also become a member of the board of directors at NOA and a Nintendo Co. Ltd executive officer. </p>



<p>"<em>One of my earliest videogame experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong</em>," Bowser said in a press release. "<em>Since that time,</em> <em>all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family.</em> <em>Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon's track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence she will guide the company to even greater heights</em>."</p>



<p>For her part, Pritchard added, "<em>I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.</em>"</p>



<p>As Bowser departs, Nintendo Co. Ltd president Shuntaro Furukawa added, "<em>During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo's important mission of creating smiles</em>."</p>

The change means developers can now use the tool and its underlying framework to create realistic 3D characters for their games and apps.</p><p>Nvidia’s <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/audio2face/latest/overview.html">Audio2Face</a> works by analyzing the “acoustic features” of a voice, allowing it to generate animation data that it maps to the 3D avatar’s facial expressions and lip movement. The company notes that developers can use the tool to create 3D characters for pre-scripted content, as well as for livestreams.</p><p>Some developers have already used Audio2Face in their games, including <em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</em> creator Farm51, as well as the developers of <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition.</em></p><p>In addition to open sourcing the Audio2Face models and software development kits, Nvidia is making the tool’s training frame available, allowing users to tweak its models for different use cases.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785981/nvidia-audio2face-ai-voice-animation-open-source]]></content:encoded>
