            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums span a massive price spectrum where premium models costing $1,000 to $2,000 deliver great performance across all metrics while budget options fluctuate wildly in quality and reliability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">At $249, down from $449, the iRobot<em> Roomba 105</em> (with auto-empty dock) represents the sweet spot where proven brand reliability meets accessible pricing during Black Friday</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p>iRobot dominates the category through decades of refinement that established <strong>Roomba as the generic term for robot vacuums</strong>, similar to how Kleenex represents tissue. This r<strong>ecord-low deal includes the game-changing auto-empty dock</strong> that transforms occasional convenience into genuine hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>75-Day Self-Emptying That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The auto-empty dock empties the robot’s dustbin automatically after each cleaning session, and it compresses the dirt into a <strong>big bag that needs to be changed about every 75 days in normal household conditions</strong>. This longer maintenance schedule turns robot vacuums from things that need to be cleaned every week into real <em>“set-and-forget”</em> cleaning tools that can run on their own for months.</p>



<p>The<strong> 70x power-lifting suction of the new Roomba 600 series creates real cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines and picks up fine dust particles from hardwood floors. This suction power is on par with that of upright vacuums and it comes from small robotic shapes. This means that robot vacuums can do the same job as traditional vacuums without needing to be used with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>three-stage cleaning system</strong> has a strong suction and a brush that works on both carpet and hard floors. It also has an edge-sweeping brush that pulls dirt out of corners and baseboards that the main brushes can’t reach.</p>
<p><em>ClearView</em><strong> LiDAR navigation maps your home</strong> by measuring distances with lasers, and this makes accurate floor plans that let you clean each room in a planned way instead of randomly bumping into things. The LiDAR sensor accurately measures how far away walls and other obstacles are, and this makes cleaning paths that cover the whole floor plan without missing any spots or having to clean the same areas over and over.</p>



<p>You can<strong> program certain rooms to be cleaned based on your daily schedule</strong> so you can focus on cleaning the areas where you actually live instead of spreading the battery evenly across the whole house: Plan to clean the kitchen after dinner, the bedroom before bed or the living room before guests arrive. You can change the cleaning passes and suction levels to fit the area: For example, you can use the most power on carpets that get a lot of traffic and save battery on areas that don’t get used as much</p>
<p>The <strong>iRobot Home app gives you full control over your robot</strong> and allows you to set up custom cleaning schedules, get time estimates for different tasks, keep an eye on the filter’s life, and set up virtual keep-out zones that stop the robot from going into certain areas. Without physical barriers getting in the way, you can make invisible walls around pet food bowls, fragile floor vases, or rooms that are being remodeled.</p>
<p>At $249, the iRobot Roomba 105 is at 45% below retail this Black Friday. If you want great hands-off floor cleaning with proven brand quality, this record-low price makes premium robotic cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-65-oled-s90f-tv-hits-all-time-low-2025-model-now-cheaper-than-last-years-version-2000648184</link>
            <guid>1366882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung committed fully to Black Friday by discounting every product category and Amazon delivering the most aggressive pricing across smartphones, tablets, earbuds, and TVs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/">At $1,397, down from $1,997 ($600 off)</a>, the <strong>65-inch OLED S90F featuring the NQ4 AI Gen3 processor, 4K AI upscaling, OLED HDR+, and 144Hz Motion Xcelerator</strong> is the pinnacle of Samsung’s display technology at a record-low price.</p>
<p>This deal applies across all size variants, though the <strong>65-inch model dominates sales</strong> through optimal balance between screen real estate and living room proportions. The 30% discount makes OLED technology accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier LED TVs just years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Neural Network Processing That Changes Content</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen3 processor uses 128 dedicated neural networks</strong> that have been trained on millions of images to look at content frame by frame and make smart improvements that make the picture quality much better. The AI can tell the difference between sports, movies, news, and games and then it processes each type of content in the best way for that type: Sports broadcasts get motion smoothing that cuts down on blur when the camera pans quickly; Movies keep the cinematic frame cadence without the soap opera effect that aggressive processing makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K AI upscaling uses the same neural network architecture</strong> to look at lower-resolution content and intelligently fill in missing details to make it look like it was shot in 4K. Cable broadcasts, streaming services that deliver 1080p and older content libraries all get sharper and clearer when you play them back because of edge enhancement, texture synthesis, and noise reduction. The upscaling is especially useful because the content mixes true 4K productions with upscaled or natively lower-resolution material, which keeps the visual quality the same no matter where it comes from.</p>
<p>OLED technology uses self-emissive pixels that <strong>turn completely off when showing black</strong> instead of backlights that leak through, and this gives you perfect blacks and infinite contrast. This basic benefit makes picture quality that LCD panels with local dimming can’t match: It shows shadow detail in dark scenes while keeping bright highlights without blooming or haloing. With HDR content, stars shine against really black space backgrounds, and horror movies show intentional shadow detail instead of washing everything gray.</p>



<p>Motion <em>Xcelerator</em> 144Hz makes motion look smooth by using high refresh rates and smart frame interpolation to cut down on judder and blur during fast action. VRR support <strong>up to 4K 144Hz is good for gaming</strong> because it stops screen tearing and keeps input lag low, which is important for competitive play. When cameras move quickly, sports broadcasts become clearer.</p>
<p>Samsung <em>Vision AI</em> uses scene-by-scene analysis to adjust brightness, contrast and color saturation based on the content and the lighting in the room. The system makes the screen brighter when you watch it during the day in bright rooms and less bright when you watch it at night to keep your eyes from getting tired. Dark scenes get targeted brightening that shows shadow detail without making the whole picture look washed out.</p>
<p>The full range of connections, such as HDMI 2.1 ports, USB inputs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, works with modern gaming consoles, streaming devices, sound systems, and wireless accessories without the need for adapter dongles or connection issues.</p>
<p>If you want the best picture quality Samsung produces, this record-low price makes flagship OLED TVs attainable without waiting years for depreciation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Another Black Friday, a whole new batch of deals for those patient players who were willing to wait for a good deal, and for Final Fantasy fans, or anyone wanting to see what all the fuss is about, that deal seems to be here. On Amazon, you can grab the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy (so far) for just $50.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade is the complete version of the beginning of this trilogy, including the base game and the Intergrade DLC expansion that Square Enix released for it post-launch. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B08XNRM6QN_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">You can grab it on PS5 right now on Amazon for only $20</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B0CGXZQ4CD_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">you can also grab it for PS5 on Amazon right now for only $30</a>. Some quick maths will tell you that for just $50, you can get the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, save for the third and final game in the trilogy, which Square Enix is still working on.</p>



<p>Development of which, according to Square Enix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">is coming along quite well</a>. It might still be a while until we find out more about the game, but it's good to hear positive updates from Square Enix on the game's progress.</p>

			<p>Today is Thanksgiving for the United States, which is really only significant for Americans. For the rest of the world, though, it means that tomorrow is Black Friday, and along with that come scores of deals available globally that players outside of the US care about as well, like the fact that you can now grab one of the hottest shooters of 2025, Battlefield 6, for just $35.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025" rel="sponsored noopener">IGN</a>, this is arguably one of the best Black Friday deals available for recent 2025 releases, especially when you consider that Battlefield 6 only launched on October 10, and a little more than a month later, it is available for half off. It was available at Amazon, but it very quickly sold out. You can still grab it at GameStop, however.</p>



<p>Here's both links to grab it for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/battlefield-6---playstation-5/428792.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 PS5 - GameStop</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/battlefield-6---xbox-series-x/428791.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 Xbox Series X/S - GameStop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is one deal you'll want to try and grab as quickly as possible, because it'll likely sell out or be removed before the weekend is up. It's an especially good deal if you've already been playing Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/">through the free trial currently ongoing this week</a>, because now you'll be able to continue the progress you've made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2 Runs at 30FPS with NVIDIA DLSS and Baked GI]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Around a month ago, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows, the latest mainline entry in the publisher's biggest open world franchise, would release on Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. The game's engine, the latest version of Anvil, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured many big improvements</a>, ushering the franchise into the next generation with technologies like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive ray tracing effects (global illumination and reflections)</li>



<li>Dynamic wind and rain driven by fluid simulation that affect trees, foliage, leaves, and even rainfall direction</li>



<li>Physics‑based, procedural cloud and weather simulation that continually evolves cloudscapes</li>



<li>Nanite‑style micropolygon system that virtualizes geometry, letting the engine render extremely detailed terrain and assets while smoothly adjusting triangle density with distance</li>



<li>Expanded destruction physics and improved cloth and material interaction</li>



<li>Overhauled terrain and asset streaming built around the aforementioned virtualized geometry system, keeping dense villages and varied topography loaded without hammering CPU or storage bandwidth</li>



<li>Deeper integration of GPU instancing and mesh shaders to cut CPU submission overhead and render many small objects efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 platform, however, is far less powerful than the platforms on which the game was first released on (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). According to Ubisoft's Project Lead Programmer Bruno, the developers had to fundamentally redesign how the world is rendered and even how the game systems of Assassin's Creed Shadows interact with each other.</p>



<p>Core simulation systems like clouds and cloth are preserved but heavily optimized and sometimes downscaled to lower GPU load, while global illumination uses the baked solution already employed on low-spec PC and Xbox Series S to save RAM rather than relying <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the console's hardware ray tracing support</a> to deliver ray traced GI.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Ubisoft had to extensively tune down every parameter (LOD, draw distances, texture resolution, and object streaming) per scenario, reducing NPC counts only where necessary in dense hubs to uphold performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The developers leveraged the Nintendo Switch 2's support of NVIDIA DLSS to reconstruct a sharp image from a lower resolution base, thus accelerating performance. Ultimately, however, Ubisoft settled on achieving a stable 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes. The difference, then, lies in the visual quality, which is further diminished in handheld mode, whereas docked mode offers improved image quality, increased draw distance, and more refined LOD settings.</p>



<p>The handheld mode does have a few tricks up its sleeve, such as HDR support and a tweaked implementation of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). Bruno explained:</p>



<p><em>The lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 FPS, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. We didn't want to compromise on that aspect, and so we built a dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 FPS, keeping the game as fluid and responsive as possible.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft is leveraging a few platform-specific features for this version of the game, such as touchscreen support for menus, maps, and hideout interactions. There are also plans for future mouse and keyboard compatibility in docked mode.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>On December 2, players won't be able to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-review-unremarkable-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, which is coming at some point in 2026 to the Nintendo Switch 2. On that note, Ubisoft also just <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that it'll be the only major expansion coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, unlike the previous entry, Valhalla, which got three (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-wrath-of-the-druids-of-politics-and-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wrath of the Druids</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-siege-of-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Siege of Paris</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-the-end-of-an-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of Ragnarök</a>).</p>

If you've been patiently waiting for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, your time has nearly come: it slinks onto the console next Tuesday, 2nd December. And ahead of its arrival, Ubisoft has shared a bit of a deep-dive detailing some of the technical jiggery pokery it used to make it work on Nintendo's platform, alongside some of its exclusive features.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launched for other platforms back in March following a number of delays, whisking the series to 16th century feudal Japan for an adventure focused on dual protagonists Yasuke and Fujibayashi Naoe. It was well-received too, with Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips calling it "majestic in scope, impressive in detail" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">his four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the Switch 2 version, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">latest blog post</a> confirms it'll include all updates released for Assassin's Creed Shadows so far, with the exception of its Claws of Awaji expansion, which is due in 2026. The company also notes future Switch 2 updates will align with other platforms, and it'll be working on console-specific improvements too, with talk of optimisation patches plus keyboard and mouse compatibility when docked.

<p>
Wondering what else you can expect on Switch 2? Ubisoft is targeting a "stable 30fps" in both docked and handheld modes, saying it's done a "lot of code-level work... to optimise and adapt the game architecture". This, it adds, has enabled it to "streamline certain technical aspects of the quality, without compromising the player's experience or the richness of the game."
</p><p>
Elsewhere it's foregoing Switch 2's ray-traced global illumination support in favour of baked global illumination "mainly for RAM memory reasons", while level of details, draw distances, texture resolution, and element loading have been "carefully adjusted" in an effort to maintain performance. Switch 2 will also feature fewer NPCs in highly populated areas to "ensure smooth gameplay", although Ubisoft reckons environmental richness "remains largely intact". There's also DLSS support for "smoother" performance.
</p>
<p>
As for handheld mode compromises, there've been "adjustments to image quality, draw distance, and LOD settings" to accomodate GPU limitations. However, variable refresh rates make an appearance, as does HDR.
</p>
<p>
If it's Switch 2-specific features you want, there's touch screen navigation when interacting with maps and menus. Additionally, cross-progression is supported via Ubisoft Connect, meaning it's possible to seamlessly hop between platforms if you've been playing - or were planning on playing - Shadows elsewhere. And as a reminder, Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on Switch 2, next Tuesday, 2nd December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the latest game to grace the cover of <em>Game Informer</em>, and to learn more about this game for the cover story, I traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to play two hours of the game and interview the team behind it, too. With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp;</p><p>So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there's any pressure involved, and more. Here's what I learned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here," Yagi tells me. "I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes." Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn't feel much pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. [...] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.”</p><p>When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it's a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">you can read about that here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep," Ichikawa says. "When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII's story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters [...] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake."&nbsp;</p><p>Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, "Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?" while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>I won't spoil anything here, but if you're familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it's just too essential for the story," Yagi says. "There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it's not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking more broadly, Yagi says the team behind Reimagined "really wanted to make the overall game experience more immersive for our players [and that's why we streamlined the story. It's also why we made some adjustments to the combat."</p><p>Closing out our conversation on the philosophy behind this remake, Ichikawa tells me, "Reimagined" implies everything is new.

            <guid>1366792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The use of generative AI tools in game development has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a major point of controversy within the video game industry. Some figures, notably, many studio heads and executives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/">are all for using generative AI in game development</a>. Others <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">don't think it's necessary at all</a>. While we know Epic Games chief executive officer Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">sits firmly in the former camp</a>, he has also weighed in on another aspect of the issue, the fact that digital stores like Steam require developers to disclose that generative AI tools were used in the making of their game.</p>



<p>Currently, games published to Steam that were made with generative AI tools must disclose their use. ARC Raiders, for example, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">includes such a disclosure at the bottom of its Steam page</a>, though with how forward Embark Studios has been about its use of generative AI, we wouldn't have needed the tag to know generative AI tools were used.</p>



<p>In other cases, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">like the recently announced game Beyond Words from former Timesplitters and GoldenEye developers</a>, if not for the disclosure at the bottom, we'd likely not know generative AI tools had been used. And then there are those who still don't disclose its use, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/">admitting it only after they are caught having used it</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">don't admit it at all, and quietly patch it out</a>.</p>



<p>In response to Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman arguing for the removal of generative AI tags and disclosures on storefronts like Steam <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1988991435358482621">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Tim Sweeney agreed with Workman's post, saying that having generative AI tags on platforms like Steam "<em>makes no sense</em>."</p>



<p>Not because those who care about avoiding games made with generative AI have to keep an eye out for the disclosure, and even if it's not there, keep themselves aware for any signs of it. But because in his mind, there will come a day when every game is made with generative AI tools. </p>



<p>"<em>The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>GenAI being used in "<em>nearly all future production</em>" might be what the future looks like in Tim Sweeney's head, but it's debatable that GenAI tools will catch on to such a degree. When Nexon's chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">claimed that players should already be assuming all games are made with GenAI</a>, multiple developers stood up to point out that they would never use GenAI tools for their creative endeavours.</p>



<p>Whichever side you fall on, GenAI tools in game development, especially in triple-A game development, are undoubtedly here to stay. So there will continue to be games made with these tools, and we could get to a point where the disclosures are removed because enough games are using these tools. However, it would be interesting to see if developers who are against using GenAI would respond by highlighting that they did not use GenAI in making their game. It would seriously put to the test what executives are saying, <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">that consumers "<em>do not care</em>" if something was made with GenAI or not</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-full-liquidation-on-santas-sleigh-set-now-selling-at-zero-profit-to-clear-before-christmas-2000648144</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as <strong>LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory</strong> after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/">At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price</a> that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.</p>
<p>The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over <strong>30,000 units already sold</strong> and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>343-Piece Build That Is Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>The <strong>343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders</strong> and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.</p>



<p>The <strong>Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures</strong> that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The<strong> eight wrapped gifts</strong> that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The <strong>guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories</strong> hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.</p>
<p>The <strong>sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide</strong> which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.</p>



<p>The set works just as well as a <strong>hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver</strong> puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.</p>
<p>LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.</p>

<p>Kirby has proven his absolute dominance in the region once again, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> getting off the start line in style with a sweet 195,594 sales under its belt.

<p>Switch 2 hardware sales have seen an expected boost by the presence of a new exclusive Kirby in town, with the console finding itself comfortably at the top of the hardware chart with an additional 126,953 units to its name. It has also been a strong week for PS5 sales, mind you, with the Digital Edition achieving 23,381, and the Pro even overtaking the Switch Lite and standard models with 11,367.</p>
<p>All this means that combining the console SKUs swings things in Sony's favour this time, with the three PS5 units clocking in at 36,920, while the Switch 1 models combine for 29,370.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> probably won't get a second major DLC expansion on the scale of Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft's associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed. It's a blow to fans who are accustomed to getting a couple of major expansions per Assassin's Creed, and a boon to people who haven't even played Shadows yet, let alone the 10-hour-long Claws of Awaji, and are getting dry heaves from FOMO. It's me, I am people.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently," Lemay-Comtois revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">JorRaptor</a>, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">Ian Games</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years." The developers are trying "to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it."
</p>
<p>Claws Of Awaji aside, the first year of Shadows updating brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-a-self-driving-horse-but-i-implore-you-not-to-use-it">self-driving horses</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-much-needed-parkour-update">posher parkour</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-adds-in-collabs-with-dead-by-daylight-and-balatro-of-all-things">Balatro collaborations</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-brings-in-a-nightmare-difficulty-mode-and-another-weird-collab">nightmare difficulty</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient">a more conveniently made open world</a>, amongst other tweaks to the furnishings. The second year "will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed, but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more," Lemay-Comtois suggested in the interview.
</p>
<p>"I'm not announcing anything at this point," he went on, "but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it." 
</p><p>As IGN note, 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> both had two expansions, while 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla got three, with 2023's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> starting out as yet another Valhalla expansion. Why is Shadows getting stiffed with a measly single expansion? Because it was uncommonly hard to develop, Lemay-Comtois explained, with a major technological overhaul that contributed (along with the "soft" performance of stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>) to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a delayed release</a>.
</p>
<p>"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he said. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. The planning for the post launch was not really as clear as it would have been on [previous AC games] where the technology is more stable and well known."
</p>
<p>Shadows originally had a proper season pass, but Ubisoft canned it alongside the delay announcement, and decided to give away Claws of Awaji for free. "I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," Lemay-Comtois added. "And that situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production."
</p>
<p>It seems possible the decision to stop at one Shadows expansion also reflects wider turmoil at Ubisoft, who are busily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Anyway, the upshot is that you AC diehards now have around 10 hours of playtime back to fritter away on something else. I recommend the similarly shadowy and backstabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a>. Alternatively, you could spend it playing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake that absolutely isn't coming in 2026</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Ergonomic Gaming Chair Just Hit a Black Friday Record Low, Not Even Prime Day Went This Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bag-the-razer-iskur-v2-x-ergonomic-gaming-chair-while-its-going-for-just-250-on-amazon-2000647135</link>
            <guid>1366759</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/">Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.</a></p>
<p>It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Design With Plush Fabric</h2>
<p>The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.</p>



<p>Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.</p>
<p>The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!</p>
<p>This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/"> To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount.</a> It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/</link>
            <guid>1366738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>

<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Interview With Post Launch Director Simon... (AC Shadows DLC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Iijrbz8XBc?start=559&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/treat-yourself-or-a-gamer-in-your-life-with-the-16-inch-alienware-aurora-gaming-laptop-while-its-discounted-2000648026</link>
            <guid>1366729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals’ November 27 patch introduced the 18v18 Annihilation game mode. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is now live, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-roadmap-reveals-date-for-rogue-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> tells us when all the new characters, maps, events, and more are arriving in the game.

<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-18v18-annihilation-is-a-domination-showdown">Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation is a Domination Showdown</h2>



<p>Unveiled through a new trailer, Marvel Rivals 18v18 Annihilation game mode will take place on a new map called Grand Garden, where players will participate in a Domination Showdown. The trailer reveals how chaotic this mode can get, with swarms of heroes piling up on both sides. At the same time, it also provides opportunities for players to take down waves of other players when timing their ultimates correctly. Check out the new trailer below: </p>

They’ve been able to cheat their way into locked rooms as before, but what they now find inside… well, Embark called it a “very hot fix” for a reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forward_Problem_7550 discovered</a>, locked rooms now turn you into a fireball if you glitch inside. The clip below shows the trap in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the change is positive, with most players getting a kick out of what Embark has done here. “Best part of this is the clowns doing the glitch lose all their stuff to someone who legitimately opens the door with a key. CLASSIC!” enthused A_Tortured_Crab. “It's genuinely a really good fix,” added vedomedo. “Hopefully this is the mindset they keep going forward. Punish the exploiters and reward legit players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, some players are saying they’re more inclined to use their keys to enter locked rooms legitimately in the hope of finding “some dingus who hasn't read the patch notes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically this isn’t a fix, as players can still use the exploit to enter locked rooms. But it is an eye-catching workaround, and will surely put off players from trying to cheat their way inside a room after they’ve been cooked once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would’ve been better if they just didn’t say anything and rolled this out,” suggested Maverixk_. “Imagine all the door glitches finding this out and losing all of their s**t before word of mouth spread. Would’ve been hilarious.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all the update did. It’s also patched the gun quick swap exploit.

</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's your favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Timesplitters</a> game?</p>
<p>Did you say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Future Perfect</a>? Or even the first one, aptly named "<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a>"? Good, we're gonna get along just fine!</p>
<p>Now, whilst we're not here to announce a new version of Timesplitters 1, 2, or 3 for Switch consoles or anything amazing like <em>that</em>, almost as excitingly, a fan-made re-imagining composed of a campaign mash-up of all three games alongside a huge multiplayer suite of multiplayer challenge maps and modes, has finally — after 13 long years — <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">been released to the public on PC</a>. And it's going down well with anyone in the know.</p>

<p>We've been following the progress of this one for a long while now on and off, and it's absolutely been a real labour of love for its creators, Cinder Interactive, having worked on this project in some form or another since way back when Crytek gave them their full IP blessing off the back of a Timesplitters mod for <strong>Unreal Tournament 2004</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, that transports us back, kids. In fact, you should really check out the <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/about">extensive Project History over at the game's official site</a> to take in the full and fascinating story behind the twists and turns in bringing this new game to life.</p>
<p>So, it's a bit of a surprise, and certainly something worth highlighting, that after a number of setbacks and just how long it's taken, Timesplitters: Rewind has finally released. It's actually real! Furthermore, and if you've checked out the trailer above, we're sure you'll agree, it looks absolutely STONKING. And it's free.</p>
<p>Ah. Timesplitters. Just when we thought we were out (to be fair, we've been out for a couple of decades) you've gone and dragged us right back in. Now, where's our GameCube controllers?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.
