			<p>There are sounds in life you will never forget. The tone of your mother’s voice, the pure joy of your child’s laugh, the opening notes of Oasis’ Wonderwall. These sounds shape, memorialise and fashion your life, but they diminish next to the sheer titanic weight of the songs of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a>. Now with Patapon 1+2 Replay, a whole new generation of gamers can tap their way into a fever dream of rhythm-action warfare.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_dX4l4yPxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beaten on drums by you, the Lord of the Patapon, the songs of the Patapon are capable of commanding legions of one-eyed soldiers, leading and directing them in battle. When, taken alone, the basic sounds of the Pon, Pata, Chaka and Don drums, have no meaning, no reason, but as you stack them up, what you have isn’t just a call to war, it’s an earworm of cacophonous power that will never release you from its grip.</p>


<p>Where you could once picture your child’s laugh, now you just hear the high-pitched chanting of Pata, Pata ,Pata, Pon, the repetition of the musical command putting you in a trance-like state from which there is no return. This isn’t a bad thing, far from it, as Patapon is one of the greatest games of all time, and really, do you need to remember the first few chords of Wonderwall?</p>
<p>Patapon originally released on the PlayStation Portable, at a time when Sony was still happy to indulge its most experimental developers and studios. This is a first-party rhythm-action title that’s played on a 2D plane, has a cast of adorable eyeballs, and uses songs to make those eyeballs attack things. As elevator pitches go, it’s pretty out there, and the reality is even more weird and wonderful. In a truly unexpected move, Bandai Namco is bundling up the first two games together, and bringing them to PS5, Switch and PC under license from Sony, meaning that a whole new set of previously un-Pataponed platforms can discover what makes this series so special.</p>


<p>At least they can, once you’ve got the bad bit out of the way. Patapon 1+2 is a modern collection of two classic rhythm-action games, and the one fundamental to that is being able to press the buttons on your controller in time with the music, while a flashing border around the screen also appears in time with the beat to help you out. The problem is that modern TVs and sound systems all feature varying levels of latency: a delay in either direction between what you’re hearing and what you’re seeing.</p>
<p>These games were designed for the closed, fixed system of the PSP, and the simple act of being on different platforms means that,&nbsp;through no fault of your own, your TV, sound system or console may not match up with the buttons quite in time you press them. In other modern rhythm-action games – Guitar Hero or Rock Band for example – there’s a calibration tool, which tells you the delay between what you’re hearing and what you’re seeing, and tweaks the underpinnings of the game in response. Patapon 1+2 doesn’t have that.</p>
<p>What it does have is a ten-point input timing scale in the main options. This lets you tweak the input timing to try and match your TV, but it offers you no additional help to do this. Instead you’re forced to change the setting, load up one of the games, and then see if what you’ve done is better than what you had before. If it doesn’t work, you have to back out all the way to the front menu, and try again. It’s unbelievably frustrating, and quite possibly the most obvious oversight in recent gaming memory.</p>

<p>This is all exacerbated by playing on Switch, where there’s the further wrinkle of being able to play in both docked and handheld mode, and having different input delay across those two use cases. Handheld play feels perfect out-of-the-box, but only when playing with the Switch 2’s built-in speakers. Trying to use Bluetooth headphones renders the game nigh-on impossible in this mode and I couldn’t find a setting that made it feel comfortable. On Switch, you’re going to have to tinker across two use cases to get your input delay right, while headphones and speakers might change that on the fly. It is, frankly, a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>All that said, if you persevere, Patapon and its first sequel remain two of the most unique, joyful and utterly hypnotic experiences in gaming. The central loop sees you building up your army of eyeballs by acquiring different materials while out on missions, or, in the case of tree branches, playing a mini-game where you have to play along with a tree singing a song.</p>
<p>You make your way through each level by performing musical combos, stringing together the musical inputs for attacking, defending, advancing, and a batch of more specialised commands. If you successfully string ten combos together – or fewer if you’re perfectly on the beat – you enter Fever mode, which ramps everything up, from the song you’re playing along to, through to the Patapon’s high-pitched and chaotic chorus. It also makes your attacks more powerful, enhancing the Patapon’s strength and power, making it nigh-on essential to be in this mode at times, which is easier said than done.</p>

<p>Patapon was always tough, but it feels even more so here thanks to the input latency issues that the PSP never had to worry about. There’s a lot of grinding to be done, and your enjoyment and perseverance will depend very much on how much you’re sold on the music and presentation, as well as whether you can actually play the game. I still adore it, but I can see it being a fairly contentious title for some.</p>
<p>When it gets things right, Patapon 1+2 is an utterly brilliant collection, with a steady stream of songs and moments that will cement themselves in your memory. It’s so simple, and yet excruciatingly tough at times, giving you a real sensation of success while you pick up a host of new materials and weapons to upgrade your army with. As you earn move specific materials, you can create even weirder and more powerful Patapon, until your army looks like a pool of babbling, multi-coloured frogspawn carrying an array of tiny weapons. It is, in a word, iconic.</p>
<p>There are some minor concessions in the name of quality of life, so in addition to the timing adjustments, you do have the ability to display the core commands on screen, and there are now three difficulty settings, but the core challenge of this game does remain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananzas-director-and-producer-have-been-confirmed">Producer Kenta Motokura and director Kazuya Takahashi</a> explained that the game was being built on Switch 1 with the same voxel technology used to create the destructible environments. However, upon learning about the Switch 2, the team shifted development over to the new console to take full advantage of the increased specs.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the added power, however. The team were also keen to see how the new mouse controls could be implemented in the game. As demonstrated in the Direct presentation last month, you can used the mouse controls during multiplayer to initiate Pauline's vocal blasts.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Here's exactly what the team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura</strong>: So this game originally began its development cycle on Nintendo Switch 1 and at the time, we were still using voxel technology and thinking of lots of different ideas for applications. But when we learned about the Switch 2 development, we realized that the best implementation of these ideas and technology would be on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Takahashi</strong>: And when I was previously talking about the importance of the continuity of destruction, that was something that we could expand on and have a longer continuous play experience with that kind of concept on Nintendo Switch 2. So this allowed us to engage in creating really extremely rich variety of materials and very large scale changes in the environment on that new hardware. And when destruction is your core gameplay, one really important moment that we wanted to preserve was when a player looks at a part of the terrain and thinks, can I break this? Because that creates a very important surprise that has a lot of impact for them and that was something that was best done on Switch 2.</p>
<p>But it's not really even just the processing power of the Switch 2 that I think attracted us and gave us some interesting possibilities. There was also the device itself that offered things like mouse control, which you can use in co-op play for a second player to control Pauline's vocal blasts or DK Artist, a mode where you can sculpt a large set of voxels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you remember, it was also confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/mario-kart-world-was-originally-in-development-for-switch-1">started life as a Switch 1 project</a>. As revealed in an Ask the Developer session over at Nintendo, the development team stated that "it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted" in the Switch 1 version, and so shifted the project over to the Switch 2; a move that supposedly provided "a ray of hope".</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is certainly shaping up to be something pretty special, and we can't wait to dive in properly when the game launches on 17th July 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-a-very-long-journey-ahead/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-very-long-journey-ahead.1240341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The RPG genre has never been as popular as it is today. Though very popular in the past, the genre is currently flourishing thanks to major releases like Baldur’s Gate 3, which improved the traditional formula in many ways,  and smaller projects that pay tribute to some of the best games released in the past, like the recent Tainted Grail: Lost Avalon, which, despite its flaws, is a solid tribute to The Elder Scrolls series. </p>



<p>Of Ash and Steel, the first game from Fire &amp; Frost, fits well into this new wave of role-playing games that attempt to capture the spirit of classic games while offering a modernized experience. The influence of the Gothic series and the first two entries in The Witcher series are evident right from the get-go, but I feel there's still a very long journey ahead for Fire &amp; Frost to make the game one worth playing for anyone besides the most die-hard RPG fans willing to look past some critical issues.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of Ash and Steel's first taste is coming with a playtest version I had the chance to try out before its launch on Steam, which offers the chance to play through the game's prologue set in the Grotto where main character Tristan ends up together with the expedition he is part of after some unspecified events taking place at the very start of the adventure and the game's first chapter, set in the Forgotten Reach which provides a better look at what the final game will offer: an open-world RPG where player choice matters and shapes the world.</p>



<p>Right from the onset, it's clear that Fire &amp; Frost's has a solid direction in mind for its game, regarding world design. Even in the prologue, which essentially works as a tutorial, the world feels very lively. NPCs don't feel like props put in place for the player's benefit, but walk around a lot, and interact with one another, talking about a variety of things, including events that may not have any bearing in Tristan's quest, but that still help flesh out the world better. In this regard, things become even better in the Forgotten Reach, also thanks to some rather diverse activities that, while not terribly original, make the experience more varied, leaning into the simulation side of the RPG genre much like mechanics like the light survival mechanics the game currently features.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to enjoy the good that Ash and Steel has to offer in this playtest due to a variety of issues. In a somewhat ironic way, the team seems to have taken the Gothic series' inspiration a little too much to heart, as the game takes the typical jank of the Piranha Bytes titles to the next level, which is not too surprising, given the small size of the development studio. Not counting the subpar visuals, which include bland environments and stiffly animated characters with some bad facial animations to boot, everything surrounding the lively world of Of Ash and Steel leaves something to be desired: movement is extremely floaty, which makes both traversal and the stamina-based combat lightly reminiscent of the Souls series formula with some environment interactions feel very unsatisfying, controller implementation is terrible, as it is essentially slapping mouse and keyboard controls on a controller with one of the worst input schemes seen in recent times, which can be thankfully be changed, an extreme lack of quality-of-life features and a general blandness of the characters and the story.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides being lacking on many different fronts, it's the absence of too many features that have become essential in the genre that hurts the experience the most, such as a feature that highlights objects that can be interacted with. This absence becomes egregious in one of the first few uninspired quests in the game, which tasks Tristan with killing insects by stepping on them. The problem with these insects is that their color blends with that of the ground, making it very difficult to spot them, forcing players to rely on luck to complete the quest. The absence of any quest marker is a great choice to incentivize exploration, but as things stand, it's just a hindrance, because, most of the time, NPCs don't provide good directions to the player. Another of the early quests, uninspired as much as the one described above, tasks players with recovering some tools that have been "thrown up high" by one NPC on a rock, without providing any more detail. This also led to a short "platforming" segment, which was dreadful to play with the game's current movement floatiness and terrible controls. In addition, NPCs do not repeat key dialogue, forcing players to rely on the Journal to review the vague clues they have provided, which doesn't provide anything beyond the vague directions already provided by the characters.</p>



<p>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable exp</p>



<p>Of Ash and Steel is in development for PC. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">Subnautica 2 was going to be delayed into 2026</a>, and that Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, had made the decision because it believed it wasn't ready for an early access launch. </p>



<p>But to Unknown Worlds developers, the timing of the delay felt too convenient, as many of them, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">studio's founders who were fired by Krafton at the beginning of the month</a>, felt the delay was unnecessary, and that the game was ready to launch in early access before the end of 2025. There was also the fact that, based on Unknown Worlds contract with Krafton dating back to when Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">acquired the studio in 2021</a>, if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by 2025, the studio was owed a $250 million bonus.</p>



<p>To members of the Unknown Worlds development team, it seemed more like Krafton delayed the highly anticipated sequel to Subnautica, a game that sold more than 6 million copies since launch, in order to avoid paying Unknown Worlds the $250 million it would be owed. It's still possible for Unknown Worlds to hit the revenue targets that would earn the studio its bonus, but per Bloomberg's report, developers feel that reaching the revenue targets that would unlock the bonus is now "<em>unattainable</em>."</p>



<p>Hours after Bloomberg's report, <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">Unknown Worlds published a statement</a> confirming that Subnautica 2 was in fact delayed into 2026. According to the statement, the decision to delay the game came from the feedback Unknown Worlds received from an internal playtest it recently conducted. </p>



<p>"<em>We got some great feedback about Subnautica 2 during those playtests," </em>the statement reads. "<em>The community was responding well to the environment, creatures, and story, and felt positive about the general direction of the game. It gave us a great indication that we're swimming in the right direction.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It also provided some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of Subnautica 2 to the world. Our community is at the heart of how we develop, so we want to give ourselves a little extra time to respond to more of that feedback before releasing the game into early access. With that in mind, we've made the decision to delay Subnautica 2's early access release to 2026</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also debuted a new gameplay trailer, as part of showcasing the team's confidence in what they've been building with Subnautica 2.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Subnautica 2 - &quot;Take a Deep Breath&quot; (Gameplay Reveal Teaser)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Krafton, for its part, gave a statement to Bloomberg, claiming that the decision to delay Subnautica 2 "<em>was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations</em>." The publisher also maintained that talks about delaying Subnautica 2 took place prior to the founders of Unknown Worlds being removed from the studio. </p>



<p>Per Bloomberg's report, however, delaying the game was not what founders Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill wanted. Cleveland also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">publicly stated</a> that the game was ready for an early access launch.</p>



<p>And while the public statement from Unknown Worlds claims that the delay was to improve areas of the game based on feedback from playtesters, in an internal meeting, Steve Papoutsis, the former head of Striking Distance Studios who Krafton placed as the new studio head of Unknown Worlds following Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill's firing, told the Unknown Worlds team that Krafton felt Subnautica 2 needed more content before it could launch into early access. </p>



<p>Early access games are launched with the understanding that more content is going to be added, and that elements of the game will be fixed and improved based on community feedback. We'll likely never know the exact truth behind the decision to delay Subnautica 2, but it's difficult to believe that Krafton potentially having to give Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus played no role in the publisher's decision to delay the game, especially if it would have ensured that Unknown Worlds hit the agreed revenue targets it was meant to achieve between 2021 and 2025.</p>



<p>Subnautica 2 could very well need more content, but so does practically every game when it launches into early access. Krafton saying that the game needed more content feels like a weak reason, to say the least, made even weaker by the direct claims from Unknown Worlds founders, who also made up the core of the development team for the first Subnautica, saying that Subnautica 2 was ready to take the next step and be built alongside the community through early access.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</a> has attracted a fair few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> comparisons for its sci-fi squad combat and romanceable companions since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rogue-trader-devs-owlcat-are-making-an-expanse-rpg-with-mass-effect-style-combat">announcement last month</a>. Not least from developers Owlcat themselves, who've namechecked the "iconic" RPGs as inspirations. In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons">recent interview with Polygon</a>, creative director Alexander Mishulin said he's humbled, but that Osiris Reborn also has its own approach to choice, consequence, and storytelling  that's a bit different from Bioware's sci-fi trilogy and also the other one (Andromeda was actually pretty solid though).</p>

<p>"Some [people] get into the industry of making games because they saw [Mass Effect] and were inspired. So it would be impossible to deny that Mass Effect had a lot of impact on us as game developers," Mishulin told Polygon. “On the other hand, it’s an Owlcat Games game and it’s different in many ways. We make our story a little bit differently. We’re making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency.”</p>
<p>Which I choose to interpret as him very diplomatically calling Mass Effect's morality system a bit naff, at least in comparison to the CRPG lineage Owlcat are used to working with in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warty Thou: Rogue Trader</a>. Which, fair, but also choices like "do the horrible Genophage and annoy your best Krogan mates or don't do that" felt monumental at the time. </p>
<p>"If you happen to be playing a character of Mars origin or Earth origin — and you will be able to select your origin from the start — you will not be very welcomed on Ceres because of those events," Mishulin offers as an example of how your character's background will set the stage for future encounters. But if you're playing as a Belter in the same situation, there'll more "opportunities, more places to visit, probably some new side quests and everything".</p>
<p>Owlcat aren't "modernising" Mass Effect, Mishulin goes on to say, "just making a game in the same genre but with all the modern trappings."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/owlcat-welcome-mass-effect-comparisons-with-their-expanse-rpg-but-say-theyre-approaching-choice-and-consequence-differently]]></content:encoded>

Players go claim their daily Infinite Nonary Engram like they normally would. Then they delete one of the characters on their account. Then they go back and claim another Engram. It really is that easy. To keep repeating the trick you just have to keep making new characters and deleting them, something especially easy for those who normally only run one or two and have that third slot open. </p><p>In response, Bungie disabled the free daily Engram for everyone. Since it was only the second day since the bonus had gone live, most players had barely even participated. Some logged on for the first time on Wednesday and couldn’t claim anything. To find out what was going on, they had to see the message the <em>Destiny 2</em> team posted around 5:00 p.m. on social media.</p><p>“Due to an issue, we have disabled the daily bonus Nonary Engram available at the Emissary,” the team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1943053691226845318&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1943053691226845318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “We are currently investigating a fix.  Players may still earn up to 20 Nonary Engrams to purchase for Nonary Manifolds through July 15, 2025.” Even those who weren’t familiar with the glitch knew exactly what was going on. “Due to an issue, we have disabled...” has become such a common occurrence in the game that most players barely even flinch. </p><p>“Hah, I was mostly only logging in this week for those engrams, and now they’re disabled. Perfect,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1lvuhwk/d2team_due_to_an_issue_we_have_disabled_the_daily/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1lvuhwk/d2team_due_to_an_issue_we_have_disabled_the_daily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the subreddit. “Yup, that killed my drive for ‘Lootapalooza.’Looks like tonight I finally check out that <em>Mecha Break </em>game!” wrote another. The episode is minor in the scheme of things, but reinforces the idea that Bungie prioritizes being stingy with loot over letting players just have fun. This week is <em>Destiny 2</em>'s “lootapalooza,” after all, just not for the stuff Bungie can actually make money off of. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-infinite-nonary-engrams-daily-login-free-1851786003]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Koei Tecmo has announced and released a demo for its monster hunting game Wild Hearts S on Switch 2, ahead of the game’s release on July 25th. The Wild Hearts S demo consists of the first area of the game, called Haragasumi Way, and it can be played either solo or in multiplayer for up to four players to hunt together. You can grab the demo by heading to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/WILD-HEARTS-S-2848001.html#">WILD HEARTS S page&nbsp;</a>on Nintendo’s site, or on the Switch 2 store.</p>
<p><iframe title="WILD HEARTS S: Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGflRQNZk-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the Wild Hearts S demo, players can wander around all of Haragusumi Way, experiment with the different karakuri tools that get unlocked, and find the tsumoko robots that can assist in battle. There are also different weapons to forge and upgrade while in the area, so you can figure out what the best weapon style is for you from wielding the starter katana to other things like a giant hammer, and a deadly umbrella. If you are planning to get the full release of Wild Hearts S it is definitely worth jumping into the demo as all progress will carry over to the main game.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/wild-hearts-review-ps5-pc-xbox-series-x/">Wild Hearts Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Wild Hearts review, Dom said, <em>“Wild Hearts has proved to be an immense surprise. It navigates the line between well-worn ground and exciting new innovation immensely well. It’s the best non-Capcom hunting game we’ve ever had, and a hugely enjoyable action RPG in its own right.”</em></p>

<p>We knew that the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> has been busy working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but it's now been confirmed that Kazuya Takahashi is serving as the game's director, while Kenta Motokura is the game's producer.</p>
<p>Motokura previously directed Super Mario Odyssey and worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>, while Takahashi only joined Nintendo back in 2020, bringing with him some key experience in open-world game design.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8xurwio&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Of course, the key question in our minds now is what this might potentially mean for the next 3D Mario title. With Motokura on producing duties for Bananza, does this mean he's also been busy creating a new Mario title? It's almost guaranteed at this point that <em>something</em> is in the works, but when and how it shows up is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is scheduled to launch exclusively on the Switch 2 on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k26-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k26-announced-for-september-switch-2-version-also-coming.1240287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced that&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, the latest installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>series of basketball sim games, will be launching in September, and that the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well.</p>

<p>Judging by the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250709742024/en/NBA-2K26-Unveils-2025-MVP-and-Finals-MVP-Shai-Gilgeous-Alexander-WNBA-All-Star-Angel-Reese-and-Hall-of-Famer-Carmelo-Anthony-as-Cover-Athletes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> in which the game was revealed, the Switch 2 version will boast the same features as the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, so for the first time in many years, Nintendo's platform won't be getting the last-gen edition.</p>

<p>Those features include an updated ProPLAY system, which 2K says will allow you to "experience the immersive technology like never before", as well as the City hub, the WNBA-focused The W game mode, and the MyNBA mode, in which you can lead your own franchise to legendary status.</p>

Finally, the Superstar Edition's cover star is Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, 2K says you can look forward to "a reimagined MyCAREER journey" in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em>, in addition to "a fresh and more optimized City" in the current-gen versions of the game. This iteration's MyNBA mode will feature "30 unique storylines", as 2K tells it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you know what to expect from&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>if you're a fan of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date" rel="nofollow">the series</a>:&nbsp;a slick basketball sim with plenty of improvements and new features, plus the usual egregious microtransactions, I'd imagine. You can check out the debut trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>NBA 2K26&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 5th. Picking up the Superstar Edition or the Leave No Doubt Edition of the game will allow you to check it out a week early, as has become customary among new releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The creation of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> started with destruction.</p></div><p>“What we were really going for was this gameplay experience that comes from destruction,” <em>Bananza</em> director Kazuya Takahashi says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. From that simple premise, <em>Bananza</em>’s creators have built an entire game about breaking stuff. </p><p><em>Bananza</em> is the second major Switch 2 exclusive from Nintendo, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">made by the same developers that worked on <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, one of the games that came out during the launch window of the original Switch. According to the developers on<em> Bananza</em>, Donkey Kong’s appetite for destruction didn’t start with his beloved bananas, as one might expect, but with cheese. </p><p>“We had used voxel technology in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,” says <em>Bananza</em> producer Kenta Motokura. “For example, in the luncheon kingdom, you can dig through large piles of cheese, and in the snow kingdom, can plow your way through snow.”</p><p>Voxels, simply put, are the chunks that make up a digital world. The same way a pixel represents the smallest unit of a flat digital image, a voxel is like the smallest unit of a 3D object, and a technology Nintendo was working with way back in the days of the original Switch. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671611/mario-kart-world-9-nintendo-explanation">much like <em>Mario Kart World</em> before it</a>, <em>Bananza</em> was originally planned to be an OG Switch title.</p><p>“We had in mind all of these possibilities using voxel technology,” says Motokura. “But we realized when we learned about Switch 2 that there were even greater possibilities to explore.”</p><p>Those greater possibilities were twofold: variety in the kinds of materials DK could smash and the ability to make that destruction persist. “With the Switch 2, we found that we could create lots of different kinds of destructible objects,” says Takahashi. “This created a very diverse experience of destruction within the game.”</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, there’s very little DK can’t break, smashing through layers of rocks, mud, snow, thorns, and molten chocolate masquerading as lava. They fracture in different ways and make different sounds when hit. And rather than having a destroyed chunk of material reappear after some time, as some games with destructible environments do, the damage you do sticks.</p><p>“What’s really important to that experience is that this destruction is continuous,” Takahashi continues. “That you can destroy something and find something interesting behind it, and then destroy something behind that, and keep on going with new discoveries.”</p><p>For the developers, another part of the <em>Bananza</em> puzzle was figuring out who Donkey Kong is now. He hasn’t been the kind of character to go explorin’ since his days of digging up bananas in <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, 26 years ago. He’s also rarely alone, accompanied by any number of Kong sidekicks or attached to whatever Mario and friends are doing at the time. He’s not alone in <em>Bananza</em> either, this time palling around with a young Pauline. </p><p>It makes sense that Pauline would accompany him, since in the deep Donkey Kong lore, Pauline was the woman he (or a younger version of Cranky Kong) kidnapped in the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> arcade game. But DK already has a gallery of sidekicks, and Motokura says that the subject of partners came up early in the development process, with Pauline being one of the potentials. </p><p>“Very early on this idea came up that Pauline would be a good choice in this case, but it wasn’t implemented right away,” he says. Pauline’s addition would only come later as the development team worked out the kinds of powers DK would use.</p><p>There are animals Donkey Kong can transform into, with each animal giving him a unique power. His base form, which is simply DK himself, allows him to smash through harder materials, like concrete. The zebra form allows him to run over water and other crumbly materials. There are several animal powers DK can use, and the developers asked the music department to create special songs for each transformation. Pauline is a performer. We got a bit of that during the New Donk City performance in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Once it was established that music would initiate Donkey Kong’s transformations, Pauline became a natural fit as a sidekick. </p><p>“From that idea,” Motokura says, “suddenly it was like, ‘Okay, well, then Pauline should be the one to sing.’” Pauline’s music is just as integral to the game as DK’s destruction. Her singing creates musical notes DK can follow to the next objective and it helps her communicate with the creatures they encounter. It even lets her get in on the destructive fun.</p><p>“We also have in co-op play the opportunity for a second player to control Pauline’s voice blasts that affect enemies and the environment,” Motokura says. “So a lot of unique gameplay ideas really just fell into place in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> once we had placed Pauline as the accompanying character.”</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, your job is to move fast and break things. It’s baked into nearly every aspect of the game, right down to its UI, where selecting an option breaks the corresponding button into little pieces. And though the idea of “just break stuff” seems like it’d be a little one-note to hang a game on, the developers have created a game in which you gotta break it to make it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Seasoned Mario Kart players know to drift often to build up boosts and get some extra speed coming around corners. With charge jumps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> seemed to add yet another technique to get some marginal gains and edge out opponents--but the story isn't that simple.</p><p>Charge jumps, which are essentially drifts done on straightaways instead of corners, come with all the same visual indicators of granting a speed boost as classic drifting, but it turns out that the technique may technically slow you down. Following intensive investigation from the Mario Kart community, fans have seemingly confirmed that normal acceleration on a straight is preferable to charge-jumping.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwKJiP4r-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EmwKJiP4r-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user Karting All Day comprehensively explored the differences in speed between charge-jumping and normal racing in the video embedded above. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-charge-jump-speed-boost-too-slow-1851785905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> also independently confirmed the results across different top-speed builds.</p><p>So what, then, is the point of Nintendo even adding this capability to the game? There are a few reasons why charge-jumping can still be useful. In general, they're a way to gain access to certain things; a quick charge jump can get you up to the requisite height to grab a grind rail, and they can also help start wall rides.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched alongside the Switch 2 last month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">a commercial success</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge Of Fate Might Revitalize My Interest</p>
      </div>
<p>Alongside the expansions, Bungie has also given open access to all players to the Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy Episodes. These Episodes follow the events of The Final Shape, setting up the story for the new expansion as well as tying up a few loose ends left behind. These Episodes are only available until the release of The Edge of Fate, meaning they'll be unavailable after July 15.</p><p>However, all rewards, Titles, Triumphs, and cosmetics earned as part of those Episodes will remain on your account after the open access ends.</p><p>The Final Shape marked the conclusion of a decade-old saga, but The Edge of Fate starts a new story, with new enemies, and a fresh location to explore in the form of the planet Kepler. This time around, we'll be dealing with The Nine--a strange alien lifeforce which no one really understands. There'll be plenty of mysteries and secrets to uncover, and you can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">sequence break</a> the game in order to unravel them all, which Bungie says is intentional.</p><p>There are plenty of new additions coming with The Edge of Fate, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-livestream-all-the-new-exotics-weapons-and-artifact-mods/2900-6699/" data-ref-id="2900-6699">new weapons</a>, a complete overhaul of the gear system, and a new location to explore with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-kepler-destination-has-a-limited-time-activity-thatll-give-you-new-exotics/1100-6532892/" data-ref-id="1100-6532892">time-limited activity </a>never seen before. Alongside this, all players will have their power level reset to 200, meaning you'll no longer be horribly overleveled compared to your newcomer friends. That does come with the caveat that you might have to work a little harder to be ready for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid </a>race. If you're waiting for the perfect moment to force your unwilling friends into the sprawling space shooter, it might just be right now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-new-gameplay-trailer-revealed.1240257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that upcoming underwater survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but we've got a new gameplay trailer to keep us going in the meantime.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1962700/view/528724684296950298" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, Krafton and developer Unknown Worlds (which Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>) say that while early player feedback convinced the studios they were "swimming in the right direction", more development time is needed to "improve" in "a few areas", as well as to provide "a little bit more content" for the Early Access release.</p>

<p>This new content will, according to Krafton, include "more biomes, more vehicle upgrades, additional tools", and an expanded story, as well as "more creatures to discover". Given the breadth of the biological phenomena in the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, I'd call that a good reason for a delay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=98lLW2Ye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-delayed-2026-lava.jpg?itok=mWXu_PLk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release has been delayed.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release won't be happening in 2025 anymore, Krafton says it doesn't intend to change anything about the game's creative direction or the team working on it, although that presumably doesn't include the former leaders of Unknown Worlds, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-loses-leadership-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">left the studio</a> earlier this month. No reason was provided for their departure.</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton says you can look forward to a new&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>devlog that will provide more information about the game soon, although it'll be coming out "a little later than intended".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, it's the upcoming sequel to the 2018 survival game&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>, which has already had one standalone followup in the form of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/subnautica-below-zero" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Below Zero</em></a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the original game,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-op play, although it will also feature a solo play option. The game will tell a new story set on a brand new planet full of strange aquatic life to discover (and run away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game).</p>




<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> via Early Access in 2026. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Huge warehouses, bases, and ruins so stuffed with cover and walkways as to suggest the dominant species on the game's pre-alien invasion earth were sandbag piles. These sprawling layouts aren't just for show or getting a nice height advantage, either. The city is explorable between battles with your gang of resistance members, letting you poke around and scavenge before sneaking into optimal positions for the next scrap against invading aliens.</p>

<p>My own personal reaction to realising I'm trapped in a time loop would be the Bill Murray approach, i.e <a href="https://youtu.be/dTbGzGQCe-o">inserting large slices of cake</a> into my mouth, to the audible disgust of Andie MacDowell. Here, you'll be using it to your advantage by learning the location of useful discoveries for subsequent runs. These roguelite bits also make themselves known through a sort of push-your-luck heat meter, where subsequent fights get tougher and enemies more numerous, but also offer better rewards.</p>
<p>The executive producer on the game is YouTube tactics man ChristopherOdd, who I credit for making me markedly less rubbish at XCOM many years ago by offering the simple but transformative advice to prioritise finishing off aliens over everything else - the thinking being that one stray shot from one lowly sectoid can feasibly still kill your best guy. Good advice! Here's him narrating <a href="https://youtu.be/UGywygR2oLA">the game's feature overview trailer</a>. I should also point out how much I appreciate this kind of calm, epic strings-free explanation of what a game actually is. Good trailer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The arrival of the Rifters brought the world to a standstill, but life goes on for your fighters. Uncover their checkered pasts as they learn to work together. Unveil the mystery of the alien invaders and their control over time as you fight through the streets of a once-beautiful city to reveal the full truth about the war. Your resistance grows stronger with each success, and with each failure – after all, death is only the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every Day We Fight should be on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546080/Every_Day_We_Fight/">Steam in early access</a> by the time you read this, unless you've somehow snuck in the RPS content management system, in which case: get out! The lingering scent of bumeggs and Peter Monyleux squirming is ours to enjoy alone.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-publishers-time-loop-tactics-rpg-every-day-we-fight-is-out-today-in-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will discontinue its Switch Game Vouchers scheme, which currently allows Nintendo Switch Online subscribers to buy Switch 1 games at a discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Detailing its plans in a lengthy <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> published today, the company said Switch Game Vouchers would be ditched as of January 30, 2026 — meaning fans still have six months should they still wish to buy more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason has been given for the scheme's ending, though it follows Nintendo's decision not to allow vouchers to be redeemed for Switch 2 software, and after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well">the launch of Nintendo's first-ever $80 game</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers were first introduced in 2019, and offer a flat purchase price for two Nintendo Switch games bought within a 12-month period. In the UK, this price is set at £84, meaning you pay an average of £42 for a game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This typically represents an £8 saving per game from the standard £50 Switch game RRP — and an even greater saving on the select games that Nintendo prices at £60: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Nintendo has not extended the scheme to Switch 2 games, fans have realised they can still use vouchers to buy the original, Switch 1 versions of games with paid Switch 2 upgrades, such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild, offering a cheaper method of obtaining those too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Switch 2 owners can currently buy a pair of Switch Game Vouchers and redeem them to play cross-generational games such as Metroid Prime: Beyond, or the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is due for launch in October. Z-A is priced at the usual £50 for Switch 1, or £60 for its Switch 2 Edition. Buy it using a Game Voucher,  and you can still get the £8 saving for Z-A's Switch 1 edition, before simply paying the £10 upgrade fee to access the Switch 2 Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, Switch Game Vouchers must be redeemed within 12 months after purchase, though Nintendo has said that additional Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-game-development-risks-increasing-due-to-higher-game-prices-and-rising-production-costs-suggests-shorter-development-periods-as-one-solution">the company was now exploring shorter game development cycles for some projects</a> to help keep its costs down, and avoid pricing games too highly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Owlcat Games' The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a space-set third-person action-RPG based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sci-fi-fans-can-save-big-on-the-expanse-complete-series-on-blu-ray-at-amazon/1100-6520164/" data-ref-id="1100-6520164">The Expanse TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-james-sa-corey-captives-war-trilogy-amazon-prime-deal/1100-6525559/" data-ref-id="1100-6525559">the novels by James S. A. Corey</a> (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). When the trailer debuted earlier this summer, the comparisons to Mass Effect were almost immediate. Alexander Mishulin--the game's creative director--recently acknowledged that Mass Effect influenced the development of Osiris Reborn. But the team plans to go in its own direction rather than simply copying Mass Effects' approach.</p><p>"It's different [from Mass Effect] in many ways," Mishulin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "First of all, we make our story a little bit differently. We're making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency."</p><p>As an example, Mishulin noted that players won't be locked into character paths like paragon or renegade. The player can decide whether their characters come from Earth, Mars, or the Belt. That choice will affect how NPC and companion characters react and relate to them during the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQifuOTTe8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's story is set during the first two and a half seasons of The Expanse, and the player's character will be the captain of the most advanced ship in the galaxy. Regardless of the player's choices, the captain is also a twin, and both siblings are on board the ship. However, the twins may not always see eye-to-eye about the best course of action.</p><p>While there will be multiple romance options on the ship, Mishulin noted that Osiris Reborn will feature "a lot more convenient user interfaces [and] convenient approaches to the gameplay," rather than trying to replicate Mass Effects' gameplay.</p><p>Owlcat Games hasn't set a date for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn yet, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The studio is also currently developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Last month, it was widely reported that a stapler ruined the Nintendo Switch 2 launch for some unlucky players who ordered a unit by a GameStop New York store. Now, you can own this involuntary piece of memorabilia and help a charity in the process.</p>



<p>On X, GameStop has confirmed that the infamous stapler used by an employee to staple a receipt directly to a customer's Nintendo Switch 2 box, puncturing both the box and the screen, has been put up for auction on eBay. The stapler comes with a certificate of authenticity and the first unit that has been damaged by it, complete with damaged packaging, although GameStop assured the system has been repaired and is in full working conditions. The stapler and the repaired system are currently going for almost $109,000, but the price is likely going to get higher by the time the auction ends next week. All proceeds will be going to the <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/#:~:text=Children's%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals%20raises,most%20urgent%20needs%20are%20met.">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals charity.</a></p>

<p>Though the Nintendo Switch 2 launch was marred by this incident for some unlucky players, the release of the next-generation Nintendo console was a smashing success, which is throughly deserved, as the new console is a considerable step up from its predecessor in every possible way.

<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83f52c8599a65/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's now well over a month since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch#conclusion-should-you-get-a-switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s June launch, and it seems the majority of owners are happy with their new console. Gripes about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">the screen</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-we-put-the-switch-2s-battery-through-its-paces-with-a-full-timelapse">battery life</a>, and how quickly the internal memory fills up are all valid, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">the general consensus</a> indicates that the joys outweigh the cons; it's a neat system and we're having a brilliant time with it.</p>
<p>Slow download speeds is another area that has been frustrating some people, although it appears to be far from a universal problem. Asking around the Nintendo Life team, our Switch 2 internet speeds across the board either equal our old Switches or they're faster, significantly faster in some cases. But some Switch 2 users online — and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/nintendo-switch-2/switch_2_game_download_speeds_via_wifi_are_slower_than_switch_1_in_spite_of_the_newer_faster_hardware">on our forums</a> — have been encountering connection issues, with eShop downloads sometimes taking multiple hours.</p>
<p>Now, one of the many problems with diagnosing and solving download issues is the number of variables involved. I could quote you my WiFi down/upload speeds standing across the room from my router (81.5 Mbps down, 46.6 Mbps up - you can run a test yourself via your Switch 2's System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Test Connection), but that's not much help when you have a different ISP package with different limits and a router with different capabilities and settings.</p>
<p>Physically connecting your dock to your router via the Ethernet port is an obvious thing to try. Looking around online, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbivpQlpc4Y">people have recommended</a> changing your connection settings by upping the MTU value from the default 1400 to 1500 (which increases the packet size and potentially boosts download speeds). Try System Settings&gt;Internet&gt;Internet Settings&gt;[your network]&gt;Change Settings&gt;MTU for that one.</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Download Upload Speeds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82c2c4ac44d69/switch-2-download-upload-speeds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1l6aurs/comment/mzi7hig">Shonryu79</a> suggested disabling 'IPv6 Connection' via the same settings menu, and several people apparently saw their download speeds leap after that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, people have fiddled with manual DNS settings and tried power cycling — which, for the non-technically minded, is the posh term for turning it off and on again — to mixed results. Again, with so many factors potentially influencing your connection speeds, a one-fix-for-all solution isn't likely.</p>
<p>Nintendo has its own <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/troubleshooting-slow-download-and-upload-speeds-on-nintendo-switch-2">Troubleshooting Slow Download Speeds page</a>, which I'll paraphrase thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>'Move closer to the router'</em></li>
<li><em>'Move other metal and electronic things away from your console'</em></li>
<li><em>'Connect to a different wireless band'</em></li>
<li><em>'Turn your router off and on again'</em></li>
<li><em>'Update your router's firmware'</em></li>
<li><em>'Still nothing? Contact your Internet Service Provider'</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm. The first four are definitely worth a shot, but Nintendo doesn't offer any Switch 2 settings tweaks to potentially solve the problem. And, personally, I'd rather eat my own foot than initiate any contact whatsoever with my ISP.</p>
<p>Have you had any download speed issues with Switch 2? We're keen to get an idea of how widespread the issue is and try to narrow down whether there is an issue with the console itself that Nintendo could potentially address, or if it's the many and various other internet factors causing upset. Let us know in the poll below, and feel free to share with the community any solutions you've found to Switch 2 connection woes.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 is likely to be remembered for a very long time as a great technical achievement, given what the console manages to achieve using so little power in both docked and handheld modes compared to other versions of the game.</p>



<p>In a new video comparing the Nintendo Switch 2 version and the PC version running on Steam Deck, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> also provided an in-depth look at how the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version compare to the different options available on PC. The comparison is favorable for the new generation Nintendo system, as many settings, like crowd density and volumetric fog, are closer to the medium settings, rather than the expected low settings, while others are closer to the high settings, like ambient occlusion and mirror quality in docked mode. Other settings are difficult to match on the PC version of the game due to the ample customization made for the Switch 2 version, but even then, there are many instances where the port impresses, such as with screen space reflections, which are close to the high PC setting in some scenarios, and distant shadow resolution, which are similarly closer to the high settings on PC in several istances.</p>



<p>Even comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 settings to those of the PlayStation 5 version, the port looks impressive, as some options are set higher on the Nintendo system, although that is easily explained by the fact that the Switch 2 version renders at a much lower resolution. In terms of what's been actually rendered, the Switch 2 version, on the other hand, is in the same ballpark as the PS5 version, and superior to the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, which was expected given the much better CPU and storage of the new Nintendo system.  The comparison between the two systems, much like the comparison with the PC settings, is quite favorable to the Nintendo system, as it shows how CDPR did not have to deal with extreme cutbacks for the new version of their open-world RPG.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review-kick-push-kick-push-glide.1240191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember walking around a yard sale I got dragged to as a nine-year-old and spotting a copy of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> for the original PlayStation. Begging my parents to buy it for me, I spent countless hours skating around Foundry and Suburbia (not even sure I ever made it to Canada). With the release of <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em>, I was so excited to hop back into mostly familiar levels, listen to some incredible music, and rack up a high score.</p>

<p>Starting off with the Career Mode, this is everything you should expect returning to <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</em> and 4. Each game is its own separate career track so you can start at the beginning of <em>THPS 3</em> in the Foundry, or in <em>THPS 4</em>'s College.</p>

<h2>Relive the Classics</h2>

<p>You'll have two minutes to attempt to complete a variety of goals; the more goals you complete, the more levels you'll unlock. There isn't really some big "end goal" or celebration at the end, it's a Career Mode but not a Story Mode.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=oJ8WYL33 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-goals.jpg?itok=ugGvg1Be 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The most basic goals are to simply rack up a high score or a high combo. Past that there's objectives to pick up the letters S-K-A-T-E which are a fun challenge that also normally teaches you an interesting line in each level, and a number of very specific challenges to complete.</p>

<p>In London, you'll be performing wall rides on double-decker buses, College lets you hassle frat kids, and you'll be trying to collect stray rivets in the Shipyard. Each of these challenges will prompt players to explore different kinds of tricks, hunt interesting collectibles, or seek out secret spots based on context clues. It does a great job of teaching the player and prompting exploration.</p>

<p>While most of the collectibles to pick up are floating objects that glow and are extremely easy to spot, there's also a number of collectibles that are a bit more vague, like photobombing tourists in Alcatraz. These are definitely the 'harder to come by' objectives, but you'll likely stumble into a few of them while playing the level normally, then it's just up to you to remember where they are and get them all in a single run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who played <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</em> on the original PlayStation, expect to see some differences in map layouts and even ordering as we have to remember this was a time where there would be wild differences between ports of the same games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aspect of many of the levels in <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> that I loved, and maybe just something I'm appreciating returning to these games as an adult, is there's normally so much more to a level than what you first experience. In London, a variety of buildings can be grinded to the top of revealing hidden half pipes, and there's a reward for exploration on Skater Island that's <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> inspired.</p>

<p>There are a few new additions to the game for those who have already explored the originals from top to bottom. Of course, the most basic change is that the game handles fantastically; secondly, there is the addition of two new levels. Pinball, a track that begins with you getting boosted out into a downhill style track, and Waterpark, set in a derelict and shut-down waterpark.</p>

<p>Once you've completed the game, you'll also unlock new, more difficult goals for each level. Just when you think you've mastered a track, don't be surprised when a COMBO line or new objective has you stumped. This is a great addition for a pseudo post-game, letting those who know the game like the back of their hands be tested in a whole new way.</p>

<p>I loved exploring Waterpark. There are handrails to slide over, the remains of what I can assume was a lazy river creating a halfpipe through the whole track, and each ride has doors that you can skate into at the bottom, allowing you to pop out at the top.</p>

<h2>Free Skate and Level Creator</h2>

<p>If you don't want to set yourself a two-minute time limit, you can also skate around in Free Skate. Here you'll have access to all of the levels you've unlocked from the campaign as well as access to the directory of fan-created levels.</p>

<p>The fan-created levels are something that I'm most looking forward to. Unfortunately, at the time of review, there hasn't been much movement there. In addition to having the full freedom to create levels like those in the main campaign, the Level Creator has new objects like the boost pads found in Pinball, but also the ability to make goals.</p>

<h2>The Soundtrack Is Some of the Same, and a Lot New</h2>

<p>It wouldn't be <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> without a fantastic soundtrack, and while not all of the original tracks are returning, new ones have been added that fit the tone and vibe of the original game fantastically.&nbsp;Skating through each level, two minutes at a time, you're able to really enjoy all of the music without it getting repetitive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=ovBdKT7b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-massive-bail.jpg?itok=T5zE1hS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I enjoyed a lot of the new tracks. They all fit the vibe of the game fantastically, but there's a special bit of nostalgia that hits when one of the classic tracks comes on.</p>

<h2>Visual Upgrades Across the Board</h2>

<p>An extremely satisfying aspect of revisiting these levels ~23 years later is that, comparing the visuals of the original game, even that of the PS2 ports, you can see what the team was going for dialed up to 11 with this remake.</p>

<p>You can see it as soon as you drop into the Foundry. The predominantly grey slabs have been replaced with a factory floor. Flashing lights, workers standing around, and more dynamic scenery (including things to skate on or around). All of these improvements show how much care was put into taking what was already a fun playground and filling it with shiny new toys.</p>

<h2><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is the kind of remaster that you want to see. It looks like a shinier version of all of your best memories playing the original and adds just a bit more for new and old players alike to experience.</p>

<p>Even two minutes at a time, it's a delight to skate around the world, interact with all of the different elements of the world, hunt down secrets, and hopefully score some top scores.</p>

<p>After the incredible success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74d91fb2-42d4-403a-99bf-6dd4d42182c9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12" rel="nofollow"><em>1+2</em></a> and now <em>3+4</em>, all I can hope for is <em>THUG </em>to grace our screens again.</p>
