		<p>The last couple of races have given Formula 1 fans a fresh injection of high octane excitement, with Max Verstappen and Red Bull’s inevitability suddenly in doubt thanks to a resurgent McLaren at the hands of Lando Norris. Throw a healthy step forward for Ferrari, and it this could turn into a very fun season to watch. You know what else is fun? Video games, and Codemasters will be glad of the real sport’s entertainment to drum up interest for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which is shaping up to be another big step forward for their motorsports series.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 First Look at Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKbpm3LQppU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, Codemasters has committed to making some significant changes to the game’s simulation and physics modelling. Coming under the capitalise branding of Dynamic Handling – something shared with last year’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC</a> – there’s a new suspension kinematic system that will more accurately represent how cars move around under the massive aerodynamic loads, modelling of how tyres heat up, improved aerodynamics modelling and more.</p>


<p>It’s difficult to truly quantify how meaningful the all-new suspension model is, but without any tweaking it presents a more challenging drive than F1 23, feeling twitchier and more abrupt than its predecessor. There’s a raft of options though to tailor the handling to your personal preferences, and I was able to dial it in to a point that felt comfortable and responsive.</p>


<p>Alongside the handling, there’s been several updates made to the accuracy of each track, but in particular the development team has focused on fan favourites Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, as well as giving recent additions Losail and Jeddah another pass, adding extra detail to both the track elements, and the wider setting. You can see this in Saudi Arabia with the arrival of the vibrant colours of the track limits and cut-off areas, making it feel closer than ever to the real thing.</p>
<p>That commitment to replicating the real thing extends this year to the inclusion of speech from each driver, so you can hear Daniel Riccardo’s downbeat response to Lance Stroll causing yet another pile-up, or Lando Norris congratulating his team on their work. Codemasters has been able to draw from broadcast archives for these soundbites, but don’t expect hours of additional dialogue.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, be prepared to hear the same lines time and time again, and it’s a bit disappointing not to hear them respond mid-race to events that are playing out. It’s an improvement, but an undercooked one. However, your created player can gain additional speech options via the in-game shop, or more can be unlocked via the in-game VIP pass – a premium battle pass for the game which is included if you buy the more-expensive Champions Edition.</p>
<p>What doesn’t feel realistic is the way the game treats its wider simulation, and F1 24 can certainly spit out some very odd results. We’re not just talking about the occasional car failing or crashing out, but races where a driver can have won, despite suffering significant damage earlier on in the session.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are also some oddities to the more… impactful physics model. While the way rogue wheels behave has always caused some issues, they look particularly weird here. It’s a shame that a high-force crash doesn’t result in a realistic-looking wreck, and while the aim of the game is clearly not to crash, it definitely happens with enough regularity that you’ll witness some very odd physics at play.</p>
<p>The visuals have been given a good scrub-up for 2024, and many of the tracks look better than they ever have. One of my personal favourites, Monaco, just looks that much more eye-catching than it did last year, and that’s gratifying after 12 months with the previous game. Foliage, hoardings and track furniture are fuller, more detailed and just nicer to look at, and at this early stage in our F1 24 career it’s pretty enough to be distracting at times. Luckily, you can still rewind your mistakes.</p>
<p>As part of those visual improvements, the drivers themselves look genuinely phenomenal. If you compare them to the previous year’s versions, the improvements are deeply impressive, with revised skin, hair and facial detail ensuring that it feels as though you’re part of the Formula 1 world.</p>

<p>While the current raft of drivers are stars in their own right – particularly after Drive to Survive has made them household names, even in households that don’t like F1 – one of my favourite additions is the ability to take legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna into the career mode. While F1 23 allowed you to choose a number of iconic racers as your teammate for the season, now you can play through a further career with them, perhaps returning them to the spotlight after many years away from the grid.</p>
<p>F1 24 brings VR support to PC players, but PSVR 2 will miss out once again this year, which is disappointing given that it’s the most accessible route into home VR. I really hope that this is an update that PS5 owners can look forward to, but there’s no word on that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Thus far, PC performance is impressively smooth, with my GeForce 3070-equipped rig sitting right on the Recommended specifications. We were able to run nearly everything at ultra-high graphic settings while maintaining a framerate over 100 FPS, and even in the early review build all of the external options and menus operated exactly as you’d hope. One of the clear improvements is the cinematic view, and replays look and perform more realistically than ever before.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for a new season of Formula 1, F1 24 is already shaping up to be a clear step up from its predecessor, bringing smart changes and improvements to what was already an enveloping driving experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mattel-outright-games-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Matchbox&nbsp;</em>company Mattel has announced a partnership with Outright Games, which is apparently a "leading publisher" of family-friendly games.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Mattel is looking for "top-tier" studios with which to work on video game adaptations of some of its most beloved IPs, and to that end, the toy giant has apparently settled on&nbsp;<em>Bluey: The Videogame&nbsp;</em>developer Outright.</p>

<p>In said press release, Outright's Stephanie Malham says her studio prides itself on expanding major IPs into "cherished video games", which <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15882/bluey-the-videogame" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feels</a> just a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14459/peppa-pig-world-adventures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">touch</a> like an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13427/dc-league-of-super-pets-the-adventures-of-krypto-and-ace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overstatement</a> to me, but hey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=sbv5Jtzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=U0Fa54Jm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Outright Games is best known for "cherished" titles like&nbsp;<em>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Together, Mattel and Outright are working on three major projects based on Mattel IPs, and all three of them are set to launch on PC and consoles before the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Those games are&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures</em>, <i>Monster High: Skulltimate Secrets</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Barbie Project Friendship</em>. No prizes for guessing which Mattel IPs they'll all be based on.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures&nbsp;</em>will offer "high-speed competitive driving adventures", while&nbsp;<em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster High&nbsp;</em>will provide "stories that emphasize teamwork and foster friendship".</p>

<p>Whether or not that means the latter two will be primarily co-op focused remains to be seen, but more information will be available in the coming months. Better get those tenterhooks ready.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=5YWQ9_Pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=YVyXxnz1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mattel is already well-known in the gaming space thanks to games like&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Outright has teamed up with a well-known company whose products are largely intended for kids. All the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outright-games-partners-with-crayola-for-unnamed-upcoming-games">back in 2018</a>, Outright teamed up with Crayola for the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Crayola Scoot</em>, which is presumably <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/6754/crayola-scoot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another one of the publisher's "cherished" titles</a>.</p>

<p>Mattel is also already pretty well-represented in the gaming space thanks to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-into-high-gear">Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-barbie-collab"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Barbie</em>-themed content</a>, although Outright isn't involved with either of these, naturally.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this collaboration yields, but I'm sure the three games outlined by the two companies will be all-time classics. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162373/super-mario-maker-builder-64-rom-hack-nintendo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Maker</em> series</a> of games lets you create your own sidescrolling platformer levels using sprites and 3D objects from several entries in the franchise. It’s created a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24127340/super-mario-maker-nintendo-wii-u-shutdown">deeply devoted fan base</a>, but it’s only ever let you make sidescrolling levels. Now, a pair of fans have changed that with <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a>, a new way to make and play your own <em>Super Mario 64</em> levels — and do so on Nintendo 64 hardware. </p><p>It’s technically a ROM hack, but the term doesn’t really capture what this is. The developers, <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/Arthurtilly">Arthurtilly</a> and <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/rovertronic">rovertronic</a>, describe it as “a toolbox letting you fulfill all of your SM64 dreams.” Just like the <em>Super Mario Maker</em> series, it lets you create your own levels using a special creator interface that borrows a lot from <em>Minecraft, </em>giving you low-res textured (this is the N64 after all) cubes that you can drop in place. </p><p>You can also decide what music you want, place items and villains, and even play with <em>Mario 64 </em>conventions. For instance, there’s no hard limit on how many red coins you can require players to collect to get a star. </p><p>To use it, you have to patch a <em>Mario 64</em> ROM file yourself. The developers have a <a href="https://rentry.co/mb64-setup-guide">guide for doing so</a> (in addition to the video above), and you’ll need an emulator or an actual Nintendo 64 to play the game with the Builder 64 modifications in place. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-super-mario-64-mod-may-be-as-close-as-we-ever-get-to-mario-maker-3d-204024562.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em> points out</a>, you can do that with a flashcart that supports SD cards — several options are listed in the guide linked above.</p><p>I haven’t been able to play around with Mario Builder 64 just yet, but I’m eager to do so as soon as life affords me the time. It looks like a blast, judging by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_UnDcfx1Dn4">this video</a> from the Good Vibes Gaming YouTube channel. As pointed out in that video, you can <a href="https://levelsharesquare.com/levels">download other user-created levels</a> from Level Share Square, a site that hosts levels made for various fan-made <em>Mario</em> level creators.</p><div><p>But how long will Mario Builder 64 last? Only Nintendo knows what its bar is for taking down projects like this, but it has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">put emulator developers on edge</a> with some high-profile takedowns lately. There’s its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">$2.4 million settlement</a> with Switch emulator Yuzu’s developers and subsequent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147936/nintendo-dmca-takedown-yuzu-emulator-copies">obliteration of GitHub-hosted Yuzu forks</a> — and its insistence that the creators of <em>Garry’s Mod</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca">remove two decades of Nintendo-related content</a>. </p></div><p>To be fair, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24085075/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit">Yuzu let people play</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23706907/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-streams-leak-nintendo"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> before it was released</a>, and people used <em>Garry’s Mod</em> to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DC_Oc9mhyuBQ&amp;xcust=___vg__p_23904287__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D">turn <em>Super Mario 64</em></a> into a first-person shooter, which Nintendo probably wasn’t thrilled about. Mario Builder 64 is just doing <em>Super Mario 64 </em>stuff, so maybe it gets a pass, but that probably depends on Nintendo’s plans for the <em>Mario Maker</em> series, which could easily involve something just like Mario Builder 64. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161985/tom-king-archie-comic-decision-bettie-veronica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KUKiZC">Archie’s been putting his tough choices off for too long. It’s finally time for Riverdale’s favorite son to decide between Betty and Veronica, and thankfully he’ll have a special guest writer to help make sure things go smoothly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22824979/best-dc-comics-2021-rorschach-watchmen-tom-king">Legendary comic scribe Tom King</a>, along with artist Dan Parent, will step in for a full-length one-shot called <em>Archie: The Decision</em>, in which Archie finally makes his choice. </p>
<p id="MRp3g0">As you might expect for such a landmark moment in Riverdale’s history, <em>The Decision</em> will feature many of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824779/archie-comics-danni-malloy-trans-representation">Archie Comics’</a> fan-favorite characters, from Josie and the Pussycats to Sabrina the Teenage Witch, all reacting to the decision and sharing their thoughts. </p>
<p id="wsRNjw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king">King</a>’s reputation as a writer of the biggest, thinkiest superhero comics of the last decade tends to overshadow the consistent humor in his books. The writer of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/20/22240734/wandavision-comics-vision-scarlet-witch-marriage-explained"><em>The Vision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/12/29/14093714/rogue-one-comic-omega-men"><em>Omega Men</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king"><em>Mister Miracle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/12/19/21028752/batman-85-tom-king-final-issue-joker-dc-comics"><em>Batman</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22591012/new-supergirl-superman-comics-tom-king-dc"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> seems excited to fully embrace Archie-style comedy. </p>
<p id="7ZAYPA">“As a massive Archie fan, this is just a pure joy project for me,” King told Polygon via email. “I wanted to do something zany and cool and screwball and hysterical and gorgeous and harebrained and maybe a little tiny itty-bitty bit profound as a tribute to my Golden and Silver Age Archie heroes — people like Dan DeCarlo, Harry Lucey, Bob Bolling, Bob Montana, and Samm Schwartz. And who better to do that with than the modern Archie maestro, Dan Parent, who inherited and brilliantly carried on the legacy of those giants. [<em>The Decision</em>] is an epic, riotous story featuring scores of Archie characters where Dan and I wrestle with the greatest dilemma in the near 85-year history of comics: Betty or Veronica!? I’m not sure we can solve it, but, like all of Riverdale, we’re going to have a ton of fun trying.”</p>
<p id="EvCoz6"><em>Archie: The Decision</em> hits shelves on Aug. 28, clocking in at a full 32 all-ages pages. Archie Comics has shared a sneak peek of the issue with Polygon, including a variant cover by Stephen Byrne and one page of the book itself, that you can check out below:</p>

<p>With the success of Helldivers 2, Arrowhead Games Studios has some big new aspirations. In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former CEO, now Chief Creative Officer,</a> Johan Pilestedt said that the studio wants to become the next major studio like Blizzard of FromSoftware. </p>



<p>“We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told the outlet when talking about making the games they want. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody.</p>



<p>“I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard.”</p>



<p>How that looks, exactly, isn’t clear because it’s not something that happens overnight. Even with the fast rise of Helldivers 2, new CEO Shams Jorjani says he knows there is work to be done, but that he doesn’t want the company to lose focus of why they do what they do.</p>



<p>“We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself,” Jorjani said. “We don’t have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>



<p>“We don’t run the business for monetary gain,” Pilestedt said. “The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist.”</p>

<p>Countless players worldwide didn’t upgrade their last-gen systems to the current-gen, most likely due to the rising cost of console hardware. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X remain costly, and the exclusives aren’t up to snuff, so why upgrade? If you’re one of the many playing on an old system, you still don’t want to miss out. So, can you play XDefiant on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-on-xbox-one">Is XDefiant on Xbox One?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, you cannot play XDefiant on Xbox One. Despite being a free-to-play game that one would imagine Ubisoft wants everywhere all at once, the arena shooter is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>That said if you have a PC—not even a top-of-the-line system—you can likely play XDefiant. The overall system requirements, especially the minimum and recommended, are welcoming to most players. To enjoy the free-to-play shooter on PC, download Ubisoft Connect, visit the store page, and add the game to your account. You may then download and install it via your game library and hop into the game!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-xdefiant-free-on-xbox">Can You Play XDefiant Free on Xbox?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play XDefiant on Xbox One, you can play free on Xbox Series X|S. You can play XDefiant free on all its supported systems: PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s a completely free-to-play arena shooter, though it does have microtransactions, that you can download and enjoy without paying a dime.</p>



<p>On Xbox Series X|S, visit the Xbox Store, search for XDefiant, and add the game to your account to start downloading. Once finished, boot up the game and enjoy!</p>



<hr>



<p>XDefiant is taking the gaming world by storm, which is a pleasant surprise. But does it have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Search and Destroy</a>?

Now, according to former Arrowhead CEO and now Arrowhead Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt, bigger success means bigger toxicity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p><p>When Helldivers 2 launched it faced significant server issues that made the game unplayable for many, sparking an initial backlash. But since that issue was largely resolved, Arrowhead has faced complaints about everything from weapon balance to low impact Premium Warbonds. But by far the biggest backlash was sparked by Sony’s controversial decision to force PC gamers to link to a PlayStation Network account to play. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but not before a review-bombing campaign savaged Helldivers 2 on Steam. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-to-revert-patrol-and-spawn-rate-changes-admits-psn-controversy-diverted-studios-attention">Arrowhead community managers have said the PSN backlash caused staff to lose a week simply having to deal with the fallout</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community.</p></div><p>That’s plenty to contend with in just a few months post-launch. But Pilestedt suggested the way Helldivers 2 was designed, with frustration deliberately in place to craft the co-op experience hardcore players fully understand and appreciate, may also fuel toxicity from the wider playerbase. “If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs,” Pilestedt said.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">New Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani</a> added: "Arrowhead’s philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one.' That is the company slogan. It’s how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it’s one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p><p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought – Sony, us, everyone – what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity.</p></div><p>Jorjani said that Arrowhead is currently “learning painfully” how to create systems to deal with this level of toxicity, but the work will benefit the studio’s “next thing, whatever that may be.”</p><p>Arrowhead isn’t the first developer to call out toxicity within video game communities. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-calls-out-growing-tendency-of-toxicity-in-its-community">Cities: Skylines 2 developer Colossal Order asked players to help create a more positive environment after noticing “a growing tendency of toxicity” in its community</a>.</p><p>As for Helldivers 2, Arrowhead is full steam ahead on adding content to its live service, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">it has indicated plans to slow down the frequency of patch releases</a> to make sure it gets them right.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Now, Johan Pilestedt, who was Arrowhead CEO, becomes Chief Creative Officer. In a tweet, Pilestedt said this means he will get to focus more on the studio’s games as well as its community.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Big update, I've decided to hire <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ShamsJorjani</a> as the new CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ArrowheadGS</a>!

In a tweet, Jorjani said he was “humbled and excited to get to work with such talented nerds (again!).” Pilestedt remains Arrowhead chairman amid the reshuffle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1793267715756458049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The shakeup at the top of Arrowhead comes after a particularly difficult time for the developer, which butted heads with Helldivers 2 publisher and IP owner Sony over the PSN account requirement backlash. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but the game remains unavailable in countries where PSN is not live.</p><p>Arrowhead has also indicated it wants to spend more time focusing on things like patches and weapon balance after community complaints around nerfs and low impact Premium Warbonds. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">Arrowhead said it was pumping out balance patches too fast</a>, and wanted to slow the live service down a bit.</p><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793268430734340405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Pilestedt explained his decision to step down as CEO further: “Not nearly done.

                <p>The Philippines-based Polychroma Games is set to release the narrative adventure game Until Then later this year. It follows a young teenager named Mark in the Philippines as he goes through the trials and tribulations of high-school life, such as hitting deadlines and making presentations. However, people from his life start disappearing and his memories become unreliable, meaning it's up to him to check up with his friends to untangle the mystery surrounding his memories. Until Then explores the lives of Filipino students through its gorgeous pixel-art style and how themes like communication and friendship are so integral to Filipino culture.</p><p>Slice-of-life, coming-of-age stories that depict daily school lives are incredibly popular in Asian media, especially in video games. The most prominent example is the Persona series, which is set in Japan. Until Then follows similar footsteps with Mark. "It's the same with the Philippines as well," Polychroma Games senior environmental artist Pia Demanawa tells GameSpot. "This is the part that we romanticize the most, because we feel furthest away from adult responsibilities here, and we can just mess around with our friends."</p><p>Director Mickole Klein Nulud adds that academics and achievements play a big part in many of Asia's youth, saying, "We spend a lot of our time in youth here and, as a result, end up making it a stage for interesting things to happen in stories, both good and bad."</p><p>Until Then also features many nuances of Filipino culture within its themes. Demanawa says that communication is the most important theme in Until Then. In Filipino culture, there's a word, "torpe," which describes a person who doesn't show their feelings towards someone they like. Throughout the game, Mark shows some interest in a few girls, and things sometimes don’t go his way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQQgY2fVTOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PQQgY2fVTOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What exemplifies the concept of torpe more than unrequited teenage love? "Because the characters don't open up with each other, they end up misunderstanding and assuming a lot of things about each other," Demanawa explains. "That threatens and breaks apart the relationships that they have, and in the end, they can only really strengthen their bonds as friends."</p><p>Until Then is presented in a 2.5D pixel-art style, similar to other Southeast Asian-developed games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chinatown-detective-agency-review-carmen-singapore/1900-6417856/" data-ref-id="1900-6417856">Chinatown Detective Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/a-space-for-the-unbound-launch-trailer/2300-6460495/" data-ref-id="2300-6460495">A Space for the Unbound</a>. He says that he enjoyed the pixel-art style and thought that having an eye-catching visual style was important for the game. Nulud also specifically cites the cinematic platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last Night</a> as an inspiration.</p><p>Nulud says that one of the biggest challenges in developing the game was the sheer number of sprites that needed to be managed. There are tens of thousands of PNG files from all character animations combined just to make the faces of the 2D characters' faces expressive.</p><p>"In scenes, we manually change each characters' facial expressions almost line by line in addition to perfecting the timing of delivery and pauses," he says. "I find it a little funny because, as the director, I am literally directing how these characters act as if they were real people."</p><p>Demanawa adds that the character sprites started with the same number of pixels as their backgrounds. However, the pixel density of the sprites was later increased in order to emphasize the characters' mannerisms. They explain, "This would allow us to have more real estate with poses and expressions, which is necessary to really let the characters' unique identities shine through."</p><p>The game also has many inspirations and references from real-life places in the Philippines. In the beginning of the game, Mark rides the train station to school, which is modeled after the real-life Katipunan station and LRT-2, a transit line in Metro Manila. The Quezon Memorial Circle also shows up in-game briefly, and Mark's school--the fictional Liamson Integrated School--is based off of Nulud's real-life alma mater, Rizal National Science High School.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473" data-ratio="0.56225528582616" data-width="1277" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473"></a><figcaption>Until Then</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304474,1300-4304475,1300-4304476,1300-4304477,1300-4304478,1300-4304479" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Nulud says, "If it's not any particular place, we take general inspiration from the houses you'd find in the streets, Filipino architecture, and so on."</p><p>Until Then's development started during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dmanawa says that the team couldn't physically visit places for inspiration, so they had to rely on things like Google Earth and their own memories in order to recreate them. While the locations in Until Then aren't pulled straight from real life, they're the result of amalgamations that the team brainstormed together.</p><p>There were also inspirations from anime and movies as well, and Nulud's taste in film and anime changed throughout the game's four-year development cycle. At the beginning, Until Then's story aspirations were inspired by Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April and Makoto Shinkai's work. However, as development continued, more artful and slower films such as ones by Ryusuke Hamaguchi took a stronger hold on his influences.</p><p>"Now I know we can't just do a 180 and change the story's fundamentals in response to new inspiration," he explains. "We have to strike a certain balance, and indeed, there are times where this side of our influences shows and those are my favorite moments in the game."</p><p>Nulud also notes that human relationships and communication are some of his favorite ideas to tackle, saying, "As for how they're reflected in the game, it's best that players find out for themselves in this beautiful, cathartic journey we crafted."</p><p>Until Then will launch for PS5 and PC later this year--it had been due out on May 23, only to be delayed by a few weeks, with no new date set yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A demo is available on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt has a number of projects in the works, including a new IP in the works under the codename Hadar. Maria Mazur, a quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that it "only makes sense" for the Polish game studio to branch out and make something brand-new. Mazur also debunked a rumor about the new IP.</p><p>"I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/22/hunt-showdowns-new-gen-console-update-arrives-in-august-rendering-last-gen-versions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.</p>

<p>That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game.&nbsp;Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been putting off your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-prepare-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> preparations</a> until now, it’s time to put things into high gear at long last. Notably, Bungie’s just announced that <em>all</em> of the game’s Brave weapons now drop at substantially higher rates, giving you a better shot at farming them.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">For those who aren’t in the know, Brave weapons are the snazzy new kit that’s been added to the game as part of the free <em>Into the Light</em> interim DLC, which has successfully served its role as a lead-up to <em>The Final Shape</em>. Now, with just a few weeks to go before the hotly anticipated DLC launches, Bungie has bumped up the overall drop rates for all the featured Brave weapons <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52ikg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a fair margin</a>, according to the community.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Now, do note that nobody is quite sure <em>how much</em> Bungie has increased the drop rates, with <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l53tc9a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some claiming that it’s only the Brave tokens</a> that are more common. The evidence <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52qo6b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes both ways</a> so far, but one thing’s for sure: it’s worth spending some time in <em>Destiny 2</em> if you want to fill out your inventory with solid gear ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-don-t-let-the-fomo-get-you-but-do-grab-brave-weapons-while-you-still-can" data-injectable="false">Don’t let the FOMO get you, but do grab Brave weapons while you still can</h2> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">This is particularly important because, even though the Brave weapon set itself <em>is</em> sticking around after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-shiny-destiny-2-into-the-light-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the awesome Shiny Brave weapons</a> are <em>not</em> going to be accessible anymore. Likely ever, considering Bungie’s stance on exclusive ‘you had to be there’ cosmetics. And, since the announcement specifically points out that you may also want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brings-back-fan-favorite-superblack-shader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grab the Superblack shader</a> while it’s still around, it’s entirely possible that it, too, will be effectively sunset after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">That’s just how it goes in <em>Destiny</em> land, I suppose. A similar fate is about to befall <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/did-you-know-destiny-2-is-probably-going-to-sunset-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fishing mini-game</a> too, though I’d be hard-pressed to say that it’s even remotely as enticing or important as the Pantheon, Brave gear, and other such goodies.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">If you don’t really care all that much about any of these items, then simply waiting until <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out proper is obviously the way to go. The DLC is due to come out on June 4, and its patch notes are so massive that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-patch-notes-are-so-big-that-bungies-splitting-them-across-three-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s had to split them across three <em>massive</em> preview blogs</a> just to stay on top of them all. That’s pretty exciting, even if you’re a cynic.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">So, all in all, you may as well consider this a last-call sort of thing for a huge list of <em>Destiny 2</em> content. If you have the chance and the inclination to do so, put your farming galoshes on and grind on.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant.878313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you are tired of being killed by the MP7 in <em>XDefiant</em>, it might be time to start using the devastating SMG yourself. Here is the best set of attachments, and Faction to use in tandem with the popular weapon. </p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><em>XDefiant</em> supports several different play styles, depending on how you enjoy approaching a match. For players who enjoy being aggressive, shotguns and SMGs are the two best weapon classes for running and gunning. <em>XDefiant’s</em> meta will still take some time to settle in fully, but the MP7 is the preferred weapon for any gunfight 10 meters away or closer. The MP7 has it’s fair share of shortcomings, but that tradeoff is worth it for one of the best weapons in the title. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-mp7-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best MP7 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em> </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Lightweight </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Pistol </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Quick Draw </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Collapsed </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">The MP7 doesn’t offer much in the way of accuracy, but that’s alright, considering this SMG dominates in mobility, firepower, and reload speed. With this set of attachments equipped, enemies will have a miserable time trying to fight while you slide around and make life difficult for them. I wouldn’t recommend trying to use this loadout for any mid-range gunfights, but it’s perfect for anything within 10 meters. The MP7 is never going to be an accurate weapon, so we leaned in to its strengths and went for attachments that improve mobility even more. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> Faction for the MP7</h2> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="false">There might be better options, but Echelon is the most fun Faction to have while using the MP7. The Low Profile Passive Trait hides you on the mini-map even if you fire your weapon unsuppressed, which is perfect for MP7 flank routes. Additionally, the Digital Ghillie Suit makes you invisible while you attempt to get behind and closer to enemy lines. Players can also choose to equip the Intel Suit instead, if they want to temporarily reveal the location of enemies. And finally, the Sonar Goggles Ultra ability reveals every enemy on the map and gives you a pistol that annihilates the competition. </p>

<p data-characters="395" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With Riven&nbsp;being featured&nbsp;in the last week of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide/">The Pantheon</a>, there’s never been a better time to learn how to defeat that&nbsp;big&nbsp;old wish dragon properly.&nbsp;The truth is, Riven&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;actually&nbsp;all that hard&nbsp;when attempted&nbsp;normally.&nbsp;And with everyone participating in one way or another, the encounter can even prove to be a bit of fun.</p> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Riven is one of the final encounters in the Last Wish Raid and one of the pivotal characters in Season 23,&nbsp;<em>Season of the Wish</em>. While Last Wish is still heralded among the best <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/">Raids&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;offers</a>, Guardians seem allergic to learning the fight, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/116ejn6/anyone_know_the_most_reliable_way_to_kill_riven/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various “cheese” methods have persisted</a>&nbsp;over the actual mechanics. While it’s easy enough to have two Stasis Titans smash Riven to smithereens in a few seconds, it’s much more rewarding to have mastery over the encounter. And who knows, this knowledge might even help in The Pantheon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-setup-and-descent" data-injectable="false">Setup and descent</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="689" data-current-count="989" data-injectable="true">Soon after the encounter starts, Guardians must split up to handle mechanics in two separate rooms. Knowing where you’re going and what you’re doing ahead of time can make all the difference. While it’s not required to prepare by assigning players roles and splitting them into teams, it can help keep the run more coordinated. The Fireteam will ideally want two teams of three, with one pre-assigned runner, one reader, and one player to clear enemies. Players will also want to have a sniper or similar precision weapon available. For boss damage, many strategies can work, but keep in mind to avoid anything that might accidentally pop one of Riven’s eyes early.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Once the composition is decided, the Fireteam can rally and start the encounter by having a player stand on each of the six plates around the room. After the last plate is stepped on, the floor will drop out from below players, and they’ll begin a safe, slow fall to a chamber below housing Riven. The lower chamber has two doors by either end of the walkway. This is where the group splits, with each team heading into a different door.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Riven hide-and-seek</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="735" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true">After a short jog, the next part of the encounter will begin when each team has made it to their rooms. In these rooms, Riven will first appear to one of the two teams and move to attack. Emerging from the wall, Riven will either open its mouth to do breath attacks or ready its tentacles to slam Guardians. If it’s a breath attack, Guardians should take cover and shoot Riven’s open mouth in between breaths. For the tentacles, someone will need to get close to bait one, and then the team can all shoot it after it slams down. After either of these mechanics is complete, two of Riven’s ten eyes will sparkle. These should be assigned callouts (typically L1-L5 and R1-R5) so&nbsp;they can be communicated&nbsp;ASAP.</p>
 <p data-characters="723" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">If Riven didn’t initially appear on your side, you’ll have another mechanic to complete.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is where the team roles come into play. Before long, an enemy called Eye of Riven will spawn into the room and drop a Taken Orb when defeated. The runner should grab the Orb and look toward the entrance to see a symbol repeated along a wall. The reader should position themselves behind the glass wall at the front of the room, as they’ll see symbols all over&nbsp;the room&nbsp;when looking through the glass. After the runner communicates their symbol, the reader must help guide them to where that symbol appears in the room. Once there, the runner can use their grenade to cleanse the&nbsp;symbol.</p>
 <p data-characters="716" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">If both sides are in sync, each should finish around the same time, and&nbsp;then&nbsp;team roles will swap. Riven will appear in the room she wasn’t in initially, and the other team can begin their reading puzzle. When Riven&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to the second group, she’ll immediately go for a new attack, opening her mouth to reveal a Taken Blight. The team must focus the Blight and then shoot the eyes called out by the previous team. Once this process is complete, the lifts in the front of the room will activate, and players can head to the next room. From there, this process repeats&nbsp;again, with players having called out six of Riven’s ten eyes by the time they head up the lifts again.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Regroup and damage</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="875" data-injectable="true">After taking the lifts for the second time, players will emerge in the large chamber where the Rally banner was, and the whole Fireteam&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;meet up. Riven will periodically poke her face out to attack the team with either her tentacles or a breath attack, followed by more eye shine. The boss will do this three times, giving three new callouts for eyes, before opening her mouth to reveal another Taken Blight. Once this Blight&nbsp;is destroyed, Riven’s eyes will be available, and all six new callouts must&nbsp;be destroyed&nbsp;quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">If successful,&nbsp;players can run back to their plates and drop down again.&nbsp;This time, Guardians&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;target the bulging growths on Riven’s body, dealing massive damage to the boss.&nbsp;If&nbsp;this is enough to push the boss, the fight will move on.&nbsp;Otherwise, players will go through the above steps again. Once&nbsp;pushed, players will be teleported into the Ascendant Plane and must navigate upwards towards a portal out. When Guardians make it out, Riven will make one last push, opening her mouth and revealing another Taken Blight. The Fireteam can unload everything they’ve got, stunning Riven and making her collapse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="false">It may look like the battle&nbsp;is won, but there’s&nbsp;actually&nbsp;one more step to defeat Riven: charge into the dragon’s mouth. Guardians can then head into Riven’s mouth and to her heart, finishing off the boss with one final DPS burst.&nbsp;From there,&nbsp;Riven will&nbsp;be defeated, but Guardians still have one final step before the Last Wish Raid is complete.&nbsp;All that’s left is the relay race known as the Queenswalk.</p>

<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga</em> is finally out, following on from the award-winning 2017 hit by Ninja Theory. Despite the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-says-it-needs-smaller-prestigious-games-right-after-killing-the-studio-behind-the-small-prestigious-hi-fi-rush/">bleakness that appears to accompany the gaming world</a> at the moment, many have been looking forward to this release, so it’s worth going over the basics of what systems you can play it on.</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Now, being as it’s published by Xbox Game Studios, it stands to reason that <em>Hellblade 2</em> is exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S. And, indeed, it is. It’s also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, where it’s currently looking pretty good, with a current review score of “Very Positive.” But it’s early days yet.</p> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">However, there’s likely to be a few PlayStation users out there who will be wondering whether the game will come to the PS5. Currently, there don’t appear to be any plans to release it on Sony’s systems. However, in this humble reporter’s opinion, the fact that Xbox is making some of its exclusives available on rival consoles suggests it may not be out of the realms of possibility just yet. Don’t quote me on that, though.</p>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">So, quick summary: <em>Hellblade 2</em> is <strong>available on Xbox Series X|S and PC only</strong>. It’s also available on Game Pass, so that’s something.</p> <h2 id="h-decks-out-for-ninja-theory" data-injectable="false">Decks out for Ninja Theory</h2> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Of course, we’re talking about a new game you can get on Steam, so the next question is to ask whether it’s also compatible with Valve’s Steam Deck.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Now, despite the general hype around <em>Hellblade 2</em>, the store page doesn’t show whether or not it’s verified or even playable on the portable device. However, it’s a fairly new release and it’s likely that Ninja Theory could tweak it for the system, so be on the lookout for future updates that mention that.</p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">Having said that, it’s worth checking out the below video:</p> <figure data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Steam Deck gameplay &amp; best settings" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl4iW-mhiSg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">According to the channel, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is playable on the Steam Deck, but with a few caveats. For starters, you’re unlikely to get a consistent framerate above 30fps, especially with additional graphics features turned on. Certain cutscenes and visually heavy sections of the game can even drop it to the low 20s.</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">There also appears to be a bit of ghosting as well as some blurring effects, depending on which settings you’ve enabled.</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false">So, yes, it is <em>playable</em> on the Deck, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride for much of it, it seems. If you have the PC hardware to run it, it’s probably best to stick with that. Failing that, Nvidia has added the game to its <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGFN/status/1792948768892944647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce NOW</a> cloud service, if that’s your bag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161071/doctor-who-steven-moffat-boom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="78nCF5">You could probably consider it a law, like gravity: Any popular entertainment fortunate enough to amass a fandom will eventually find said fandom at odds with at least some of its creative team. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-trek">Star Trek</a> probably invented it (what the hell, it’s invented every other <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033366/star-trek-sexiest-episodes-ranked">modern pop culture quirk</a>), but most every fanbase has experienced it. In the realm of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/10/5/17938178/doctor-who-tardis-black-fans">21st-century <em>Doctor Who </em>fandom</a> specifically, this nexus of passion and ire is centered around writer Steven Moffat.</p>
<p id="Jz8fPz">Mostly known at the time for the BBC sitcom <em>Coupling</em>, Moffat very quickly began to establish a reputation as one of the most exciting writers working under then-showrunner Russell T. Davies’ 2005 revival of <em>Doctor Who</em>, a guy who would drop in every season for a standalone episode or two-parter that reliably brought the house down. When Moffat took over as <em>Who </em>showrunner in series 5, at the start of Matt Smith’s tenure as the Eleventh Doctor, it didn’t seem like there was a better pick. </p>
<p id="0uPsqG">The grass is always greener though, and while the man responsible for two-thirds of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/5/18127351/tumblr-ban-content-memes-community">SuperWhoLock era of internet fandom</a> had amassed a zealous following, he had a rockier go of it as the man in charge. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23172599/steven-moffat-tv-doctor-who-sherlock">Moffat fell out of favor</a> as audiences tired of his recklessly plotty vision and smug voice, and <em>Doctor Who</em> entered a fallow period — only to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979689/doctor-who-the-star-beast-review">brought to vibrant life by Davies once again</a>. And so an old dynamic re-asserts itself, 20 years later, with Russell T. Davies steering the ship, and — surprise — Steven Moffat back as his ringer. </p>

<p id="EW93Iu">“Boom,” the third episode (fourth if you count <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24016644/doctor-who-christmas-special-review">the Christmas special</a>, which Disney Plus does) of the Davies 2.0 era of <em>Doctor Who </em>is such a return to form for Moffat that it is genuinely astounding. With the exception of a brief prologue, “Boom” is a bottle episode in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-club-33-movie-darren-lemke-shawn-levy-1235904632/">the truest sense of the word</a>, taking place on one set and revolving around a very simple problem: The Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) has stepped on a sci-fi landmine on an alien world and cannot move without setting it off. </p>
<p id="hKiPvA">What makes “Boom” such a gripping hour of television is the way that it takes its premise and adds layer after layer of thematic and dramatic tension, loading its dilemma with nigh-unbearable levels of stress. The planet the Doctor and companion Ruby Sunday are visiting? It’s embroiled in a never-ending war. The soldiers are Anglican Marines, a faction of religious soldiers <em>Who</em> fans will remember from Moffat’s tenure as showrunner. They will never stop fighting, even if they don’t know why, and there’s <em>definitely</em> reason to doubt why. A girl’s father goes missing, and she thinks the Doctor knows where — whoops, now that’s a life imperiled, because she doesn’t realize the Doctor’s predicament. Making matters even <em>worse </em>is a small fleet of AI-piloted robots designed by an arms manufacturer to keep the battle running smoothly and <em>profitably</em>. </p>
<p id="gQwAhO">In “Boom,” Moffat’s long-established tics — showy, caustic dialog and an inclination towards sentiment — are once again strengths here. Like a lot of the best <em>Who</em> writers, Moffat understands that the Doctor feels most special not when he’s merely being smart, but when he’s <em>communicating</em>; when he’s talking his way out of trouble by showing empathy, not just by being clever. In Moffat’s worst moments of excess, this results in a Doctor that is self-satisfied at being the cleverest in the room, arrogant in his own intellect. At his best though, in the hands of a talented, emotive actor like Ncuti Gatwa? It’s remarkable theater, as a man desperately tries to connect with people who have no reason to listen to him, who have been <em>conditioned</em> against everything he might have to say. </p>
<p id="NttD3F">And, of course, there’s a bit of classic Moffat devilishness to the affair, a joke and a dare in the episode’s very premise: An alien who can travel to all of time and space, stuck in one spot. Will we still watch? </p>

The base Hero Mastery mode, which creates hero-specific obstacle courses that have been rolling out in waves since September, will continue, with more hero courses expected in future seasons. The full message reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As we prepare for Season 11, we’ve taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played. Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn’t resonated with players in the ways that we hoped. With this in mind, we have decided to discontinue Hero Mastery Gauntlet as a permanent mode, and it will not be available to play starting in Season 11.</p><p>Players have until the end of Season 10 to complete the Lifetime Challenges for Hero Mastery Gauntlet and compete on the mode’s Top 500 leaderboards.</p><p>Thanks to all of you who jumped into the Gauntlet. If you are still looking to improve your hero skills, Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, and there will be more Hero Mastery Solo Courses coming in upcoming seasons. We’ll see you in-game!</p></blockquote><p>The next season of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>begins on June 18, so you have a little over three weeks to play through Hero Mastery Gauntlet. Ultimately, it’s not that big of a loss compared to the likelihood that the entire story campaign was canned after Activision Blizzard’s layoffs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">gutted the team in January</a></span>, but every time <em>Overwatch 2 </em>loses a new game mode its justification of that sequel title feels more nebulous than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the past few months and years, Microsoft has been talking a lot about bringing Xbox to “every screen”. While details on that remain both scarce and confusing, a new claim from journalist Jez Corden of Windows Central gives a bit of insight into what they looks like.</p>



<p>In speaking on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93N7Uu3-9s&amp;t=5409s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden spoke about what he’s heard about the cocept.</p>



<p>“I actually have some details on exactly what Xbox on every screen looks like now,” he said. “And I think what it is, is that every Xbox game will have a consistent social UI across all the games, so like if you’re playing Sea of Thieves, for example, on the PlayStation, you will be able to bring up a mini Xbox guide, or something like that. Kind of like Battlenet, sort of.”</p>



<p>Corden then added that it’s at the point in development that it has a codename within Xbox called Roseway.</p>



<p>Obviously this is likely just a small part of Microsoft’s larger plan for an “Xbox on every screen”. The company is still working on next-gen hardware, a possible handheld device, and even improvements to its cloud gaming offering.</p>

            <p>
Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has a new CEO.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, it was announced that Shams Jorjani - who was previously part of the team that published Arrowhead's game, Magicka - will take over the leadership role at the company, replacing founder Johan Pilestedt. 
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt will remain in a leadership position following this change, and will now serve as Arrowhead's chief creative officer and chairman.

<p>
"We were both at a stage where we're wondering what's next in our careers," Jorjani told Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">GamesIndustry.biz</a> today. "And we realised we probably couldn't quite get to those places if we didn't have the other one to help us get there."
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt added: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how we are going to take Arrowhead into the future."
</p>
<p>
The pair likened themselves to Frodo and Sam from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy making their way to Mordor. "The oblivious approach of 'we'll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come'," Pilestedt said, adding the "strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other".

<p>
Elsewhere in the conversation, the duo also touched on any potential acquisitions following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">the huge success of Helldivers 2</a>. For now, the plan is for Arrowhead to remain an independent studio. "I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard," Pilestedt said. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, while the focus for the team remains on Helldivers 2 for now, Arrowhead is also looking to the future and what may come next. 
</p>
<p>
"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt shared. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani added Arrowhead's goal is to "make really great co-op games", and ultimately turn the company into a "flagship studio, where people who want to make these kinds-of games say to themselves: 'I want to work at Arrowhead'". 
</p>
<p>
The newly-appointed CEO stated this does not mean the studio will suddenly begin employing 500+ members of staff. "We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself," he said. "We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."
</p>
<p>
"We don't run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist," Pilestedt closed.
</p>

Elsewhere in Arrowhead news, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-mulling-slightly-lower-update-frequency-after-hectic-first-few-months">Helldivers 2 team is considering a "slightly lower" update frequency</a> after a busy first few months.
</p>
<p>
"We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches," Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard explained on Discord. "We feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve."

</p>
<p>This follows on from Pilestedt's earlier admission that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">Helldivers 2 balancing has sometimes "gone too far"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead Game Studios has appointed a new CEO, but don't worry; former CEO Johan Pilestedt isn't going anywhere.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, ex-Paradox and Hooded Horse exec Shams Jorjani will step into the CEO role at Arrowhead, while Pilestedt will remain the studio's CCO (chief creative officer) and chairman.</p>

<p>Pilestedt says that appointing a new CEO will allow him to focus more on the creative side of game development. He says that having a "reluctant CEO" at the head of Arrowhead would not "turn out that well", and that this decision was made "for the success of the business but also myself".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=0eLEkLek 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=mZCkFcpU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a new CEO in town at&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>studio Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as looking after the health of Arrowhead, it's possible that Pilestedt's decision to appoint a new CEO was inspired partially by the recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PlayStation ID controversy.</p>

<p>If you missed out on that, here's a quick refresher. When&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>launched on PC, it was originally intended to require a PlayStation ID linked to your Steam account to play, but that requirement was temporarily postponed owing to technical problems.</p>

<p>After a few months, it was announced that Arrowhead and Sony would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">once again</a> require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PC players to have a PlayStation ID to play, and the community responded with outrage and fury, review bombing the game on Steam in droves.</p>

<p>The requirement was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">eventually rescinded</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s user reviews returned to normal, but not before&nbsp;the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">delisted in a number of countries</a> that don't allow PSN accounts to be created.</p>

<p>It's possible this incident contributed to spooking Pilestedt into dealing with the appointment of a new CEO sooner rather than later.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-bile-titan.jpg?itok=luYeV9-S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-bile-titan.jpg?itok=JNGIEsyF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt wants to focus on development rather than business.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Jorjani's philosophy as Arrowhead's CEO, he <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> he wants the company to be a "flagship studio" for which people aspire to work, akin to From Software or Blizzard in its prime.</p>

<p>Despite that, Jorjani says he doesn't want Arrowhead to be a "500-person company", describing that possibility as "quite painful in a lot of ways".</p>

<p>Instead, Jorjani says he wants growth at Arrowhead to be "a means to an end" and says the studio has no plans to go public. Pilestedt adds that the Arrowhead team isn't running the studio for profit, but "the desire to just make great games".</p>

    <p>John Krasinski’s weird, ugly fantasy movie is the worst kind of nostalgia-bait, aimed directly at millennials</p>

  <p id="LuZ4Jq">Who is <em>IF </em>for? Looking at any of the film’s marketing or the trailer, the answer seems easy: kids. But after seeing <em>IF</em>, written and directed by John Krasinski (a considerable departure from his <em>A Quiet Place</em> movies), that answer stops seeming so simple. This “family comedy” isn’t particularly family-friendly, or particularly comedic. There are, at most, a handful of lines resembling jokes. Judging by the restlessness of the children in my screening, it isn’t for them at all.</p>
<p id="Jh5cyU"><em>IF </em>feels more like a film targeted at millennial parents: It’s overflowing with symbols of millennial childhood. Characters listen to music on cherished vinyl records, and tap into their memories not on iPhones, but on old video cameras. Cellphones aren’t part of this world. Everything from the carnival rides to the furniture seems to come from the 1990s. </p>
<p id="6G0D6u">Plot-wise, that focus on millennial nostalgia makes sense. <em>IF</em> centers on 12-year-old Bea (Cailey Fleming), who recently lost her mother, and may soon lose her father (John Krasinski) as well: He’s about to have heart surgery. Bea discovers she and her neighbor Cal (Ryan Reynolds) can see other people’s abandoned imaginary friends, and they launch a quest to reunite these “IF”s with the kids who imagined them, in order to keep the IFs – and people’s imaginations — alive. </p>

<p id="QDba6t"><em>IF </em>is all about how comforting and wonderful nostalgia is. This is an extremely familiar theme in current culture. Marketing trends have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfriedman/2016/08/02/why-nostalgia-marketing-works-so-well-with-millennials-and-how-your-brand-can-benefit/?sh=5007b5ba3636">pushing the nostalgia agenda</a>. The same thing is happening in pop culture, with popular ’80s and ’90s films and shows from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22280848/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-curse-of-the-shadows-review"><em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Rugrats</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645071/oscars-2023-avatar-the-way-of-water-top-gun-maverick-new-sincerity"><em>Top Gun</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/22/18682634/toy-story-4-ending-spoilers-forky-sequel"><em>Toy Story</em></a> being rebooted and reimagined. This constant refreshing of the old is known as nostalgia-bait. Even ostensibly new shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> are kept alight by the warm, enticing glow of nostalgia. </p>
<p id="mklcFZ">While it can be exhausting to exist in a world that seems terrified of anything new, the rampant obsession with and reliance on nostalgia does make sense. Millennials have faced <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-april/index.html">endlessly increasing costs</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/01/22/why-career-stability-is-overrated-in-todays-world/?sh=471a4c1b6e55">poor job stability</a>, and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-half-gen-z-millennial-103546494.html">climate crisis</a> with no end in sight, making it seem impossible to get a leg up. We’re the first generation to be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/11/politics/millennials-income-stalled-upward-mobility-us/index.html">worse off than the one before</a>. Wanting to retreat backward into familiar, comforting childhood wish-fulfillment is a logical next step. </p>
<p id="IodGIr">Krasinski’s film, however, employs nostalgia-bait in the worst imaginable way. Instead of rehashing familiar iconography to create new ideas, <em>IF </em>employs a barrage of fluffy, calorie-free whimsy, encouraging audiences to retreat backward into themselves and cling to the imaginary creatures from their childhood. The real world, it argues, is simply too hard, too painful.</p>

<p id="DDALP0"><em>IF</em>’s human characters are incapable of facing reality. Bea’s father is obsessed with using fantasy to make things easier for Bea. When we first see him in the hospital, he’s playing with his IV bag, which he’s dressed up with a wig to make it more appealing for his daughter. This infantilization — Bea constantly reminds him that she’s not a child, in a plea for an honest conversation — prevents her from being able to cope with the potential reality of losing both her parents at age 12. That’s a truly horrifying prospect, but <em>IF </em>treats Bea’s father like a hero, and is warmly receptive to both her retreat into the imaginary and the film’s eventual reminder that the past is exactly where she belongs. </p>
<p id="s8MEqI">Given that <em>IF</em> purports to celebrate the infinite nature of imagination, it’s telling that every IF in the movie is a generic variation of readily available toys, like stuffed animals, robots, and astronauts. Even the film’s primary IF, giant purple furry Blue (Steve Carell), is little more than a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23761120/mcdonalds-grimace-shake-game-boy-birthday-pride-memes">Grimace</a> knock-off. Some IFs are, conceptually speaking, even lazier — a bubble, a banana, a sunflower, a giant gummy bear, a literal ice cube in a glass. </p>
<p id="DCfgAJ">In fact, the one solitary chuckle I let out over the course of the movie’s 104-minute run time was when said ice cube (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reveals that his kid imagined him during a moment of thirst. The surprise factor on that line got me to laugh, but the joke is alarmingly hollow, and it gets to the root of the film’s problem. The best this kid could come up with to satisfy their thirst was <em>a glass of water with an ice cube in it</em>? Not, say, an infinite fountain of all their favorite flavors of lemonade and soft drinks, including flavors not yet conceived? Perhaps a free vending machine full of tantalizing, Willy Wonka-esque magical beverages? Or at least a glass of apple juice?</p>

<p id="XMKfda">If <em>IF </em>was a smarter movie, I’d take this parade of overly obvious, unimaginative imaginary characters to be a comment on how infantilized this forced obsession with nostalgia has become — a warning that our nostalgia-coddled minds are incapable of conjuring any legitimately original images, relying exclusively on variations of familiar themes. The most subversive interpretation of this movie is that Krasinski is actually saying all we can do is revel in our past, which is deeply concerning. But believing that would mean completely misunderstanding what <em>IF </em>is so blatantly <em>meant</em> to say.  </p>
<p id="0iiDXn">[<strong>Ed. note: </strong>From here, major <em>IF </em>spoilers.]</p>
<p id="S7JIbq">The reunification between adults and their childhood imaginary friends is a key aspect of <em>IF</em>. A pivotal scene finds Blue discovering his creator-child Jeremy is now an ineffectual, anxiety-ridden adult (played by Bobby Moynihan), preparing for a big business meeting. Jeremy is deeply unhappy, you see, because he’s an adult, and there’s no joy in that. He can only find any semblance of joy in this unfeeling world when Bea and Cal help Jeremy remember Blue. The whimsy hits toxically high levels as Jeremy and Blue glow with an orange hue, and Michael Giacchino’s constant, over-the-top score signals that finally, Jeremy is at peace. As Jeremy retreats into his own childhood, he’s able to crush the meeting he was so worried about. </p>
<p id="m1Nz5v">If the message wasn’t abundantly clear then, it becomes unavoidable in the film’s big reveal: Cal isn’t Bea’s neighbor, he’s her own childhood IF. The fact that our protagonist imagined a generic adult man as her imaginary friend really exposes how lazy this film thinks childhood imaginations are.</p>

<p id="S5VI5D">But it’s more sinister than that, <em>IF </em>suggests: The only reason Bea was able to process her complicated feelings and the potential loss of her father was that she retreated from adolescence and dove head-first into the recesses of her early childhood. The film’s final sequence backs this up further, as the lost IFs are reunited with their adults, all of whom seem instantly transformed to see the creatures they created as kids. The resulting montage of loving, happy faces is meant to be tear-jerking, but it feels ugly — an absolute repudiation of reality and adult life, in favor of the emptiest, most imagination-drained fantasies possible. </p>
<p id="2HjSqP">Instead of nostalgia-bait, <em>IF </em>has created a nostalgia trap. This is a movie that vehemently rejects one of life’s greatest features — growth and development — and encourages us to live inside our pasts. It isn’t really any safer there. But as far as Krasinski and the filmmakers are concerned, at least pretending it is feels comforting. </p>

<p>MADFINGER Games has pushed out Gray Zone Warfare’s first major patch, addressing hundreds of issues in the game and improving stability across the board. Since it was suddenly released on April 30, GZW has taken the extraction shooter world by storm, giving players a vast open-world environment to explore either alone or with teammates, searching for loot and completing more than 150 tasks.</p>

      </div>
<p>For now, Arrowhead plans to remain independent and it doesn't foresee a massive increase in its workforce. "We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "We have to see what the future holds, but there's nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p><p>Jorjani added that the studio still aims to make "really great co-op games" and transform Arrowhead into a big name in the games industry. "When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that," Jorjani said. "But that doesn't mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."</p><p>Pilestedt added that the two don't run the company for monetary gain, as the "humbleness and the desire to just make great games" is the driving force behind them.</p><p>Helldivers 2 has been very successful on PC and PS5, as Sony revealed that the game sold 12 million units at launch to become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. This eclipses the previous record set by God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-5-million-copies-in-a-week-becomes-fastest-selling-first-party-playstation-game/1100-6509445/" data-ref-id="1100-6509445">which sold 5 million copies in the first week</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 is the best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>.</p>

A new teaser shows what looks like Snooty Steppes featuring a post-apocalyptic makeover, plus confirms that the T-60 power armor will appear in the battle-royale game soon with Chapter 5 Season 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Fortnite account <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1793056269177360818" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) posted a brief 2-second clip that was packed full of small details. For instance, there are several color styles of Fallout's power armor on display. One character uses some sort of new item, like a nitro juice that can splash onto teammates. Additionally, the short video seems to showcase a variety of weapons: the laser rifle, mini-gun, harpoon gun, and repeater.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-teases-fallout-crossover-ahead-of-post-apocalyptic-season-3/1100-6523546/" data-ref-id="1100-6523546">Fortnite teased the Fallout crossover</a> for a rumored post-apocalyptic theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/#3" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Chapter 5 Season 3, which should begin this weekend</a>. That's because Season 2 is slated to end this Friday, May 24. A previous image hinted at a Nitro Dome for the upcoming season, with thoughts that a Mad Max collaboration could be in the cards, too. However, that hasn't been announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-just-did-something-its-never-done-before/1100-6523556/" data-ref-id="1100-6523556">Fortnite Festival just did something it's never done before</a> by offering three new tracks from Billie Eilish at the same time they were officially released.

<p data-characters="312" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After 15 years of running Arrowhead Games Studio, Johan Pilestedt has confirmed he will no longer serve as its CEO. Going forward, that position will be filled by one Shams Jorjani, an industry veteran who previously worked at fellow Swedish company Paradox Interactive as its chief business development officer.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Does this mean Pilestedt is leaving Arrowhead altogether? No, as he explains in this interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he will remain as the studio’s chief creative officer and chairman. The change in leadership is so Pilestedt can dedicate himself to game creation once again; something he hasn’t been able to do as much as CEO.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false">“I realised that running an organisation of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track,” says Pilestedt. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">“Over the last year going to launch of <em>Helldivers 2</em>, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realise I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.”</p>
 <p data-characters="734" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was a pivotal release for Arrowhead, what with it being its first game since the original <em>Helldivers </em>launched in 2015. Not only was this a sequel fans had waited years for, but it was also set up as one of the PlayStation 5’s few major exclusives for 2024. And with it becoming more popular than anybody expected (even becoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>), Arrowhead needs strong leadership in order to keep its playerbase appeased and potentially grow the studio. As such, Pilestedt believes him stepping back from the CEO position is ultimately for the best, not just for himself but for Arrowhead: “Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>
 <p data-characters="654" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">With Pilestedt getting to be more hands-on with <em>Helldivers 2</em>, the aforementioned Shams Jorjani will handle, in his own words, “a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.” Aside from his time at Paradox, Jorjani has served as the chairman of Hooded Horse, the indie game publisher which released another surprise success of 2024, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/manor-lords-surpasses-devs-wildest-expectations-with-more-than-2m-copies-sold-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Manor Lords</em></a>, just last month.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Time will tell if this winds up being the right move for the company, but I can understand why Pilestedt would want to leave business side of things to someone else. No matter the field, creatives want to, well, create things, and you don’t really get to do that if you’re too busy running a company to make sure it stays afloat.</p>

Fortnite's new season - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">which includes a Fallout collaboration</a> - kicks off on Friday, and we've now gotten a glimpse of how the T-60 Power Armour will look in-game. 
</p>
<p>
A brief snippet of gameplay footage - our first from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-estimated-release-date-9406">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</a> - shows the iconic armour as seen in the Fallout games and recent TV series, stomping towards the camera. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite fans may note this location is a much-changed version of Snooty Steppes, wrecked by the upcoming arrival of an enormous sandstorm. 
</p>

<p>
The footage also shows an array of new and returning weapons set for use in the new season, including a new flamethrower weapon and gun with a harpoon on the end, a laser rifle and some kind of Mad Max-style area-of-effect healing item that grants a speed boost.
</p>
<p>
Returning weapons for next season look to include the minigun and ranger shotgun, meanwhile. Here it is to watch:

<p>
Back to the Power Armour, it looks like there will be multiple types on offer, with theming consistent to Fortnite's own Red Knight and Black Knight styles (as spotted by FortniteLeaks).
</p>
<p>
It's possible the Power Armour is offered as some kind of power-up for any character, though it seems more likely the armour is its own skin, with different variants available to unlock. 
</p>
<p>
The new Fortnite battle royale season is set to go live this Friday morning, with previous leaks pointing to upcoming Metallica, Monster Trucks, Pirates of the Caribbean collaborations - plus even more Marvel.
</p>
<p>
Last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">mini live event saw vengeful Greek god Zeus enact his revenge</a> - and an ominous-looking sandstorm unleashed on the Island's horizon.
</p>
<p>Head in-game now and you'll spot the area of the Island closest to the sandstorm is now experiencing the storm's first effects, with dirt and leaves blown around. It's a nice touch. Look further out towards the storm and you can also make out an enormous boat on its way, painted to look like a shark's head. I wonder if that'll be a new location on the Island when it arrives?
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-stars-wars-mods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Someone has turned Bethesda's Starfield into an open-world Star Wars game with over 100 mods.</p>
<p>We are still eagerly waiting for the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-creation-kit-modders-make-their-own-planet-stories-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Creation Kit</a> from Bethesda, but a dedicated player has basically made a Star Wars total conversion package for last year's sci-fi title. As said, this open-world Star Wars conversion uses over 100 mods, including several popular Starfield mods as well as custom mods and files. As mentioned by creator 'DeityVengy', this is still a work in progress, and each day, additional mods are being discovered that are being added to the package. "This is still a huge work in progress", the creator writes. "Every day I discover a mod or two to add to this as well as new mods releasing every day. I can't wait to see what the future holds with Bethesda's upcoming creation kit."</p>
<p>We've included a video showing off this impressive Star Wars conversion for Starfield below. The main mods included are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mandalorian Suit</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aliens</em></li>
<li><em>UC Empire</em></li>
<li><em>Freestar Rebels</em></li>
<li><em>Shadow Collective - Crimson Fleet Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Purge Troopers</em></li>
<li><em>Hugin's Ecliptic Bounty Hunters</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aurebesh Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Starfield HD Overhaul</em></li>
<li><em>Boostpack to Jetpack</em></li>
<li><em>Unified Camera</em></li>
<li><em>Slightly Better Weapon Icons</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="I Turned Starfield Into the Ultimate Star Wars Game... 100+ Mods | Improvements | Raytracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydaWXoidoo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Detailed instructions on how to install the mods can be found on <a href="https://github.com/DeityVengy/Ultimate-Star-Wars-Conversion-Modlist-for-Starfield/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github here</a>. There you'll also find the full list of mods used.</p>
<p>Starfield is available for PC and Xbox Series X|S now. As expected, this Star Wars total conversion is currently only available for the PC version. Here's what we wrote about Starfield in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year: "With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hunt: Showdown Won’t Work on PS4 or Xbox One From August]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-won%E2%80%99t-work-on-ps4-or-xbox-one-from-august.878220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently revealed by Crytek that an impending upgrade to CryEngine – which was the engine used to build Hunt: Showdown – will take the extraction shooter offline on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from August 15, 2024. Once this update has been applied, the game won’t even load on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles – but it’s not all bad news.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upgrade-for-free">Upgrade for Free</h2>



<p>Those impacted by the shutdown will be able to update to the next-generation version of Hunt: Showdown for free, Crytek revealed. In a video posted online to celebrate the upcoming upgrade, it was said that player accounts and all entitlements for Hunt: Showdown will port across from the older version of the game with ease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Your player accounts and entitlements to Hunt: Showdown and all related DLCs carry up to the new version at no additional cost when you’re ready to make the hardware transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been promised that a ‘new era’ of Hunt: Showdown will emerge in the summer with the arrival of CryEngine 5.11. For this ‘new generation’ of Hunt: Showdown, the team is working intensively on the game’s anti-cheat system, a new user interface, a recruitment and prestige system, and tweaks to the game’s Hunter mechanics. </p>



<p>There’s an inbound overhaul for the game’s core map, which will incorporate new locations and fresh threats – but only on the next-generation version of the game.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793267296682520846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> from Johan Pilestedt, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has appointed Shams Jorjani as its new CEO. </p>



<p>Following this change in leadership, Pilestedt also confirmed that they are “taking the role of Chief Creative Officer”. As a result, they plan to “spend more time with the team and 100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>



<figure><div>

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesIndustry.biz</a> today, Pilestedt elaborated on the decision to hire a new CEO. They explained that “I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side.”</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that “I will have to follow my heart,” and that “having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>



<p>Jorjani stated that “what I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership,” citing their experience with Paradox.</p>



<p>Although Helldivers 2 recently faced a lot of backlash over its PSN updates, the team responded swiftly. Ultimately, the game earned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200,000 positive reviews</a> in a single day after the devs reacted quickly to fan criticism.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 continues to perform exceptionally well, as Arrowhead’s new CEO joins the team. A recent financial report revealed that Helldivers 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 12 million units</a> in just 12 weeks. </p>

    <p><span>A decision of company founder Johan Pilestedt, who will remain chief creative officer and chairman.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has appointed former <a title="Companies > Paradox Interactive [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox Interactive</a> executive Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role, the company announced. <span id="more-884076"></span></p><p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman of Arrowhead Game Studios. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he explained that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on game creation versus the business side of things.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we’re going to be making, and running the organization beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,” Pilestedt said. “I realized that running an organization of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.”</p><p>He continued, “Over the last year going to launch of <em>Helldivers II</em>, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realize I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p><p>“So I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p><p>“After some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It’s not only right for me, but it’s also right for the organization. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Jorjani was at Paradox Interactive for more than 12 years, serving in roles such as chief business development officer, vice president of business development, and vice president of products. He is also a chairman of the board and investor in independent publisher <a title="Companies > Hooded Horse [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hooded-horse">Hooded Horse</a>, and an investor in <a title="Companies > CULT Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cult-games">CULT Games</a>.</p><p>“When you’re talking to creatives like Johan, it’s not like he wants to retire,” Jorjani said. “<em>Helldivers II</em> isn’t the highlight of his career. Hopefully it’s the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance… all the things that led us here.</p><p>“What I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was… it was about organization, leadership and business focus. It’s a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p><p>“Bethesda has Todd Howard, <a title="Companies > Kojima Productions [548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kojima-productions">Kojima Productions</a> has Kojima, Remedy has Sam <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a>… but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director… you can’t name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.</p><p>“So that’s the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more <em>Helldivers</em>, and what I bring is a structure around that.”</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios is an independent game developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
