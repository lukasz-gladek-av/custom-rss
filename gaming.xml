            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/the-first-berserker-khazan-may-update-adds-hardcore-boss-rush-modes-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> is set to arrive this week on 15th May, adding a “hardcore difficulty” boss rush modes to the game. But that’s not all, as developer Neople has also previewed what to expect in updates through June.</p>
<p>The 15th May update will add two boss rush modes to address the desire for a hardcore difficulty. Instead of just being hard for hard’s sake, Creative Director Junho Lee explained,”It had to be fun, something that’s tough but rewarding. A mode you’d be proud to conquer and eager to show off.”</p>


<p>The update will add a new Boss Rush (Ultimate Challenge) menu on the title screen after beating the main campaign. The two Boss Rush modes have different difficulty and progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>“Great General’s Crucible”</b> – Fight through groups of thematically organized bosses, unlocking the next theme each time you clear one. You’ll fight with designated specs (gear, level, skills, etc.), and completing all of them will earn you a special reward.</li>
<li><b>“Berserker’s Bloodshed”</b> – Make your character stronger with rewards earned from consecutive fights, and push all the way to defeat the final boss. As a final reward, you can earn powerful new weapons and set items.</li>
</ul>
<p>The update will also let you change your appearance in the main game once you’ve completed the Blacksmith’s Heirloom mission.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, an update projected for late May or early June will add some quality of life features to help address requests for shortcut resets and faster boss retries. In the traditional sense, Neople determined that the game structure would not allow straight up fulfilment of those requests. Instead they will implement:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New items added to allow fast traveling to the Crevice or the last Blade Nexus you interacted with:</b> We’ll be adding items that let you instantly move to the Crevice or to the last Blade Nexus you interacted with. These will be provided as permanent items, not consumables.</li>
<li><b>Added teleport between from one Blade Nexus to another:</b> You’ll be able to freely move from one Blade Nexus to another activated in the same mission. Interacting with a Blade Nexus will display a list of available destinations.</li>
<li>After clearing certain <b>missions for farming purposes, you will now start right in front of the Spectral Portal</b> before entering that mission. You’ll no longer have to travel long distances through the Mortal World for a quick retry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, targeting late June, Neople are working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Skill balance adjustments for Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear</li>
<li>[Balance Adjustment] Adjustment to set effect configurations</li>
<li>[New System] Skill Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Gear Presets</li>
<li>[New System] Increase Gear Grades</li>
<li>[New System] Change Weapon Scaling</li>
<li>[QoL] New Sorting Option: Sorting Items by Name</li>
<li>[QoL] Storage Expansion</li>
<li>And… More Special Contents Coming</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot more detail and explanation of the development choices <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543356943483274341">by Junho Lee on the Steam announcement page</a>, but there’s the cliff notes.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is an enjoyable game that we awarded 8/10 back in March. Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/the-first-berserker-khazan-review/">our review</a> that it’s “not reinventing anything by any means, but is consistently fun to play. The visuals are lovely, the action is a lot of fun thanks to ever-evolving skill trees, and the boss designs are great too. If you’re after a Soulslike challenge, it can fit that bill in some ways, but it should also have a broader appeal thanks to the easy mode and more.”</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was one of the bright spots in 2020, and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> on the horizon in July, fans are hoping this isn't the last remastered Tony Hawk game we'll see. Even Tony Hawk himself doesn't want this to be the end, and would like to see Activision move on to the Tony Hawk's Underground games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/tony-hawks-underground-remake-campaign/">ScreenRant</a>, Hawk was asked about whether the Underground games had entered his conversations with Activision. He admitted that they hadn't necessarily talked about the Underground games, but Hawk did make it clear that he would like to see it happen, and that he'll be doing his best to make it happen.</p>
<p>"<em>I always have aspirations</em>," Hawk said. "<em>It's not up to me, generally. I'll campaign all I can, but I'm working with a much bigger company that's a lot smarter than me.</em>"</p>
<p>It seems that if it were up to Tony Hawk to make the call as to what the next remastered games would be, he'd have Activision work their way through the rest of the series, with Underground 1+2 next. But the chances of that will depend on how Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 goes.</p>
<p>And even then, it still might not happen. Even the fact that 3+4 is happening at all feels like something related to a miracle, since Activision had <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">originally said no to a pitch from Vicarious Visions for 3+4</a>, before Vicarious Visions was sunsetted and absorbed into Blizzard.</p>
<p>If THPS 3+4 is able to repeat and improve on the success that THPS 1+2, then we can remain hopeful that an Underground 1+2 remaster will be on the way. Until then, we can look forward to the fan remake that's underway, with the first Underground game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-tony-hawks-underground-remake/">remade in Unreal Engine 5.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-blaze-headset-review-audio-perfection-at-a-more-affordable-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>AceZone A-Blaze</h5><p><span>May 12th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone is far from being a widely recognizable brand, but there's no doubt that the Danish company deserves to be as popular as other headset manufacturers, as its products geared towards eSports are of the highest quality, and are absolutely worthy of their prices. The high prices of products such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-spire-wireless-for-the-most-demanding/">A-Spire Wireless</a> which I had the chance to try out earlier this year is effectively the only reason why it has failed to reached a wider audience, as some of its advanced features, such as its excellent Active Noise Cancelling tech, are great to have even in everyday usage like playing single player games that may not require the incredible audio accuracy the headset offers and even in not-intended use cases, like playing guitar or drums very loudly.</p>
<p>AceZone has been well aware of how the high price of their headsets prevented them from becoming more popular among players aiming to become the top of the pack in eSports games. As such, the Danish company has created the A-Blaze, a headset coming with a good portion of the features that make their other headsets excellent, but at a more palatable price. Even with some different features, is the A-Blaze a worthy addition to the AceZone headset lineup? It most definitely is, as only the most demanding players will miss the features removed from the A-Spire to make the new headset more affordable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the AceZone A-Blaze retailing for $199 when it will launch in the United States, €199 in Europe, where it can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.acezone.io/en-eu/products/a-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOorw9lp0mg5AhtVWNwd2IypEMNtpx_zYmEIikXJ3383Z_g4DWBkt">official website</a>, instead of the $369/€369 of the A-Spire Wireless, it's not surprising to see that the headset doesn't come with a hard carry case, but, at a glance, that seems the only significant difference with its more expensive counterpart. The A-Blaze sports the same design as the A-Spire, with an all black color scheme in place of the black and grey, which still looks great, and gives the headset a very professional look that is far removed from that of other gaming headsets that often sport vibrant designs and RGB lights. Packed together with the headset is a wireless dongle and a USB-C cable, allowing users to use the headset wirelessly and wired with ease. In both cases, the headset is instantly recognized on Windows 11, making for a proper, hassle-free plug and play experience that is very welcome, with extremely low audio latency, which is not surprising, as the A-Blaze, much like the A-Spire Wireless, features Bluetooth 5.4 powered by the newest chipset from Qualcomm. In terms of connectivity, however, the A-Blaze doesn't offer a traditional AUX connection, which could be an issue for console players who want to plug the headset into their controllers. Other than this very minor issue, using the headset on PlayStation 5 is just as simple as doing the same on PC, as it paired without any hassle with my launch model. With the same weight of 270 grams, the A-Blaze is as comfortable as the A-Spire. The built-in DSP also allows users to store their personalized settings in the headset itself, so the installation of software or using the mobile app is not required.</p>
<p>Besides a different color scheme and the lack of a traditional AUX connection, the other features removed from the A-Spire to make the AceZone A-Blaze more affordable are unlikely to be an issue for most users. The new headset has a less powerful Hybrid ANC and Noise Cancelling Microphone, which, to be honest, I wouldn't have realized if I didn't put the headset through some extreme tests. Like for the A-Spire headset, I used the A-Blaze while playing acoustic drums, and I had no trouble hearing the click and the backing track even when going all out during some intense progressive metal tunes. Same for the microphone, whose quality is just as good as that of the A-Spire microphone, even though it probably wouldn't be able to accomplish the same extreme noise cancelling as its more expensive counterpart is capable of. The A-Blaze's functionality via the mobile app is significantly reduced, as it doesn't support glasses mode, microphone equalizer, and adjustable ANC and transparency, which are features that only the most advanced audio-savvy users would be using for particular use cases. With a 45-hour battery life, compared to the 35 hours of the A-Spire, the A-Blaze at least comes up on top in this regard, and can be used for longer on a full charge, which is definitely good to have.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though it features less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC, the AceZone A-Blaze still features the same top-notch audio quality as the A-Spire. While AceZone developed their audio technology with eSport titles in mind, with a specific audio design, allowing users to hear sounds that are almost imperceptible on other headsets with incredible accuracy, it works incredibly well with pretty much every game, especially in those experiences meant to be immersive. In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, for example, I was able to hear sounds that were completely lost in the audio mix using some standard earbuds and headphones, making the experience more immersive than ever. In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the A-Blaze allowed me to listen to the game's fantastic soundtrack in the best possible way and hear some very soft guitar and keyboard passages that would have been lost otherwise. If you have even a remote interest in audio quality, there's really no better choice in gaming than the AceZone's headsets.</p>
<p>While the price point of $199/€199 may still be beyond the budget most gamers are willing to invest into a gaming headset, the A-Blaze is more than worthy purchase for all those who want to elevate their gaming experiences, no matter the type of game they usually play. As the features that have been removed from the more expensive A-Spire Wireless were geared towards the most demanding e-Sports games players, their removal shouldn't impact the target audience for the A-Blaze, ultimately making it a much more enticing purchase.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Featuring the same incredible audio quality and only slightly less powerful Advanced Hybrid ANC as the A-Spire - but at a considerably lower price - the AceZone A-Blaze is undoubtedly an excellent headset, more than worthy of its cost for those seeking the best product in its price range. Despite cutting a few features found in its more expensive counterpart—features unlikely to affect the vast majority of regular users—the headset retains a premium feel that sets it apart from nearly every other gaming headset, ditching unnecessary frills like RGB lighting in favor of features that truly matter and elevate the gaming experience.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The team of nearly 200 Activision Blizzard developers behind the <em>Overwatch</em> franchise has unionized. Formed under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild is the latest wall-to-wall Blizzard union to be recognized by parent company Microsoft since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment"><em>World of Warcraft</em> development team announced its own union</a> last July.</p><p><a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">The CWA announced on Friday</a> that “an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation.” The <em>Overwatch</em> union unit includes game developers across production, engineering, design, art, sound, and quality assurance, pushing for job security, salary, and layoff protection improvements.</p><p>“After a long history of layoffs, crunch, and subpar working conditions in the global video game industry, my coworkers and I are thrilled to be joining the broader union effort to organize our industry for the better, which has been long overdue,” organizing committee member Foster Elmendorf said in the CWA’s statement.</p><p>Allegations that Activision Blizzard fostered a workplace environment of toxicity and sexual harassment emerged following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay">lawsuit filed by the state of California in 2021</a>, prior to the company being acquired by Microsoft in 2023. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has denied that the company was responsible for reported abuse concerns and instead <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23744109/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-denies-harassment-variety">blamed the issues on labor organizers.</a> Following its $68.7 billion acquisition by Microsoft, Activision Blizzard agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003556/california-activision-blizzard-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">$54 million to settle the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>The CWA says that over 2,600 workers at Microsoft-owned gaming studios have now joined its ranks, including a union formed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">600 quality assurance workers employed at Activision</a> in March 2024. These strings of unionization efforts follow a labor neutrality agreement that was signed between the CWA and Microsoft in 2022 that made it easier for staffers at subsidiaries like Activision Blizzard to organize.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During PAX East 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox hosted a panel in which it revealed more details on the upcoming looter-shooter. One of the primary topics of conversation related to quality-of-life changes for co-op, as Gearbox is aiming to address complaints from previous games in the Borderlands series and apply these improvements to the sequel.</p><p>While we already know that the game will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-loot-system-offers-more-variety-than-ever-before/1100-6531246/" data-ref-id="1100-6531246">instanced loot for every player</a>, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford also commented on how Borderlands 4 will have dynamically scaled difficulty for each player in co-op as well, to keep the game fairly challenging. Other big upgrades include a completely revamped lobby system, drop-in and drop-out co-op, and best of all, fast-travel to friends. Borderlands 2 is currently on GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">best co-op games</a>, and while Borderlands 3 featured several improvements on this part of the gameplay experience, it wasn't a dramatic leap forward.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Co-op is a religion to us. If you play co-op, it is best-in-class co-op by far," Pitchford said. "We have revamped the lobby system so it's easier than ever to connect with people, easier to get into a co-operative game. It's drop-in and drop-out, none of this play for three hours and then you can start co-op. No, just get in, people can drop in and drop out."</p><p>The panel also touched on a few other topics, like the revamped loot chase--expect far fewer Legendary-class weapons in comparison to Borderlands 3--and the other two Vault Hunters joining Vex and Rafa were also revealed. In case you don't want to play as a Siren or a Tediore Exo-soldier, you can also choose to experience the game as Harlowe the Gravitar or Amon the Forge Knight.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will launch for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">on September 12</a>, but amidst soaring video game prices, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/">not even Pitchford knowswhat it will cost</a> when it arrives or if it'll be an $80 game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">upcoming Xbox Series X|S first-party titles</a>.</p>

                <p>Tati Gabrielle has already received misogynistic and racist backlash to playing the lead role in Naughty Dog's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. She said this in an interview, adding that Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has been "bootcamp-ing" her about what to expect in this department.</p><p>She told <a href="https://ew.com/tati-gabrielle-of-the-last-of-us-about-to-go-intergalactic-exclusive-11732492" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EW</a> that she's aware of the attacks that people like Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker received for their roles in The Last of Us game series, and she's now part of that club with her role as Jordan A. Mun in Intergalactic.</p><p>"I got a lot of love, but there was a lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of color, me having my head shaved, all these things that I didn't even actually initially see--I'm out of the social media zeitgeist for that reason--but once I did, Neil was like, 'Ignore it. No matter what, me and you, we're going to make something beautiful. We're going to make something that we're proud of,'" she said.</p><p>Bailey, who played Abby, previously discussed the response to her playing the part, saying <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1ahe3jn/laura_bailey_discusses_the_death_threats_sent_to/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some people threatened the life of her newborn baby. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is expected to be a controversial game in part due to its subject matter focusing on faith and religion. But Intergalactic's story may not be what you might expect for a story about faith.</p><p>"The question of faith is not black and white," Gabrielle said. "When you initially think of faith, you think of religion, which is a part of it, but there's also faith in oneself. There's faith in your environment or your community. All that faith means is, 'What are your beliefs? What are the things that you hope for? Faith sounds flowery, but we all experience it day in and day out. What is your reason for waking up?'"</p><p>Gabrielle's history with Naughty Dog goes back to 2022's Uncharted movie, based on the Naughty Dog game, in which she played Braddock. She landed the role of Nora in HBO's The Last of Us after Druckmann saw her in that film, she said.</p><p>Outside of Naughty Dog projects, Gabrielle will play Jade in Mortal Kombat 2, which comes to theaters this October.</p><p dir="ltr">Intergalactic is Naughty Dog's first new IP in a decade. It's been in development since 2020 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html">more than 250 people at Naughty Dog alone</a> have worked on it over the years, in addition to external development support. Druckmann is directing, and the cast also includes Kumail Nanjiani and Tony Dalton.</p><p dir="ltr">Intergalactic will be scored by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails fame. As for when it will be released, no one should expect to play the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">until 2027 at the soonest. </a></p>

<p>Even more content will be added, so that this is more than a simple port, with details of this to come in a future Virtua Fighter update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/12/theres-a-doom-themed-slayeux-tapestry-hanging-at-the-royal-armouries-in-leeds-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> launching this week on 15th May (and advance access for Deluxe Edition from tomorrow), Bethesda has teamed up with the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds for a rather unique week-long event inspired by the game.</p>
<p>Behold, the “Slayeux Tapestry” at the heart of the ‘Welcome to the Dark Ages’ exhibit, which you can visit for free until Friday 16th May – <a href="https://royalarmouries.org/leeds/whats-on/slayeux-tapestry-doom-the-dark-ages.">head here for more information</a>.</p>



<p>The Slayeux Tapestry is an 11-metre hand-stitched display that depicts some of the battles that will feature in DOOM: The Dark ages, featuring the demons and monsters that you’ll face in combat. It’s inspired by the famed Bayeux Tapestry, in case you didn’t get the pun, which depicts the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. You really can’t get much more medieval than that, can you?</p>
<p>It’s the work of French illustrator Simon De Thuillières, who said, ‘It was a huge honour to reimagine the brutal saga of the DOOM Slayer through this medieval lens. I take a lot of inspiration from videogames, so transforming the Slayer’s epic battles into a tapestry steeped in medieval style was both a challenge and a thrill. I can’t wait to hear what fans think of the blend of history and hellfire.”</p>

<p>Florence Symington, Director of Brand and Audiences for the Royal Armouries: “We’re absolutely delighted to be partnering with Bethesda and the DOOM team, hosting this innovative new exhibition amongst our historic collection of arms and armour. We are always seeking ways to share our expertise and reach more people than ever before. Welcome to the Dark Ages offers a rare and exciting opportunity to engage new audiences with the rich heritage, artistry and history of arms and armour. Across the exhibition, visitors will get a fascinating insight into how centuries-old craftsmanship has influenced the weaponry and design of DOOM: The Dark Ages.”</p>
<p>The Welcome to the Dark Ages also dives into the weaponry you’ll use to rip and tear through the game, while venturing into the rest of the Royal Armouries lets you explore all manner of historical weapons, armours and objects. The exhibits include&nbsp;Japanese samurai armour and swords, famous movie props, the armours of Henry VIII, and the armour for an Indian war elephant.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is a cracking new entry in the iconic FPS franchise, visiting a different period in the Doom Slayer’s long history of demon battling. Stepping back to a Dark Ages-infused sci-fi period, there’s still plenty of exotic and technical weaponry, but you also now wield a chainsaw shield, have a gun that fires shards of skulls, and more.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">our DOOM: The Dark Ages review</a>, Miguel said, “DOOM: The Dark Ages is a fun and flashy shooter stuffed with engaging content – it’s a thrill-ride from beginning to end. In the shadow of DOOM Eternal, though, the more varied set-pieces and methodical combat cause its flame to burn just a bit less bright than I was hoping for.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-profits-down-despite-strong-sales-for-new-and-older-games.1186854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that its profits have fallen overall when compared to last year's figure, despite "strong" performances for releases like Atlus'&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal</em>.</p>

<p>In the legendary Japanese company's latest financial report, Sega reveals that its profit fell by around 17% compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-pachislots" rel="nofollow">last year's number</a>, although it's worth noting that its "entertainment" division (which comprises video games, but also movies and TV) actually saw profits rise.</p>

<p>Sega puts the increase in entertainment profit down to "strong performance" in various areas, including back catalog sales and revenue for the latest&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which helped the movie adaptations of the Blue Blur's adventures cumulatively cross $1 billion at the box office <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-profits-sonic-movies-shadow.jpg?itok=WqI4_tk1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-profits-sonic-movies-shadow.jpg?itok=kquuV3Fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movies are doing pretty well for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in entertainment, Sega points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">"strong" sales</a> of new IP&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, developed by ex-<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>staffers, as a motivating factor for increased profits in the sector. High sales for flagship&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>were also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">part of the studio's strength</a> in this area.</p>

<p>The company also says that "strong repeat sales" for back catalog titles&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal (Remaster)&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>helped to shore up its numbers in the entertainment department.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Sega doesn't report any figures on this front, so we don't know exactly where these titles stand in terms of numbers. We do, however, know that Atlus contributed 33 billion yen to its parent's figures for this year, with&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>putting 32.5 billion in the pot.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon</em>, another key studio franchise, put 11.5 billion yen in Sega's coffers, with sales of the most recent entry&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>being "steady", according to the company. This year also marked the release of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-yakuza-review-yakuza-tv-show-with-ip-paintjob" rel="nofollow">live-action show based on the IP</a>, although Sega doesn't say how well it did.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-financials.jpg?itok=jiw42NiF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-financials.jpg?itok=n7QUgu_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>are "steady", according to Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>All of these games helped somewhat to offset the costs incurred by the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">announced back in February</a> due to Sega and Sports Interactive's desire to focus instead on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>.</p>

<p>The entertainment sector's figures also helped somewhat to offset sharp losses in the pachinko and pachislot departments, although not quite to the degree of ensuring a rise in profits for the company, unfortunately.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that Sega's references to "gaming" throughout its financial report don't signify video games; rather, they're referring to casino gaming under the Sammy brand, and profits were actually up slightly under that umbrella as well.</p>

<p>That being said, Hawk said he'll make it his mission to "campaign all I can" to make it happen. But ultimately, Hawk said Activision will get to make the call.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> arrives later this week, and with physical editions now out in the wild, fans are expressing dismay amid reports the PS5 release includes just 85MB of data on the disc, with the Xbox Series X/S release seemingly not much bigger.
</p>
<p>
Rumblings of discontent over Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/some-retailers-have-broken-doom-the-dark-ages-street-date-and-huge-spoilers-are-already-out-there">over the weekend</a>, after one early receiver took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/nilynix/status/1920550232414183648">report the Xbox version contained just 342MB of data on the disc</a>. That was followed by an update on the PS5 version from Does it play?, an account dedicated to "[testing] commercial releases to ensure they work internet free."
</p>
<p>
Does it Play? <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920754796463636713">shared screenshots from a supporter</a> purportedly showing Doom: The Dark Ages' PS5 physical release contains just an 85.01MB "stub and a blocker to go online and update" on disc. That means purchasers of either console's physical edition are required to download approximately 85GB of data to play the game.

<p>
Images of Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920542970668826913">show an "internet required" badge on the cover</a>, but the extent of the required download size seemingly isn't made clear. Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda for confirmation of the reports, and for clarity on its physical release strategy, but the publisher is yet to respond. We'll update the story if we hear more.
</p>
<p>
The news follows similar criticism by players and preservationists earlier this year after Bethesda released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with just 20GB of the game's full 120GB install size on the disc. Nintendo has also seen pushback after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">announcing physical game-key cards for Switch 2</a> that only include a download key. Early signs have suggested a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">significant majority of third-party publishers will release their Switch 2 titles on game-key cards at launch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Away from Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release controversy, Bethesda's latest has received plenty of praise. Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan called it "brisk and playful" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">four star review</a>, while Digital Foundry described it as "phenomenal" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-series-x-delivers-the-smoothest-experience-ps5-pro-the-crispest-image">their tech breakdown</a>.

This port could be released before the end of 2025, and this is one of the reasons the Liberty City Preservation Project, which recreated the entirety of the Grand Theft Auto IV main city in GTA V, was taken down, alongside other unspecified existing reasons.</p>
<p>The fourth entry in the popular open-world series may not be the only now-classic game developed by Rockstar Games that could be released on modern systems in the future. According to Tez2, if Rockstar Games continues to follow its older plans, a modern port of Max Payne 3 could follow the Grand Theft Auto IV port, giving Take-Two the opportunity to release a bundle or Definitive Edition coinciding with the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> in the works by Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to Tez, the long anticipated GTAIV port appears to be in-development for current-gen consoles per his source.</p>
<p>He believes Max Payne 3 will follow after. <a href="https://t.co/jpKrpiK1Fo">pic.twitter.com/jpKrpiK1Fo</a></p>
<p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1921889318588567785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the past, we have heard multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-remastered-2023/">Grand Theft Auto IV would return to modern consoles</a>, but neither ports nor remasters have materialized, so we have to take what Tez2 revealed with a grain of salt. Given how Grand Theft Auto VI has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">delayed to May 2026</a>, however, Rockstar Games and Take-Two now have a window of opportunity to still give fans of the series something that could tide them over until the launch of the next entry in the franchise. Hopefully, this port will receive better treatment than the disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition collection.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-review-bomb-shut-down-thomas-mahler<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thomas Mahler, the head of&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Blind Forest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>developer Moon Studios, has claimed that the latter being "review bombed" could mean his studio will "have to shut down".</p>

<p>Speaking on the official&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>Discord (via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ori-and-the-blind-forest-studio-head-says-they-might-shut-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Mahler says that players who are enjoying the game should leave a positive review, because if they don't, a "review bomb" could lead "to people not buying the game", which in turn would mean Moon Studios is "not making any money".</p>

<p>The review bomb in question appears to refer to negative reviews on&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>'s Steam page, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abo-Ibrahim/recommended/1371980/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of which</a> point to the developer's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020099492/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anti-"woke" political positions</a>. Mahler says that if players want to see&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>finished, it's "detrimental" (sic; I assume he means "essential") that the review score be improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-bomb-shut-down-combat.jpg?itok=PQ6-5lPN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-bomb-shut-down-combat.jpg?itok=J49w9fIj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>head Thomas Mahler says a negative review bomb could, in theory, cause his studio to "shut down".</figcaption></figure><p>I have to say, though, that combing through the most recent "helpful" negative reviews seems to throw up just as many legitimate criticisms of the game's mechanics. Perhaps ironically, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_geoff/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> negative <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ARC_Paramore/recommended/1371980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews</a> even mention Mahler's desire for positive reviews as motivating factors without mentioning anything political.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1921646282726138116" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">response</a>, Mahler says that in fact, "pretty much everyone" who's played&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>following recent hotfix patches was "extremely positive", and that the Discord post containing his comments was left up "to push back against some of the bullshit reviews".</p>

<p>Mahler goes on to say that while Moon Studios is "not in immediate financial danger", he should be "allowed to speak up" about issues within the industry that he finds "unbecoming", referring to apparent calls to review bomb&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>because "according to those folks, [Mahler is] a Nazi".</p>

<p>Per an official <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the CWA website, the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>Gamemakers Guild (OWGG) includes "game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance".</p>

<p>It's the latest union to be formed as part of the wider Activision Blizzard organization. Others include a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-blizzard-union" rel="nofollow">union of&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers</a>, which was Blizzard's first of its kind, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-activision-microsoft-labor-complaint" rel="nofollow">unionized group of employees</a> at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer (and Activision subsidiary) Raven Software.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>union's formation was "heartening" for the then-nascent OWGG. Fellow&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>staffer and OWGG organizer Foster Elmendorf says the effort to "organize [the gaming] industry for the better" is "long overdue".</p>

<p>The new union's formation is part of a wider movement across the industry, which has seen thousands of workers unionize at their various companies. Other unions formed across the industry include folks at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike" rel="nofollow">Bethesda parent ZeniMax</a>,&nbsp;<em>Evil West&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flying-wild-hog-unionizes" rel="nofollow">Flying Wild Hog</a>, and staffers at&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>dev <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-have-joined-union" rel="nofollow">Avalanche Studios</a>.</p>

<p>It's not limited to individual studios, either. Back in March, the US' first industry-wide union, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/united-videogame-workers-union-formed" rel="nofollow">United Videogame Workers Union</a>, was formed, and it's open for any industry employee to join.</p>

<p>When workers at Blizzard's Albany QA division <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-union-vote-approved-by-nlrb" rel="nofollow">voted to unionize</a>&nbsp;back in 2022, Activision Blizzard was accused of attempting to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union" rel="nofollow">stifle the union's formation</a>, with the company subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation" rel="nofollow">battling to delay the vote tabulation</a> for said union.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has also been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/union-files-nlrb-complaint-against-activision-blizzard-over-labor-law" rel="nofollow">National Labor Relations Board complaint</a>&nbsp;filed on behalf of the CWA back in 2021, with the complaint alleging violations of federal labor law on the company's part.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether this new&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>union proceeds smoothly or whether Blizzard decides it wants to try and stand in the way. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Our regular PC game round-up column underwent further mysterious ructions during my absence last week, when substitute news chief Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-happening-in-pc-games-this-week-the-maw-may-6-2025">introduced a list format with subheadings</a>. I can only assume he had been driven mad by terror of being eaten by the Maw. Regardless, I will trust his instincts and follow in his footsteps. Here’s what’s coming down the pipe this week.
</p>
<h2>Monday 12th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437570/Chambers/">Chambers</a> is a new Weird West shooter from some of the pustulating greymass behind Golden Light, a game of peerless ugliness. I can’t wait to see what they’ve done to the six-shooters.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 13th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804010/Labyrinth_Of_The_Demon_King/">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a> is a foetid first-person dungeon-crawler set in feudal Japan. Feels like a good pick if you’ve ever wished Onimusha were more like Silent Hill</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/490110/The_Precinct/">The Precinct</a> is a top-down 1980s urban sandbox in which you are a policeman fighting gangs. Splash of GTA, obviously, but it also reminds me of grizzly 1999 crime-battler Urban Chaos.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 14th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3404470/Animal_Spa/">Animal Spa</a> is a steamy resort for chibi critters that nestles at the bottom of your screen, so that you can watch them bathe while you're doing your tax returns. I don’t think this is going to boost my WPM, somehow.</li>
<h2>Thursday 15th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is "packed with gratifying and chunky violence, but restrictive combat, tedious exploration, and cinematic delusions make for a disappointing follow-up to Eternal", according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-review">review</a>. Shut up Nic, Doom Guy would never betray me</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stylish-roguelite-into-the-restless-ruins-channels-classic-warhammer-quests-dungeon-crawling">building dungeons as you explore them</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503770/House_of_Legacy/">House Of Legacy</a> is a colourful isometric strategy management game, loosely inspired by imperial China.</li>
<h2>Friday 16th May</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246470/Kulebra_and_the_Souls_of_Limbo/">Kulebra And The Souls Of Limbo</a> is a whimsical adventure game with a touch of stealth and action, inspired by Latin American myths. Your job is to help the shades of the dearly departed find closure.
</li>
</ul><p>

As regards broader editorial happenings: I’m working on some longer-form stuff about survival games and nihilism. Nic is in hot pursuit of a review game or two. He and James are also collaborating on some kind of words-based pub brawl involving Doom: The Dark Ages. Ollie, sheriff of guidestown, has countless plans afoot. I believe some of them involve <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. Graham is busy bossing everybody around and Jeremy has eloped to a strange kingdom called "Holiday".</p>
<p>I don't know what Brendy's doing this week because he was away during the morning meeting, though he did, at least, forewarn us in a Trello note of Take Two Interactive's latest financials on the 15th, which may include updates on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> delay. Perhaps he <em>has</em> been eaten by the Maw. That’d be our 12th victim this month, if so. I’m getting pretty sick of writing letters of condolence. Anyway, what are you up to this week?

                <p>PC is typically considered the go-to platform for strategy games, but in the case of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a>, XCOM creator Julian Gollop sees great possibility for the genre to expand on the new Nintendo console, thanks to Joy-Con 2s offering mouse-like controls. While we have seen several strategy games on console make use of a custom control scheme instead of the regular mouse and keyboard experience--Frostpunk 2 and Age of Empires 2: HD being prime examples here--fans of the genre typically prefer a more traditional approach to playing these games.</p><p>"I would never have guessed that as something they would add to the console, and it's a really interesting feature," Gollop said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-creator-of-xcom-has-high-hopes-for-switch-2s-mouse-joy-cons-and-strategy-games-mouse-control-rts-might-work-really-well-here/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>. "Interestingly enough, a traditional-style mouse control RTS might work really well here, and also you've got at least a reasonable number of Switches you can use to substitute keyboard commands. It could be quite interesting. That's probably something I would look forward to. That adaptation of the traditional mouse and keyboard RTS using the Switch 2 controllers might be pretty cool."</p>

            <p>Magic: the Gathering has detailed more of its Final Fantasy card collection, and a message from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> character designer Tetsuya Nomura may hint towards the third part of the remake series.</p>
<p>The card collection includes two of Final Fantasy 7 villain Sephiroth - "Fabled SOLDIER" and "One-Winged Angel" - which form a singular piece of art when combined. The first is Sephiroth in human form, the second is his evolved form as the final boss of the game.</p>
<p>"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card," wrote Nomura in a message on social media. "I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p>

<p>He then added: "There is also a reason that the design for Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p>
<p>It's this latter comment that's got fans speculating the new artwork on the card may be taken from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part Three.</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>The biggest difference from the original game is that this Safer Sephiroth has both of his arms, where the boss form has one arm and one wing. Still, this is likely our first look at what's to come in the third remake game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Magic: the Gathering set, each iteration of Cid from across the series will be present.</p>
<p>Cid is a recurring character who debuted in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ii">Final Fantasy 2</a> and has featured, in some form, in every game since, meaning the set will include 15 Cid, Timeless Artificer cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards will likely be widely used, as the cartridge formats available to developers and publishers are rather limited.</p>
<p>As reported by Necro Felipe on X, the recent leak from Arc System Works, which included an in-development build of Guilty Gear Stride and the reveal of a new unannounced game that will launch on the next-generation Nintendo system, confirmed that only three types of game formats are available - digital game only, 64 GB cartridge, and Game-Key Card format. As the only actual cartridge option is the 64GB one, this is likely why many of the games releasing during the system's launch window are doing so in Key Card format, and why the format will likely be widespread unless Nintendo starts offering more cartridge options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="pt">[Nintendo Switch 2]</p>
<p>Graças aos vazamentos da Arc System Works, encontrados apenas três tipos de formatos são exibidos para jogos em projeto para o Switch 2:</p>
<p>• [DL] Jogo digital apenas<br>
• [64GB] Cartucho com jogo completo<br>
• [POTION] Codinome para o formato Key Card</p>
<p>— 'Necro' Felipe #UnivNintendo (@necrolipe) <a href="https://twitter.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While new in name, the concept behind the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards is nothing new, as we have seen a lot of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S retail editions discs that don't include games, and require substantial downloads to play games, like the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-retail-requires-full-download/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. What makes this format interesting, other than the fact that they can be lent to other players as if they were a regular cartridge, is the fact that, judging from the Arc System Works leak, Game-Key cards will allow downloading of games even in regions that don't officially support the eShop.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

They story is loosely inspired by Tesfaye’s own career.</p><p>He confessed how, “Cinema has always, for me, it’s always kind of been my number one passion. I happen to sing and make music and it kind of felt like a little detour, a little cheat code to kind of get into this. I always wanted to make movies and I always wanted to make music with movies.” He added: “During that journey, you always kind of hear and see the DNA of cinema in my albums and my music videos, and my performances on my stage. It’s always just been a part of me.”</p><p>The star’s breakout acting role came in 2023 on HBO’s “The Idol,” which received mixed reviews and criticism for both the plot and his acting chops. That said, the pop mega star admitted that “The Idol” didn’t quite feel like it was his, whereas “Hurry Up Tomorrow” brought the joy back into filmmaking. “I’m like, ‘Yeah! I do want to do this…this is great,’ ” the star said with a relieved laugh.</p><p>Tesfaye’s decision to retire his stage name came during a time his voice began to fail him, describing the film as a “guiding light” to push him forward to the next step in his career. “It felt like I had nothing else to say,” the 35-year-old revealed. “I was on stage and it’s like, I’ve said everything I can say as this person. Now it’s time for me to take that next step.”</p><p>While Tesfaye’s breakout role may have left fans less than inspired, many are gearing up to see what’s next for him in this “intentionally mysterious” mind bending thriller, co-written by the music artist.</p><p>Since kicking off his career with acclaimed mixtape “House of Balloons,” Tesfaye has reportedly taken home a total of 176 awards out of 513 nominations including Grammy, Billboard, American Music, and MTV Awards. </p><p>“Hurry Up Tomorrow” is set to release in theaters May 16.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Thursday, May 8.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers</strong></em><em> for The Last of Us season 2, episode 5.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie’s descent into violence truly kicks off in this week’s episode of The Last of Us. The show’s fifth chapter sees her brutally assault Nora in the spore-infested basement of the WLF’s hospital base. It’s one of the game’s most recognisable scenes and remains similarly harrowing in HBO’s adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and three other key sequences from the original game were adapted for this episode. Here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seattle Day 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-guitar-1747046641492.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In both the game and the show Dina listens in on WLF radio chatter to work out the group’s location and patrol patterns. In the game, we see Dina explain all this to Ellie – in part because it helps establish the objectives of the upcoming level. In the show, Dina takes notes but there is no like-for-like conversation about what the WLF codes mean. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the theater, Ellie explores the auditorium and finds a guitar. It’s one of the more memorable scenes from the game – Ellie takes a seat in the front row and begins to play. In the show, Ellie instead sits on a stool up on the stage. Both versions play the opening of Pearl Jam’s Future Days, although Ellie in the game sings the first two lines – show Ellie sings just the first. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, Day 2 sees Ellie head out to Hillcrest. That section of the game is pretty much cut entirely from the show – there’s no hiding from dogs in overgrown houses – but we do get a version of the Seraphite mural that is seen shortly after Ellie leaves the theater. In the game, the “Feel Her Love” graffiti is on the back of a truck. In the show, a similar image is painted on a wall. The WLF have left dead Seraphites below it as some kind of ironic gesture. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stalkers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-stalker-1747046657037.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the episode, Ellie and Dina have a tense encounter with a group of Stalkers. While Ellie does come across Stalkers on Day 2 in the game, this scene isn’t a direct translation of that moment. For one, Dina is now with Ellie – in the game, Dina stays at the cinema. The location has also changed; Ellie was attacked in an office building in the game, where the show’s Stalker showdown takes place in a warehouse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More significantly, though, the show’s Stalkers behave in a very different manner to their game counterparts. In the game, Stalkers are cautious, almost skittish predators, and so this encounter is a tense game of cat-and-mouse as you try to spot where they are hiding. While the show has made suggestion that Stalkers are more intelligent than the more animalistic Runner variants, in this scene there’s little evidence of that. The Stalkers pretty much just charge – or, indeed, run – at Ellie and Dina, and attempt to break into the cage the duo have barricaded themselves inside of.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another change comes with the reintroduction of Jesse into this section of the story. In the game, towards the end of the Hillcrest section, Jesse emerges from the shadows to catch Ellie before she walks into a WLF patrol. In the show, Jesse turns up to help Ellie and Dina escape from the Stalkers. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Seraphites</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-seraphite-1747046680529.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of what players will remember of Hillcrest has been removed for the show’s version of events, memories of the game will very much be evoked by the group’s encounter with the Seraphites. The forest and foliage is very similar to Part 2’s environment, and the sequence in which a hanging man is killed by his Seraphite captors is very close to the events of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key difference here is in the people present. In the game, Ellie explores this area on her own, whereas in the show she is accompanied by Dina and Jesse. This directly impacts a key moment when a Seraphite fires a bow and arrow; in the game, the arrow strikes Ellie and she is forced to wrench it from her shoulder. In the show, it is Dina who is shot, the arrow hitting her leg. This forces the group to move on, carrying Dina to safety.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">St. Mary’s Hospital</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/last-of-us-ep-5-comp-ellie-1747046698648.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This episode's big, climactic event takes place in St. Mary’s Hospital. It's the sequence that most closely resembles the video game – a near 1:1 recreation of Nora's final minutes. Like the game, Ellie finds Nora in the WLF-occupied hospital and holds her at gunpoint, demanding to know where Abby is. Their exchange culminates in Nora saying that Joel got what he deserves, her wording in the show closely resembling the script of the game. She then makes a run for it, throwing a container of liquid at Ellie to momentarily stun her. That last detail is slightly different to the game, in which Nora just throws a steel tray that only catches Ellie off guard for a second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase through the hospital is similar to that in the game, although notably shorter and less game-y. Nora shouts for her allies to shoot and they do so from a balcony, replicating the gunfire that sparks around Ellie as you push her forward in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The chase finally ends in the same spore-filled corridor bathed in red light that we saw in the game. Nora, collapsed and breathing in fatal spores, finally realises who Ellie is. “You’re her,” she says in both versions of the story. In the show, Ellie then takes a single swing with a metal pipe and the show cuts to black. In the game, Nora’s death is much, much more violent - with the camera lingering on Ellie’s twisted face, she strikes Nora three times. While this shot isn’t used for the show, HBO does somewhat replicate it a minute earlier by holding the camera on Ellie’s face as she holds Nora at gunpoint. It’s not as viscerally powerful as the shot from the game, but you can see where the inspiration comes from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our spoiler-free season two review and our spoiler-filled review of the fifth episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-6s-new-look-wolf-hawkfield-has-more-than-a-whiff-of-ganondorf-about-him-and-impressive-muscle-jiggle-physics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has revealed another playable character for its upcoming new Virtua Fighter game: Wolf Hawkfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolf is a Canadian professional wrestler of Native American descent who debuted in the original Virtua Fighter game in 1993 and has appeared as a playable character in every installment in the series since. His inclusion in the upcoming new Virtua Fighter comes as no surprise, but what has raised eyebrows is his new look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Wolf looks a lot older than his previous versions, and, as many fans have pointed out, he also looks a bit like Ganondorf, the main villain from The Legend of Zelda games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega’s announcement video shows Wolf’s walk-out scene, which fans are joking offers more story than he’s ever had before in a Virtua Fighter game before. The announcer’s intro touches on Wolf’s dramatic return to the world of fighting after his “controversial retirement that shocked the world.” Perhaps this new Virtua Fighter will offer a proper, fleshed out story mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video lacks gameplay, but it does show just how detailed the character models are even now, seemingly years away from Virtua Fighter’s release. As Wolf walks out we see quite noticeable muscle jiggle physics at play. Clearly, Wolf has kept himself in good shape over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6, as it’s being called by fans in lieu of an official title, is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-fans-hope-the-new-game-comes-close-to-matching-this-incredible-in-engine-concept-video">Sega released what it called a “pre-development concept video” for Virtua Fighter 6</a>, but made clear it does not reflect how the upcoming fighting game will look and play when it eventually comes out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, shown during Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at CES 2025, features incredibly realistic and fluid animations for a fighting game. We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
