<figure data-uuid="ac61c31bd8847"><a title="Pokemon Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac61c31bd8847/pokemon-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations underway, fans are quite rightly curious about how Nintendo and The Pokémon Company might acknowledge the games that started it all.</p>
<p>Yes, without <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a> (and Green), there would be no Pokémon and no 30th anniversary celebrations. Almost 10 years ago for the 20th anniversary, classic Pokémon games were added to the 3DS eShop on 27th February 2016. Users could buy these à la carte, long before Nintendo started to lean on subscription models for its retro games, and it made for an appropriate way to acknowledge the important milestone.</p>
<p>A new, unsubstantiated rumour from known Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331">Riddler_Khu</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-may-be-returning-on-switch-2-for-30th-anniversary/">Vice Gaming</a>) suggests that Nintendo might be gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> on the Switch for the 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>It's not clear whether these might be available via Nintendo Switch online or as standalone purchases (or, indeed, whether it's even a remotely credible claim at all), but it would make for a substantial addition to the GBA catalogue. Certainly, it would convince many Switch Online subscribers to upgrade to the more expensive Expansion Pack tier.</p>
<p>Whether this claim from Riddler_Khu is credible or not (and history suggests that their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/rofbyn/is_khu_even_trustworthy_anymore/">trustworthiness is sketchy at best</a> these days), it's nevertheless inspired us to speculate on whether classic Pokémon games will make a return for the 30th anniversary. And if they will, in what form should they take?</p>
<p>So, let us know what you think, dear readers, by voting in the below polls and leaving a comment in the usual place.</p>

            <guid>1432591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the start of 2026, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> didn't just announce layoffs at one of its studios (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">which is how it started 2025</a>). It announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>,"</a> which included layoffs at multiple studios, the shuttering of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Ubisoft Halifax</a></strong>, the cancellation of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-still-in-development-after-ubisoft-major-reset/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, and significant changes to its operating structure, alongside some unpopular new policies like a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">return-to-office mandate</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The response to these changes has not exactly been positive, both internally within Ubisoft and externally across the industry. On the stock market, the announcement of the restructure saw the company's stock price drop <strong>34%</strong>, which officially saw Ubisoft lose <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/"><strong>95% of its value</strong> in just eight years.</a> When this restructuring was followed by the introduction of a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">voluntary redundancy program</a></strong> at Ubisoft's headquarters in Paris, which aimed to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong>, employees decided they had had enough.</p>



<p>French union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several employees at Ubisoft Paris, announced plans for an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">international strike</a></strong>, calling on Ubisoft employees at branches across the globe to walk out and strike on <strong>February 10, 11, </strong>and <strong>12.</strong> Yesterday, February 10, 2026, was the first day of the strike, and according to Solidaires Informatique (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>), <strong>at least 1,200 Ubisoft employees walked out yesterday to participate in the strike.</strong></p>



<p>Most of the striking employees came from within France, with some of the striking workers also coming from the Milan branch. It's a strong show of force from Ubisoft employees, who have been calling out the company's leadership, specifically chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, as the responsible party for the studio's woes.</p>







<p>Employees are still on strike today, and will be for the remainder of the week. This is also not the only demonstration that has already happened, as former staff from the now-shuttered Halifax branch held a rally last month in response to their studio getting suddenly shut down.</p>



<p>Solidaires Informatique already hosted a smaller strike last month that it called an "<em></em><em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions."</em> Solidaires Informatique representative, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, also added, "<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Arkheron</strong>, the interesting and ambitious blend between <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">Diablo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ai-first-pubg-publisher-krafton-reaches-all-time-high-2b-in-revenue/">PUBG</a>, </strong>and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-re-remastered-mod-new-version/">Dark Souls</a></strong> from <strong>Bonfire Studios</strong>, which we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkheron-is-an-ambitious-and-intriguing-mix-of-diablo-dark-souls-and-pubg/">got a look at last September</a>. It will have its first public playtest via the launch of a brand new demo arriving on <strong>February 20, 2026,</strong> just ahead of the first <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> of 2026, which will officially kick off three days later on February 23.</p>



<p>The news of the new demo also came along with a new trailer, where Bonfire Studios takes players through some of its plans for Arkheron as the team gets closer to launch, and some of the changes and updates players who've previously participated in the game's alpha playtest weekends will notice.</p>



<p>Introduced in the demo will be two new Eternal item sets that Bonfire will reveal just ahead of the demo's actual release, though with that also means two current sets players are already familiar with will be removed for the demo. They're not going away permanently; it's just a switch Bonfire is making for now, and since part of the fun in Arkheron is mixing and matching items and abilities to create more powerful characters, it's all part of Bonfire giving players as many options on how to play as possible.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Arkheron Returns for Next Fest and Closed Beta" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XWBE5yCbrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo also arrives with a new patch for the game, version <strong>0.16,</strong> which adds a new tutorial, regional server selections, environmental updates and the ability to go back through your recent teammates if you want to keep playing with someone you randomly met through the game.</p>



<p>Once the demo goes live on February 20, players will be able to jump in 24/7 until <strong>March 2, 2026,</strong> when the demo goes offline. If Arkheron strikes you as something you want to keep playing, however, Bonfire is hosting another <strong>closed beta</strong> to help the studio further refine the game ahead of launch. The closed beta will introduce a ranked mode and will be focused on ensuring the game's competitive progression is finely tuned.</p>



<p>You will need to be sent a key to access the closed beta, so if you're enjoying Arkheron during Steam Next Fest, make sure to sign up for the closed beta to potentially participate in it.</p>

<figcaption>The tutorial does a good job of guiding you through the basics and introducing you to the world. Your charming starter home certainly doesn't hurt, either!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Returning Home</h2><p>As is typical for the genre, <em>Starsand Island</em> starts by giving you the basics — character creation, a short story introduction, a small plot of land, and a serviceable tutorial. This game also maintains the tradition of a high amount of player freedom; once you've started, you have a lot of different ways to play.</p><p>A central aspect of <em>Starsand Island </em>is its profession system. There are five Professions in total — <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-crafting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d06320e2-d098-442b-862b-cc5a7b880f1f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-farming" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1aeb3b5b-3678-439b-8ff5-bcceb96f1b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">farming</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-fishing-guide-fish-list" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc294a1e-1a2d-4599-80fb-5ccdee4f307a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fishing</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-ranching" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33313204-45f2-4ad0-a830-46657fcf40b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ranching</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-exploration" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4f81fb0e-0351-4f4d-bfb6-86178e7ee5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">exploration</a> — and each of them has unique quest chains that allow you to advance deeper into their respective crafting trees.</p><blockquote><p>Starsand Island lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p></blockquote><p>Crafting, in particular, is essential to life on the island, and this is why the tutorial recommends that you work on it first. You'll need to use the workbenches and crafting materials you make with the crafting profession to create equipment for the other four professions at one point or another, unless you want to do things the slow way.</p><p>That's not to say the profession system is overly restrictive, mind. I started the quest chains for all five professions and played through them concurrently, bouncing back and forth based on my interests at the time. <em>Starsand Island </em>lets you decide exactly how you want to play and how fast you want to go through its content.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can farm as much or as little as you'd like, but it's labor intensive to do it at scale until you unlock better tools and get the materials to make them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Growing Your Farm</h2><p>Naturally, farming is a big part of a game like this. <em>Starsand Island</em> offers a fairly robust farming system with seasonal crops, fruit trees, and multiple ways to plant your favorite foods. The pacing with this particular profession, however, is a little bit unusual.</p><p>Any <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> veteran worth his salt will tell you that sprinklers are essential to farming at scale, and you can usually start to make them fairly early. Conversely, <em>Starsand Island</em> buries the required equipment about halfway through the farming and crafting professions, respectively; it takes quite some time to get there.</p><p>You'll need a fair amount of materials to make sprinklers, too, and that means a <em>lot</em> of runs into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-moonlit-forest-map-mining" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f6e5d31-1253-4ac8-93bf-3b367a1048ca" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the Moonlit Forest</a> to go mining for resources. Essentially, having the most basic of automation on your farm requires a fair amount of progress in three of the five professions.</p><p>Farming gets easier as you go, but it's not quite the cozy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-make-money-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="db0a0c64-2a9f-4840-bb10-50b7b8479970" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">moneymaker</a> that you'd expect from some other Farming RPGs. Sowing, watering, weeding, and harvesting crops are all done one at a time until you can progress deeper into multiple professions and craft yourself some better equipment.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Though it has its limitations, the building system lets you reach a level of detail better than you'd normally expect from a game like this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Building Your Homestead</h2><p>One of <em>Starsand Island's</em> most notable features is its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/starsand-island-building" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cfa93844-ef2b-4c84-a0d9-a024896405ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">building system</a>. Many games in the Farming RPG and survival genres allow you to build structures piece by piece, but <em>Starsand Island</em> gives you what I believe to be one of the most robust building systems ever seen in a game of this style.</p><p>You're automatically given a cozy one-room, Asian-style shack as your home. It has enough space for the basics, but you might want to expand if you want to avoid having dozens of crafting stations strewn about on your front lawn. This is where you have two choices: layouts and free building.</p><blockquote><p>In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p></blockquote><p>If desired, you can purchase a pre-made layout and simply plop it down on some empty land. There are a few choices of varying architectural styles, and you can additionally modify the design yourself once it's placed.</p><p>The much more attractive option (to me, at least) is the free building system. You can place blocks, roof pieces, doors, and windows piece by piece. You can scale them to larger sizes. You can change their texture. You can build yourself a simple grey box for your stuff, or you can spend hours building the perfect home.</p><p><em>Starsand Island</em> takes things even further with its decorations. In addition to the nearly one thousand furniture items you can unlock in the game, you can also place nearly every other item in the game as decoration, such as crops, cooked food, tools, and some (but not all) of the crafting materials you come across.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>None of the regular enemies or minibosses are particularly challenging; they soon turn into more of an annoyance than an actual challenge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Fighting Through the Forest</h2><p>Peaceful as it may seem, this beautiful island paradise is not free from conflict. The Moonlit Forest pulls double duty as both the main dungeon and the mines, and you're going to have to visit it a lot to get all of the raw materials you need to advance your professions and make useful equipment.</p><p>The Moonlit Forest is one of the weaker areas of <em>Starsand Island</em> in its current state. You can run end-to-end and encounter fewer than 10 enemies and a grand total of three minibosses. Combat doesn't feel particularly challenging, either.</p><p>Though lacking in enemies, the Moonlit Forest more than makes up for it with an abundant amount of unique plants, trees, and raw ore. These items spawn in the same place every day, and you'll likely find yourself visiting the same spots daily to collect another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-upgrade-your-backpack-in-starsand-island" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbf3814c-7ff0-4758-bfdd-6963d3b2ffe9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">backpack</a> full of iron or gold.</p><p>Mining in the Moonlit Forest was always one area where I never felt like I had enough time or energy. If I needed certain materials, I'd easily burn up half of my day slogging through the dungeon to get everything I need. This aspect of <em>Starsand Island</em> could do with some improvement in the future.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Forging Friendships</h2><p>The one element I haven't yet addressed in <em>Starsand Island</em> is the friendship system.

<h2><em>Starsand Island</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>All in all, <em>Starsand Island</em> is definitely one of the better Early Access Farming RPGs that I've played in recent years. The few bugs I've encountered have been relatively small, and many of them were fixed in the course of my time with a pre-launch version of the game.</p><p>While it's currently a little weak on the story and combat aspects, <em>Starsand Island</em> is mechanically robust, engaging, and — most importantly — fun. The building system is especially entertaining to me, and I struggled to resist the urge to spend countless hours building out the island home of my dreams.</p><p>As always, the main concerns with an Early Access game are how fast it can squash bugs and deliver new content. As important as this is, what you'll get with the Early Access launch version is an estimated 100 hours of gameplay. I'd wager you'd get even more than that if you take your time to enjoy it.</p><p>I'm excited to see how <em>Starsand Island</em> grows and develops in the coming months. If you're a fan of Farming RPGs and life sims (or if you're even remotely interested in these genres), then I can confidently say that <em>Starsand Island</em> is the first must-play game of the year in this space. Give it a chance — you won't be disappointed.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Starsand Island</strong></em> was previewed over approximately 85 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Czech indie developers Amanita Design – creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/samorost">Samorost</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creaks">Creaks</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/machinarium">Machinarium</a>, among other marvels – have released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4109130/Phonopolis_Demo/">a demo for Phonopolis</a>, their 3D cardboard adventure about a young man called Felix who is trying to save a city brainwashed by massive loudspeakers. Protected by his headphones, Felix is on a mission to stop the authoritarian Leader from issuing the Absolute Tone, which will “strip every citizen of their humanity forever”. Seems like a thing to avoid!</p>
<p>I relate intensely to Felix at the moment, because I’m having trouble with my lugholes and can barely hear anything. Thank to the magic of medicinal drops, I, too, am proof against sonic mind control, but also, I am feeling more than usually susceptible to assassination. A marching band could backstab me right now. It’s not clear from the Steam page whether Felix’s indispensable headphones leave him similarly vulnerable. I guess we’ll have to play the demo to find out.</p>
<p>“With Felix becoming immune to the commands, you’ll be able to take advantage of the loudspeakers and use them to solve puzzles involving other characters,” the developers explain. “Other times, you will interact with the cardboard environment in surprising, often unexpected ways—turn walls, shuffle floors, control various machinery or tear paper curtains. Each puzzle is carefully integrated into the world and presents a different challenge.” </p>
<p>Those cardboard sets – all based on physical, hand-painted sets, with animations capping out at 12 FPS in mimicry of stop-motion film – certainly do look very inviting. But hang on, what’s this? Felix can “take advantage” of the very same loudspeakers that have subjugated his fellow citizens? The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house, Amanita!</p><p>Being an Amanita joint, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phonopolis">Phonopolis</a> is openly steeped in art history. “The art style is strongly influenced by avant-garde artistic trends of the interwar period such as constructivism, futurism, and suprematism, and their societal impact as a tool of propaganda,” the Steam page goes on.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of isms, more than is generally advisable, but I trust them to stick the landing. There’s also a sentence about the soundtrack, but I can offer no further comment there because, as of writing, you could set fire to a sackful of lions in my vicinity and I’d be none the wiser. Do your worst, *checks TV Tropes*... Jesse Custers of the world! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206070/Phonopolis/">The full version</a> of Phonopolis releases sometime this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>For the first time in years, I had a full five-stack in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. Friends who had dropped Blizzard’s hero shooter years before and hadn’t given the game so much as a glance were finally back after the company </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>added five new heroes</span></a><span>, restructured its seasonal rollout to incorporate story, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropped that pesky </span><i><span>2</span></i></a> <span>from the title. They weren’t the only ones, either. </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#1y"><span>reached a new all-time peak on Steam</span></a><span> last night with over 165,000 concurrent players logging in on the launcher. Not bad considering it was, at one point, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-overwatch-2-patch-notes-season-6-battle-pass-1850729064"><span>one of the lowest-reviewed games on the platform</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>That said, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is a multiplatform game, and a lot of PC players use Battle.net anyway, so that’s only a small slice of the people who flooded the servers yesterday. I actually had to wait in a queue for probably the first time since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch in 2022. But once I got in, I immediately queued up as my longtime mains while everyone else was trying out the new heroes like a hydrogen bomb descending upon a coughing baby. I kid, mostly. I did put in a fair bit of time as Mizuki, the new support who throws his not-magic hat around the field to heal his teammates. Thankfully, the first night wasn’t </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>mirror matches of the five new heroes the whole time, as a lot of people just logged on to play as their main for a few matches.</span></p>

 <p><span>But in the midst of all those matches, my friends who had long been skeptics of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s return in a post-PvE cancelation world were hootin’, hollerin’, and admitting that the game “might be good” again. To which I say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><span>I told you so</span></a><span>. I’m glad to see so many people coming back and seeing how Blizzard managed to salvage a game after years of mismanagement and corporate sabotage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, we’re probably in a honeymoon phase. The new heroes have injected a bunch of chaos into the mix, and viral clips of ridiculous plays with the tether-sporting Jetpack Cat are spreading like wildfire. When the dust settles, we’ll probably talk about hero balance again, and Blizzard may rein in some of these antics, but it feels good to see </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>so reinvigorated all at once. This isn’t solely a result of the influx of new playable heroes, but also of the fact that Blizzard is pretty committed to its story integration. We’ve gotten what feel like weekly lore updates, and even gotten another audio drama starring Freja and newcomer Emre that is actually feeding into the internal push and pull between Vendetta and those who have been part of the terrorist organization Talon.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fans have been discovering new layers to characters’ relationships through both the lore drops and the new dialogue before matches. There’s a lot of interpersonal drama with actual momentum now, with characters talking to each other about the state of the world after Vendetta defeated Doomfist, and maps like Watchpoint Gibraltar and Colesseo changing things in the environment and layout as part of the current narrative.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the best character stuff is, unsurprisingly given the theme of the season, coming from the characters who have defected from Talon. Sombra, Reaper, and Widowmaker are on the run after Vendetta’s hostile takeover, and dialogue implies that they’re all part of a tenuous partnership without the Talon banner uniting them.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Widowmaker and Sombra interaction!</p> <p>"Not like I didn't warn the boss, but hard to believe Vendetta is starting a war." <a href="https://t.co/i4O5BjkXqz">pic.twitter.com/i4O5BjkXqz</a></p> <p>— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/2021456512238092617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the most devastating subplots revealed in the game’s dialogue is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-hero-is-sigma-an-astrophysicist-who-doe-1836605852"><span>Sigma’s</span></a><span>. The mad scientist character has been conspicuously absent from the season’s cinematic, comic, and audio dramas, but he is also a member of Talon. However, it sounds like Vendetta views him more as a danger to be held captive, and he misses his friend Sombra, who had to cut and run. If Sigma kills Sombra in a match, he utters a devastated </span><a href="https://x.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021460992421658892"><span>“But I still need you,”</span></a><span> or solemnly wonders where his friend has gone. That shit hurts real good. The </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>website has updated several of its heroes’ story blurbs and </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes/sombra/"><span>confirms that Sombra is “keeping a careful eye” on Talon</span></a><span> while Sigma is imprisoned, so maybe a jailbreak is in order later down the season?</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So remember how Sigma kinda got no mentions during the setup for this new season besides a new lore blurb today? Turns out…he is not happy <a href="https://twitter.com/OW2voicelines?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OW2voicelines</a> </p> <p>RELEASE MY GOAT! RELEASE HIM <a href="https://t.co/iJB0hhFz5C">pic.twitter.com/iJB0hhFz5C</a></p> <p>— Jetpack Uniwatch (@UniwatchOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021413869986644446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s not all angst, though. The slew of new hero interactions is giving fans a lot to work with in terms of understanding new, budding relationships. Where once </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>said shipping </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-shipping"><span>wasn’t a priority</span></a><span> in its worldbuilding, there are a bunch of characters with romantic tension in 2026, and that rocks, actually. Lifeweaver and Baptiste feel like they blazed a trail for heroes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ptr-lifeweaver-season-4-baptiste-new-hero-1850300708"><span>to start flirting</span></a><span> in pre-matches, and now that the story actually has momentum, maybe ships like Wuyang and Juno or Kiriko and Mizuki can go somewhere. We’re already getting a lot of Freja and Emre, who seem to be canonically ex-lovers, so let’s spread the love, Blizzard. Except for Soldier: 76, who will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-month-parade-soldier-76-vincent-skin-1851785385"><span>likely remain a yearner</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BYE MILKYWAVE IS REAL, I TOLLDDD U BRUH I TOLLDD UUUU <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/milkywave?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#milkywave</a> <a href="https://t.co/DTF7gppUNV">pic.twitter.com/DTF7gppUNV</a></p> <p>— korti 🍪 (@PPYCH0W) <a href="https://twitter.com/PPYCH0W/status/2021391556033294756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Overall, it’s kind of wild to feel like there’s reason to hope for </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> again. The PvE campaign didn’t pan out, but the game we have feels more focused and dedicated to delivering a story with momentum, an ever-evolving competitive game with new heroes shaking things up every season, and in-game events to keep people showing up all year. It feels like we’re back in 2016 when the possibilities seemed endless. Here’s hoping Blizzard makes the most of this fresh start.</span></p>

              <p>Poor&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after having a pretty smooth run from launch until the end of 2025, has since started springing leaks faster than developers Embark Studios can plug them up. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-permanent-bans-cheaters-stream-sniping-2000660615">cheating scandals</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-dup-glitch-hotfix-patch-1-15-2000667320">item-duplication glitches</a> that have been pissing off its player base, it now seems the latest update has introduced both a weapon-repairing glitch and a way to make infinite ammo. And worse, they’re both incredibly easy to pull off.</p> <p>Usually when we see reports of a new way of glitching something in an online game, it turns out to be an action so complicated that only the most elite and dedicated players would ever even try. Unfortunately, that’s very much not the case in the latest issues to plague the excellent extraction shooter. It’s as simple and clicking back and forth in your inventory, then dropping and picking up weapons. And that means everyone’ll be doing it.</p>

 <p>Brought to wide attention by X user @genos, both the weapon-fixing and ammo-generating glitches use much the same technique. If you have a couple of worn weapons and want them repaired, all you need to do is rapidly switch them between your two weapon slots and for some reason their numbers start to climb. To make this stick, you then need to drop the weapon on the floor and pick it up again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW REPAIR GLITCH IN ARC RAIDERS. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <a href="https://t.co/GCKXkAXL3K">pic.twitter.com/GCKXkAXL3K</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021383166955786342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weapons wear down in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in order to prevent players from being able to overly rely on a particularly expensive, particularly powerful choice, which would reduce the sense of danger when on a raid. It’s a crucial part of the game’s already shaky balance, as much as it might annoy a player in the moment. As such, being able to fix up the most costly, most dangerous guns means people are able to become significantly overpowered, stepping over systems designed to keep things in check.</p>

 <p>This is then made worse by the accompanying glitch, where those constantly top-notch weapons also need never run out of bullets to fire. Again, the top-tier arms have very scarce, expensive ammo, designed to restrict use and prevent domination. But by swapping weapons over, not only do they get repaired, but they’ll also fill an ammo slot. Do this, drop the weapon, pick it up, unload it, drop the ammo and pick that up again, and it’s yours to keep. And yes, this is much more cumbersome, and hardly useful for a rapid-fire automatic weapon, but when it comes to something like a Hullcracker with its super-rare explosive projectiles, it’s a huge issue. And it gets far worse.</p>

(There <em>is</em> unofficial trading in-game, where you can swap out items with people you encounter, and this can be exploited for ill gains, but it’s not going to cause major harm.) The issue is far more about an individual player’s progress being artificially boosted, with them able to sell ammo to in-game traders for extra cash, and especially for PVP players getting far better equipped when battling other people.</p>

 <p>I imagine we’ll see an emergency hotfix rolled out pretty sharpish, but in the meantime, perhaps focus on the freshly released <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">Shared Watch event</a> where players are encouraged to work together to fight the machines. And remember, the game’s matchmaking deliberately assigns you to games with players of a similar temperament, so if you’re PVP-averse, you’re far more likely to be put into lobbies with raiders of a similar nature.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of Pokémon Pokopia has revealed how many hours players would spend in the game and that experiences await after the end credits. </p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-announced-for-2026-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the Switch 2 during the Pokémon Presents showcase last year. Since then, we have received the March 4 release date for the title and a new trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-trailer-reveals-new-pikachu-snorlax-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Pikachu and Snorlax variants</a>. Also, a leak has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed the theory</a> about Pokémon Pokopia taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.Now, the developers have finally revealed some new information about the upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-pokopia-will-be-about-20-40-hours-long">Pokémon Pokopia Will be About 20-40 Hours Long</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://in.ign.com/pokemon-pokopia/252940/news/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-dire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Pokémon Pokopia director Takuto Edagawa discussed the gameplay hours for the upcoming title and the experiences after the end credits. Edagawa explained that the title’s motive is “typically not to go to the end roll [credits].” The concept is to craft a world where you can spend your time with Pokémon. </p>



<p>However, on average, the title is expected to take 20 to 40 hours, though it really depends on how players approach it. Players will have “more things to experience after the end roll [credits].” The director believes players will be encouraged and motivated to keep playing the game after the end credits. Do you want more content, or does 20 to 40 hours seem enough? </p>







<p>In other news, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return has been teased</a> by a leaker. Additionally, the developers have revealed how players on the original Nintendo Switch can join the fun, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but there’s a catch</a>.

Meanwhile, Krafton is planning to keep veterans and newcomers alike busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> ports of the two previous games.</p>
<p>The surprise news dropped today, 11th February, with the press release announcing we won't even have to wait a full week for the free upgrades to both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Below Zero</a>; they're coming on 17th February.

<p>On Switch 2, Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero are getting "visual and performance upgrades" in the form of 1440p resolution for docked play and 1080p while going handheld; across both modes, the games will run at 60 frames per second. Hopefully, the performance will be consistent and not variable. While generally slow-paced, the Subnautica games are first-person, and their underwater environments can be confusing to fully navigate at times. Under those circumstances, having 60 FPS is a godsend.</p>
<p>There's also talk of "optimized controls" for the Joy-Con 2 controllers that enable "more precise movement, smoother exploration, and refined interaction" with the game worlds, though specifics haven't been shared. We also have to assume the price tags for fresh purchases won't be altered since the updates are completely free.</p><p>Past drama with publisher Krafton aside, developer Unknown Worlds remains at the helm of the Subnautica IP and buzz surrounding the full-blown sequel is still loud, so if you need new oceanic sci-fi adventures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">make sure to keep tabs on it</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/876355/reanimal-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam</link>
            <guid>1432501</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The woods in <em>Reanimal</em> are full of surprises. You will encounter human cadavers that slither like snakes, gigantic talking pigs, and, at one point, a forlorn, supersized whale who seems resigned to an agonizingly slow death. These variously monstrous beings inhabit a realm that, though it looks like our own, seems to defy spatial logic: the forest leads to an oceanic expanse, which segues into a decrepit, towering city. It’s like Aesop’s Fables meets the nightmare visions of both Lars von Trier and J.G. Ballard.</p><p>Playing as a boy and girl (either solo or via local / online co-op), <em>Reanimal</em> evolves the premise Tarsier Studios explored with its first two <em>Little Nightmares</em> games: the timeless terror of children being pursued by larger, looming monsters. But the camera in this action-platformer is more fluid and dynamic. It feels less like you are peering inside a doll’s house and more like you are seamlessly directing these characters through a miniature film set. Another notable departure: For all its unsettling darkness, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15468396/little-nightmares-horror-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Little Nightmares </em>always carried a little storybook charm</a>. That quality is largely absent here. <em>Reanimal </em>is darker, nastier — and stronger for it.</p><p>The game begins on water, with you following dimly lit buoys; you reach a beach and open washed-up suitcases to find a key. From there, you venture into what seems like a hydroelectric facility. Inside, there are light puzzles to solve as you move forward, though nothing so taxing as to impede your progress for very long. The pair you’re controlling (referred to simply as “Boy” and “Girl”) can jump and grab objects; later, they wield a crowbar, useful for prying open doors or whacking smaller enemies. If you have played either a <em>Little Nightmares</em> game or a title by Playdead (the Danish studio’s landmark first game <em>Limbo</em> or 2016 classic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a>), then the action will feel instantly familiar.</p><p>The revelatory moments arrive via finely crafted details: These child protagonists carefully and reassuringly usher one another into each newly discovered room. I love how upon each restart after dying (perhaps in the jaws of a monstrous foe or by tumbling down a sheer drop), the duo are shown hugging one another — the only comfort they have in this terrible world.</p><p>Yet these children are made of steely stuff. For every panicked sequence fleeing a gigantic sheep down a blood-red corridor, there is a moment when it is these youngsters who are doing the chasing. <em>Reanimal</em>, like forebears dating all the way back to 1991’s <em>Another World</em>, delights in showing you enemy figures loping ominously off-screen through some crack or hole in the wall. You must follow, plucking up the courage to trail these beasts into inky shadows.</p><p><em>Reanimal </em>takes some time revealing where its strikingly macabre, exquisitely haunted images are leading. The key moment occurs with the arrival of a soldier wearing a Brodie helmet popular in World War I; a few scenes later, you discover coastal artillery. Tarsier toyed with wartime motifs in its <em>Little Nightmares</em> games, notably the pile of shoes that recalled the heaps of belongings found by Allied soldiers at Nazi extermination camps in West Germany. <em>Reanimal</em>’s allegory is more explicit: At one particularly gruesome moment, you must evade the shots of a sniper stationed high in a building. Fail to find cover quickly enough and the young boy or girl’s body is ripped apart by a speeding bullet.</p><p>Tarsier’s latest operates in a different tonal zone to the jingoistic, popcorn warfare of the <em>Call of Duty</em> series and the amped-up-to-11 absurdity of <em>Battlefield</em>. Its solemnity evokes the trench sequences from the first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> game and finely calibrated dread of 2024’s underrated survival-horror title <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1286990%2FCONSCRIPT_Directors_Cut%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Conscript</em></a> and action-adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Hell Is Us</em></a>.</p><p>That said, for all <em>Reanimal</em>’s achievements, it falls just a little short of greatness. The game doesn’t possess the same crystalline, airtight polish of Playdead’s work. Some transitions between scenes are a little abrupt, and on a few occasions, I had to reload because of a glitching character. Such is the literal darkness of the game, coupled with the choices of perspective, that distinguishing between the fore and background is a struggle; cue the odd accidental fall.</p><p>None of this greatly impacts what is a frequently bold and brilliant game. Since 2017, Tarsier has made children’s nightmares for grown-ups; despite its young protagonists, <em>Reanimal</em> is a nightmare wholly born from the anxieties of adults. It seems to speak to both the horrors of the 20th century and our barbarous present in which large-scale on-the-ground conflicts between sovereign nations have regretfully reemerged.</p><p>I’m still running the story’s deeper meaning through my head. But regardless of the conclusions I eventually draw, there is no denying the sheer verve and power of the images that Tarsier summons on screen. Bodies — human or otherwise — disappear into bodies; children are doomed to wield the weapons of grown-ups (if they are not torn asunder by them first). The game also harbors a fascination with the spectacle of popular entertainment, delivering showstopping moments in both a cinema and theater.</p><p><em>Reanimal</em> does not flinch; this action-platformer delivers a parade of atrocities you cannot take your eyes off of.</p><p><sub>Reanimal <em>launches February 13th on the PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/876355/reanimal-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

<p>NetEase has praised AI integration across the full game development and gameplay innovation cycle in their latest earnings release. </p>



<p>For those unaware, it was claimed around a week ago by Grasshopper Manufacture’s founder that NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t allow any of their internal studios use AI</a>. However, NetEase was quick to debunk the claim, stating that “the situation described did not occur”. Now, the company has revealed its stance on AI, and it seems to be loving it. </p>



<h2 id="h-netease-has-comprehensively-integrated-ai-across-full-game-development">NetEase has Comprehensively Integrated AI Across Full Game Development</h2>



<p>In the operational highlights section of its <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings release</a>, NetEase announced that it successfully achieved comprehensive integration of AI across the entire game development and gameplay innovation cycle. This integration encompasses art, design, programming, animation, and quality assurance. It enables high-volume, scalable production and facilitates the smooth implementation of dynamic, AI-native gameplay features across several flagship titles.</p>



<p>The CEO and director of NetEase, William Ding, stated that AI has become the “foundational competency for our development and operations,” significantly improving production efficiency and creating new interactive experiences. The developer’s future plans are to foster a creative talent ecosystem, deepen collaboration with partners worldwide, and thoughtfully advance AI-application capabilities.” </p>



<p><strong>Check out William Ding’s full statement below: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“We concluded 2025 with another healthy quarter, reflecting the durability of our long-term game operations and the growing impact of our global titles. </em></p>



<p><em>AI has become a foundational competency for our development and operations. We have been systematically applying AI throughout game development and gameplay, where it is already driving meaningful improvement in production efficiency and unlocking new interactive experiences for our players that were previously out of reach.</em></p>



<p><em>Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering exceptional experiences across the&nbsp;NetEase family of businesses. By fostering a creative talent ecosystem, deepening collaboration with partners worldwide and thoughtfully advancing our AI-application capabilities, we aim to further extend the longevity of our franchises while continuing to deliver innovative experiences to create even greater value for our global players and shareholders alike.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking about the games and related value-added services numbers, the net revenue for this category was RMB27.5 billion (US$3.9 billion), a 3.0% increase compared to the same quarter in 2024. </p>

Additionally, Divinity devs have stated that they will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrain from using GenAI tools</a>” for concept art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“I want a really human experience, right? I don't want a computer-driven creation.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty safe to say that generative artificial intelligence has become a divisive issue within the games industry and wider player community. As the technology becomes more prevalent, companies and studios are being pushed to offer clarity on their use of it. Within the past few months alone, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-will-hold-fan-qa-about-dev-processes-following-ai-backlash-and-says-it-will-make-changes-to-processes-that-fail-to-align-with-who-we-are"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian has faced significant backlash against its use of generative AI</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-developer-jagex-insists-no-generative-ai-will-ever-be-present-in-any-asset-that-a-player-can-touch-hear-or-feel"><u>RuneScape studio Jagex has promised no AI will be used for any assets a player can “touch, hear or feel.”</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM, the developer behind Disco Elysium and the upcoming Zero Parades: For Dead Spies, has offered its view on the issue, and it’s a pretty simple one: “No AI.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking to IGN, ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, offered his perspective on the situation: “I think about the world right now, where everybody's dealing with AI in a creative space, and what I see is there'll be a hunger for this singer-songwriter in a cafe. I want a really human experience, right? I don't want a computer-driven creation.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we'll see more of that,” he continued. “There's always this desire for storytelling and something created by humans that has meaning, that you can relate to. And so I think there'll be a resurgence in that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When pushed to clarify the studio’s stance on the technology, Murray gave a simple statement. “No AI,” he said. “As a stance, we don't use it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM, added, “It's all just us being messy and human all the way through. And if it's embarrassing, and if it's not as polished as it would be if you went and used AI or whatever, that's fine. Because all we really care about is just being ourselves, basically.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can feel it when you play our games,” continued Ashilevi. “You can see and feel the fingerprints of real human beings when you exist in those worlds and when you read the stories that we like to tell. I think there's a certain rugged and kind of unpolished quality to the kinds of stories and worlds we like to create.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) were not particularly prevalent during the development of Disco Elysium, but during the creation of Zero Parades they have risen to become a major force in the world of tech. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/google-ai-project-genie-allows-you-to-create-playable-worlds-from-prompts-so-of-course-its-been-used-to-rip-off-nintendo-games-like-mario-and-zelda"><u>Google’s new “Project Genie” AI tech has demonstrated a (very limited) ability to create playable worlds based on simple prompts</u></a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-patents-system-to-generate-ai-podcasts-in-the-voices-of-your-favorite-playstation-characters"><u>Sony has patented AI systems that create podcasts hosted by PlayStation characters</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-patents-ai-assist-feature-that-can-take-over-if-you-get-stuck"><u>an assist function that can help players overcome challenges in video games</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">To me, and I’m sure many others, the Pokémon franchise as a whole has always been “cozy.” Set in a (mostly) idyllic world with cute best friends who are always by your side, how could it not give you warm fuzzy feelings at least occasionally? We’ve had some relaxing Pokémon games over the years, but we’ve never quite had a game that embraced this secondary cozy aesthetic fully into its gameplay–until now, with Pokémon Pokopia. I played the first hour of Pokémon’s first life-sim, and the sheer amount of discovery to be made hooked me. I also played Pokémon Pokopia in multiplayer mode in a more developed world, plus, I learned more straight from the developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Pokopia begins with a Ditto waking up after a long, undefined slumber. It remembers its trainer in its hometown, with the nameless narrator commenting, “You look so happy with your trainer petting you!” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aw, that is <em>so</em> sweet, and <em>so</em> sad–Ditto’s trainer is nowhere to be found, and that’s Ditto’s–(you, the protagonist’s)–motivator. In a bid to try to find its trainer, Ditto transforms into a human that looks like its trainer the best they can. Enter the character creator, in which you get to choose between seven hairstyles, 28 haircolors, hats, clothes, and bags. No, you can’t just be purple, that wouldn’t be very human-like! </p><p>“I wanted to create something where you can directly communicate with Pokémon,” Ohmori said.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shigeru Ohmori, the primary director of Pokémon games since 2014 and Pokémon Pokopia’s Concept and Senior Director, explained the thought behind making a Pokémon the main character and why it transforms into a human. “I wanted to create something where you can directly communicate with Pokémon,” Ohmori said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ohmori worried if they had a trainer as the playable character, as in the other mainline titles, it becomes the trainer giving orders to Pokémon, which they wanted to avoid. By keeping it all Pokémon, an atmosphere of friendship and teamwork is created. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons Ohmori decided to make specifically Ditto the main character, too: one to benefit the gameplay, and another to benefit the story. Because Ditto can transform into other Pokémon and use their moves, it was the best option (I argue Mew could fit that bill too, but of course Mew wouldn’t have those adorable “simple eyes and slack mouth,” as Professor Tangrowth puts it.) </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Pokopia Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other reason feeds the narrative motivations of Pokémon Pokopia. No one else knows what Ditto’s trainer looks like, so Ditto transforming into the trainer it misses is essentially asking the other Pokémon, “Do you know this human being?” Again, so cute, so melancholic, and I love it.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3">An Unobtrusive Tutorial</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The tutorial, fortunately, is nicely integrated into what would be the regular flow of gameplay, and lets you start doing stuff outside its confines very quickly.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After meeting Professor Tangrowth, I found the Pokedex, and then found my first–then second–then third–Pokémon friend, expanding my abilities and how I could affect the world with each one, further enhancing my ability to create a wider variety of habitats to attract a wider variety of Pokémon. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Pokopia Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bulbasaur taught me the move Leafage, allowing me to create tall grass at will. Squirtle taught me the move Water Gun, so I could revitalize the dry ground and grass in the aptly named Withered Wasteland, the environment you start in.  Charmander didn’t teach me a move, but instead taught me that you can ask Pokémon to follow you somewhere so they can perform an action based on their Specialty. In Charmander’s case, they lit a fire for me. As for other Specialty examples, Tiburr’s Build helps you build structures, and Bulbasaur’s Grow, makes plants grow faster.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, to find more Pokémon, you need to make a variety of Habitats. The most basic habitat is four squares of tall grass, easily made by Leafage. You can also move objects around with Ditto’s ability to store and then spit-up materials, like, a Punching Bag. This is, canonically, the move Stockpile. Holding the collect button down actually makes Ditto continuously suck up anything around it, causing its face to hilariously and disturbingly resemble The Scream painting. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-3-en-1770755284956.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other habitats include ones like the self-described “Boulder-shaded tall grass,” which attracts Fighting-type Pokémon like Timburr and Machop, and “Hydrated flower bed,” made of four flower beds placed beside–you guessed it–water. After a bit of time passes, a square in your new habitat may shake, indicating there’s a Pokémon there to meet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Pokedex for tracking Pokémon, there’s a Habitat dex for tracking habitats, and there are quite a number to discover! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I loved just experimenting, it isn’t all completely guess work. Occasionally, you’ll find a sparkle on the ground that’s a “trace of Pokémon” which gives you a hint about a yet-to-be-found Pokémon’s preferred habitat you haven’t discovered yet. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Core Loop - All Pokemon All the Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This cycle of attracting new Pokémon, learning new skills oivr discovering new specialties from them, then making more new habitats to attract even more new Pokémon, is the corest-of-core loops in Pokémon Pokopia, and is already incredibly engaging and fun without even considering the crafting and world customization you can do. This isn’t an accident.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-4-en-1770755316881.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“When thinking about development of the game, [the team] started thinking about the cycles of the user's motivation,” said Takuto Edagawa of KOEITECMO GAMES, Pokémon Pokopia Chief Director.  “What the user wants to do, what they would want to start to do within the cycle. So, for example, filling up the Pokedex or creating more habitats, then that would create meeting more Pokémon.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Every single step in the game,” Edagawa continued,  “The core of it is to be with the Pokémon, communicating with Pokémon. So wherever you go, there is always Pokémon… that is the largest difference compared to other [life sim] games.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-2-en-1770755332684.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This core cycle that focuses on the Pokémon first and foremost is ingrained into the “main objectives” that propel the story as well. Just after meeting the Kanto Starters, you discover a decrepit Pokémon Center nearby. The PC there automatically launches the Poke Life Environment Improvement App, which dishes out both important tasks tied to progression, like increasing an area’s Environment Level or rebuilding the Pokemon Center; and smaller daily objectives, like collecting a certain number of sturdy sticks. </p><p>Bulbasaur specifically asked for a bed, so I crafted a Straw Bed from leaves for&nbsp;them.&nbsp;<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stick collecting is self-explanatory, but to increase the Environment Level of the area, you must attract more Pokémon and improve their Comfort Levels. Again, another touch point with Pokémon. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-1-en-1770755348273.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing furniture a Pokémon wants within the bounds of its habitat–which you can see by pressing in on the R-stick–will increase its Comfort Level. Bulbasaur, for example, specifically asked for a bed, so I crafted a Straw Bed from leaves for them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Poke Life app rewarded me for my efforts with new unlocks and Life Coins. These can be used to buy a variety of things at the PC, like furniture, seeds, Pokémon hints, building recipes, and more. After increasing the Environment Level, Professor Tangrowth had more for me, too. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Multiplayer and More</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There seems to be a lot more to Pokopia than everything I already talked about. I haven’t even touched on building buildings or what looks to be a huge number of collectibles–like Human Records, which included things like a diary that gave a glimpse of what Professor Tangrowth’s life was like with their human, and a document on Pokémon Greetings that taught me an emote! </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-10-en-1770755363492.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The four-player multiplayer session gave me a look at a developed world, where Pokémon’s Habitat’s were developed so thoroughly they lived inside houses! The inside of the houses had furniture and decorations, like plushies, and the little town was manicured with sidewalks, fences, lamp posts, and even a stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with multiplayer was short, and I’m restricted from what exactly I can reveal, so I can’t say much more about it besides that it was fun. I can see friends ushering each other to stay on task, because it is just so easy to get distracted in Pokémon Pokopia, and that sounds like the best kind of hectic. (I was that friend in my group. I’m sorry!) </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/pokmon-pokopia-media-preview-screenshot-7-en-1770755377935.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Edagawa said that, on average, depending on how you play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">Pokémon Pokopia, it will take between 20 and 40 hours to reach the “end” credits</a>. But, that’s not really the main motivation to play Pokémon Pokopia–it’s to make a world to live with Pokémon. As for the post game, “There’s more things to experience after the end credits… I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game,” Edagawa said. </p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be motivation for players to log in intermittently. Pokémon Pokopia Producer  Kanako Murata of The Pokemon Company said “When you play day-by-day, there may be something that, on a specific day, something special that might happen in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering how many hours some friends of mine have put into Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I think they’re right, especially for those whose motivations are to create a unique place to live with Pokémon. For me, I hope Ditto and the crew learn what happened to create this apocalyptic, empty world, but regardless, I’m excited to restore it with my best Pokémon friends.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's upcoming Dragon Quest Builders-like sandbox, Pokopia, isn't just a Pokémon-themed block-building playground. It has a main story that some are suggesting has some post-apocalyptic vibes to it, and according to the game's director, it can take anywhere from 20 to 40 hours to finish... with more to do after the credits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from our own interview with Takuto Edagawa, the chief director of Pokémon Pokopia. We asked about the approximate length of the game, and this was the response:</p><blockquote>So for this game, the main motivation for this game is typically not to go to the end roll [credits]. The whole concept is to create the world with Pokemon and live with the Pokemon. However, as an average, it'll be about 20 to 40 hours, but it would really depend on how the players play the game.</blockquote><blockquote>There's more things to experience after the end roll [credits]. So it depends on what you mean by contents, but I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This fairly open-ended response isn't a surprise given what we know of Pokopia. It's a sandboxy sim where you, a Ditto transformed into a human shape, hang out on an initially deserted island and get to work building habitats to convince more Pokemon friends to come live with you. It's very similar to Dragon Quest Builders, which makes sense as the developer, Omega Force, also helped out on Dragon Quest Builders 2. In addition to the story component, we can imagine this will have some fairly open-ended gameplay as to what you build, where, and how, and its multiplayer components will likely give the game some longevity too. As a result, it makes sense that players would have a wide range of completion times based on how much they dig into the building mechanics both during and after the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also got a chance to go <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-the-final-preview">hands-on with Pokopia, including its four-player multiplayer offering</a>, and experience its cozy, mysterious world for ourselves. The game is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-confirmed">planned for release</a> on Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5, 2026.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Joy Toy, a popular figurine production company, has announced a line of small-scale Starcraft models as part of a collaboration with Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joytoy.com/blog/detail/we-officially-launch-the-starcraft%E2%80%94small-scale-action-figure-collaboration">In a blog post to the official Joy Toy website</a>, the company announced it'll be making models for the Zerg, Protos, and Terran. Exactly what those models are remains a mystery for now, as they're silhouetted in the announcement post. Details on product information and pre-order schedules are set to come in the future via Joy Toy channels.</p>
<p>These figurines will be a compact size of roughly 10cm, with seemingly five available split across the three playable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> factions.</p>
<p>While it is worth noting that this post explicitly states these models are "based on the characters from the classic game, StarCraft," the announcement does come at an interesting time for Blizzard and the StarCraft IP.</p>
<p>Not only is 2026 a milestone year for Blizzard, with multiple big announcements teased for Blizzcon later this year, but rumours are circulating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-reportedly-partnering-with-nexon-to-revive-starcraft">around a new StarCraft game in-development at Arc Raiders publisher Nexon</a>. If these reports are accurate, this game's development would coincide with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-squashes-hearthstone-2-supicions">big shifts at Hearthstone (though not Hearthstone 2)</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-expansion-brings-players-surging-back">a massive Overwatch resurgence</a>.</p><p>It is, of course, also possible that these figurines are just a nice nostalgic way to show your love for the original StarCraft, and that nothing is going on with StarCraft as the IP remains dormant. It's totally possible. Place your bets, folks!</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal</link>
            <guid>1432441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161942/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re a horror fan and you own a Switch 2, you should play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. From the moment it pulls you into its bleak, nightmarish world, it’s clear that developer Tarsier Studios is building on everything it learned from the <strong>Little Nightmares</strong> series while pushing its signature horror sensibilities to unnerving new heights.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious evolution of the cinematic horror puzzle-platformer formula the studio helped define with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>, one that plays out less linearly in larger 3D spaces, with more varied combat and traversal mechanics and bombastic set pieces. It does so with impeccable sound design, gorgeous lighting, and pitch-perfect atmosphere.</p>
<p>Reanimal marks a shift from the Tim Burton-esque macabre of the studio’s earlier titles towards what, by the end, feels closer to the shell-shocked horror of Elem Klimov’s war film <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/">Come and See</a></strong>, infused with the profane supernatural. Its moments of pulse-pounding escalation overwhelm the senses, while quieter stretches seethe with tension and fear of the unknown.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161946/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are small points of friction along the way, whether in busier encounters that can briefly disorient or in lengthy load times that occasionally interrupt the otherwise seamless flow. Even so, these are minor frustrations in a game that so consistently delivers on its vision, and they do little to dull the impact of its world, atmosphere, or stellar set-piece design.</p>
<p>Narratively, you play as a brother and sister venturing through a hellish world in an effort to rescue their missing friends, a simple setup that effectively supports the game’s focus on co-operative survival. There is well-executed voice acting that elevates certain moments and sheds light on the predicament facing the characters, though instances of it are sparse.</p>
<p>Reanimal is fully playable in single-player, which pairs you with an AI companion, but it supports local and online co-op with GameShare, too. The game frequently requires its protagonists to act in tandem – flipping switches simultaneously or coordinating actions to progress – and both playable characters function identically, with no mechanical advantage given to either.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161937/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My review is primarily based on my time playing solo, and the companion AI generally keeps pace, responds reliably to prompts, and does a solid job supporting the game’s more demanding sequences, particularly during chases and combat. Rare moments of awkward AI behaviour self-resolved and were typically tied to puzzle conditions not yet being met.</p>
<p>Compared to the playable protagonists of Little Nightmares, who often feel almost doll-like – underpowered, limited in their movement, and unable to reach the height of door knobs – the characters in Reanimal are larger and more mechanically capable, while the core loop of escaping a hostile space by cleverly eluding and besting an area’s apex threat remains intact.</p>
<p>While Little Nightmares is built around a side-scrolling progression, Reanimal’s environments are far more intricate and non-linear, requiring exploration and backtracking to find the tools needed to overcome obstacles. There are traversal mechanics through the use of a boat and other vehicles, though it’s best to avoid detailing them here to prevent spoilers.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161936/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game also includes light melee combat, primarily against enemies of your own size, with the companion AI mirroring the player’s actions, attacking in tandem or raising a light source to illuminate the surrounding darkness. The game’s lighting and colour palette is genuinely gorgeous, yet it’s frequently unafraid to plunge you into pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p>Given just how dark the lighting can be at times, it’s worth noting that a small white indicator appears when you get close to objects like hatches and levers that can be interacted with, as well as cracks in walls you can squeeze through, which feels like thoughtful environmental design that guides the player without being intrusive or breaking immersion.</p>
<p>That said, it’s still possible to overlook smaller items, such as a key on the floor or a tool required for a puzzle amidst a cluttered space, which can briefly stall progression until they’re discovered. These objects are marked by a subtle white outline when approached, but spotting them can occasionally require visual skimming of the environment.</p>
<p>There are a variety of well-hidden collectables scattered throughout, including masks that your characters can wear, which are typically tucked away behind easy-to-miss hidden rooms. Reanimal’s relentlessly grim world is also dotted with flyers pinned to walls, which unlock concept art and offer an additional incentive to explore off the beaten path.</p>

<p>The game’s audio design also stands out, especially when played with headphones. Ominous bellows, grinding factory machinery, creaky floorboards, howling wind through open spaces, blaring car alarms, and a barrage of abrasive noises sharply heighten the stress and tension, especially as you’re tailed by no shortage of horrid things during chase sequences.</p>
<p>A recurring frustration I had with Tarsier’s previous game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_ii">Little Nightmares II</a>, was the use of encounters that leaned too heavily into trial and error and instant deaths, often requiring repeated attempts to progress. Attempting a section over and over broke my immersion and diminished the scare factor. Reanimal does a better job of minimising such friction.</p>
<p>There are a few moments where repetition is difficult to avoid simply because it’s easy to misunderstand what the game is asking of you, such as when player characters are forced to traverse a crumbling multi-forked path while tied together. But arguably the game’s biggest fault is that it can sometimes take more than 15 seconds to reload after you die.</p>
<p>You can complete Reanimal within four to five hours, but there’s no padding. While the first act perhaps too closely resembles Little Nightmares, from the design of its antagonist to the rhythm of its environmental puzzling, Reanimal steadily sets itself apart visually and narratively as it progresses, while gameplay becomes far more varied and ambitious.</p>

<p>The game’s final act culminates in a genuinely thrilling spectacle that leaves behind layers of lore for diehard players to unpack. By the time the credits roll, everything the game has been building towards comes together in a way that feels greater than the sum of its parts. It marks Tarsier Studios’ best work to date and a confident evolution of their creative vision.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Reanimal, Tarsier Studios delivers its darkest, boldest work yet. Expanding on the Little Nightmares formula with non-linear exploration, striking audiovisual design, and bombastic set pieces, this is an imaginative horror experience that confidently delivers its vision while offering accessible co-op play that fans of the developer have long clamoured for.</p></section>

			<p><strong>MercurySteam</strong>, the developer behind the critically acclaimed 2D action game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-dread-hunting-for-more/">Metroid Dread</a></strong>, followed up its beloved <strong>Nintendo-exclusive</strong> outing with something completely different last year. <strong>Blades of Fire</strong> was a new 3D action-adventure game that saw you take the role of <strong>Aran de Lira</strong>, the last blacksmith capable of wielding and forging true steel, who is tasked with killing the Queen to save humanity.</p>



<p>When it launched in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, and despite it lacking in originality with its fantasy setting and narrative, he praised the weapon variety and forging mechanics, giving it an <strong>8.5/10</strong>. A crucial point on its launch, however, was that it was only available on PC as an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-gm-admits-steam-wont-be-toppled/">Epic Game Store</a></strong> exclusive. Now, developer MercurySteam has announced that it is finally making its arrival on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2091020/Blades_of_Fire/">Steam</a></strong>, and it'll do so with a new and improved <strong>"<em>Version 2.0</em></strong>."</p>



<p>It'll arrive on Steam on <strong>May 14, 2026,</strong> and if you're keen to get your hands on it before then, you'll be to play a demo that's live <strong>right now</strong> to help celebrate its Steam release and to participate in <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong>, which is due to officially start in two weeks at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>As for what's new in Version 2.0, players will be able to dig into a new difficulty level called "<em>Titanium</em>" to really test their forging and fighting skills. Element transmutation has been added to allow players to change material types. There's a new photo mode, new game plus (which also includes new weapon parts and skins only available in NG+), and a new boss revival mode that lets you replay boss fights. Crucially, you can also now pet the Ox.</p>



<p>Outside of new gameplay additions, Version 2.0 also includes several technical updates and improvements, including adding support for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-sea-of-remnants-and-vampires-bloodlord-rising-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-with-multi-frame-generation/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a>,</strong> support for Steam Deck, new achievements and full key remapping for keyboard and mouse controls. The Steam version will also come with the game's original soundtrack and an artbook as part of the <strong>Adventure Pack</strong>, though anyone who owns the game on the Epic Games Store or consoles will have to grab the Adventure Pack separately.</p>
