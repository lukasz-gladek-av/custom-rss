<p>The thing is, this all got a bit too much to handle for Larian. Speaking in an interview with EDGE magazine (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Faaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936449%2Fedge-magazine-subscription.thtml&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-120&amp;xuuid=0ad38a56c8611bae7d8f9493083ecd87&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #400</a>), CEO Swen Vincke explained that the sheer amount of ceremonies they needed to attend caused a workflow disruption:</p>
<p><em>It affects development - there's a lot of them. This has been a real problem. We had to rotate teams so that different people went to different award shows. It would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time because it is surprisingly draining on the soul.</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, Larian has nearly moved on from Baldur's Gate 3 after <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refusing to create a sequel or even DLCs</a>. The team has decided to leave the Forgotten Realms behind and create something entirely new. They have two original projects on the way, and they've just <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> a new office in Warsaw, Poland, to grow even further.</p>
<p>However, they are still working on a final update to add the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-closed-alpha-starts-today-with-beta-in-july-and-release-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official modding tools</a> (the Alpha started last month, while the Beta is expected later this month) in September. As per the community's request, the evil endings will also be improved.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov-%E2%80%98arms-race%E2%80%99-event-kicks-off-a-battle-between-traders.928224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-arms-race-event-guide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games has just released a new event in Escape from Tarkov named ‘Arms Race’. At the heart of this new event is a battle between two of the game’s traders: Prapor and Peacekeeper. Multiple quests are wrapped up in the Arms Race event, with players first being tasked with killing Scavs in Factory and procuring their weapons. As highlighted by Mechanic, another trader, Prapor and Peacekeeper are gearing up for an epic fight, and being the opportunist he is, he wants players to grab the weapons these two traders have given to the AI-powered Scavs that roam the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-tarkov-s-arms-race-all-about">What’s Tarkov’s Arms Race All About?</h2>



<p>It begins with ‘Import Control’, which we’ve broken down above. To complete that, you’ll need to hand over five FIR ‘Western’ Scav weapons to Mechanic <strong>as well as </strong>eliminating 10 Scavs on Factory. That’s a relatively run-of-the-mill challenge.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll get ‘What’s Your Evidence’ pop up. To complete this mission, simply obtain 10 ‘Western’ Scav weapons that have low durability, handing them to Peacekeeper to investigate. Here’s the list of calibers you’ll need to be looking out for:</p>



<ul>
<li>.300 Blackout</li>



<li>.357 Magnum</li>



<li>.338 Lapua Magum</li>



<li>.45 ACP</li>



<li>4.6x30mm HK</li>



<li>5.7x28mm FN</li>



<li>5.56x45mm NATO</li>



<li>6.8x51mm</li>



<li>7.62x51mm NATO</li>



<li>9x19mm Parabellum</li>
</ul>



<p>To best achieve this, head to a map that spawns plenty of Scavs, like Customs, and kill everything that moves. To hit the target, you’ll need weapons with less than 10 durability.</p>



<p>Then, ‘Caught Red-Handed’ will pop, inviting you to place cameras around Lighthouse for Peacekeeper as he attempts to figure out what’s happening with his weapon shipments. You can get the cameras from Mechanic at LL1.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got your cameras, you’ll need to head to the entrance to each water treatment plant building on Lighthouse, planting the cameras tactically to watch the area. Be warned: you’re almost guaranteed to clash with other players, Rogues, and perhaps even the Goons or Zryachiy as you make your way to these objective points.</p>



<p>Presently, this is as far as we’ve got with the challenges. There are a lot of rewards to be scooped up for completing these tasks, though – including a stack of XP that will boost lower-level players an immense amount. Furthermore, it seems as though there’s a ‘pick-a-side’ mechanic lined up, which will assumedly see players fight for either Prapor or Peacekeeper. BSG has confirmed that the ‘winning team’ will get an exclusive reward along with a one-time, limited-edition achievement.</p>



<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>



<p>There’s currently a bug – or what’s <em>believed to be a bug </em>– that’s causing players to lose rep with Prapor and Skier every time they enter a raid, even if they’re playing as a Scav character. This is hitting players across PvE and PvP platforms, and presently, it’s impactful enough that it’s causing players to lose trader levels. </p>



<p>This is a huge issue for PvE players, as one of the core mechanics of <strong>that </strong>mode is persistence – they’re not subjected to regular wipes like PvP players are. So, if they never wipe, these rep hits will have a longer lasting impact.</p>



<p>We’ll update this as more is learned about this event.</p>

Prime subscribers can get the <strong>limited-edition atomic purple version of Elgato’s Stream Deck MK. 2</strong> for $124.99 ($35 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Atomic-Purple-Limited/dp/B0D2J98G3K?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>.</p><p>Normally, the standard Stream Deck MK. 2 comes in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Atomic-Purple-Limited/dp/B09738CV2G?tag=theverge02-20">black</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Atomic-Purple-Limited/dp/B09RMXK59C?tag=theverge02-20">white</a> and sells for $149.99 (or discounted as low as $109.99 during its biggest sales promos), so there is a bit of a premium on the limited-edition model and its aesthetics. But this is the first (and possibly only) time the atomic purple model has been discounted. Elgato only sells this variant on Amazon, and it claims the individually numbered run will no longer be available once it sells out. So you may want to consider jumping on this if you love the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">resurgence of transparent tech</a>.

Bewls. Pipers. Gleebs. These aren't the mutterings of a lunatic, but rather a mere handful of creatures you'll be able to charm and collect in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next title from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilmot's Warehouse</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> I Am Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Hollow Ponds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a chill adventure about exploring a wondrous world atop a giant bird (or maybe you're just very small?). On your travels, you'll have the chance to discover and nurture a flock of creatures that will trail in your wake, swirling and chirping in all the colors of the rainbow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, we spoke with the dev team to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/a-naturalistic-world-for-flying-sausages-the-evolving-design-of-flock">learn how they designed Flock's naturalistic world</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Now, to commemorate the title launching on July 16 (wait—that's today!), we caught up with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ricky Haggett and programmer Mike Robinson to find out how the team implemented </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, well, flocks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="We'll all float on">We'll all float on</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett explains camera positioning was key to cultivating a certain feng shui. When players are careening across glades and weaving between ferns like a sentient Concorde, the flock will drop backwards so it doesn't obstruct the camera's line of sight. When they're engaging in more serene activities, such as attempting to woo another critter into their menagerie, they'll congregate nearby without a care in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, there was definitely a thing where the camera was always in amongst the flock," he says. "It felt cool but also broke that feeling of zipping around. I think we have a sweet spot now where you still get these nice moments of being amongst them, but only for a fleeting moment before they drop back."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Robinson notes flocks generally follow a few key rules that determine how they congeal. He says each gaggle of creatures follows a spline that trails the player-controlled bird. When they stop, that spline "meanders off" and creates a metaphorical holding pen before latching back onto players when they decide it's time to hit the proverbial gas. The code and logic that determines how creatures position themselves was designed to ensure performance wouldn't be "too much of a worry."</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-rXtCyX-NA?si=3eKg35dZOrIjjsZP" height="450px" width="100%" data-testid="iframe"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He notes it all started by implementing a point cloud of base positions that was stretched out around the spline trailing the bird. "The beasts aren't really aware of what's going on and what's nearby, but then we do things like when you're flying close to stuff that can contract in, or when you swing out and do a big curve, the points that are travelling past that curve get pushed to the side slightly," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"None of the creatures are aware of the speeds they're travelling at or any of that other stuff. It's just kind of mapping them to this spline than pushing them out based on the extremities of curves and other values."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As players explore the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Flock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they'll be able to unearth new creatures and win their affections—hopefully convincing them to join their giddy gaggle of gliders. That collect-em-up mechanic required Hollow Ponds to not just consider how each flock should move, but how new creatures should slot into established herds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the moment, [newer] creatures will travel to the front," says Robinson. "Some of the key creatures will want to head to the front of the flock to get more exposure. But we also ended up going through and checking all the sizes of each beast in the flock, and we asked whether it was worth ensuring each [creature type] had specific area?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The trouble with flying sausages">The trouble with flying sausages</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer was 'no.' The team felt positioning had already reached a "nice point" that didn't demand an extra layer of complexity on top. Haggett acknowledges that creatures (which come in all shapes and sizes) can still sometimes clip into each other, but the nature of player movement means it goes largely unnoticed. In fact, the biggest challenge Hollow Ponds encountered when fine-tuning flocks was sorting out the long bois (not their official name).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Most of the creatures bend using material stuff," says Robinson. "It's just a fairly cheap material solution that doesn't involve updating skeletons. Haggett quickly chips in here to explain bending largely involved moving the vertices at render time based on curve values. The issue is that solution looked awful when applied to the longer, more sausage-like creatures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We ended up using the spline mesh tech, and then bolting on a skeletal mesh for the head at the front [of longer creatures," says Robinson. "It was about making sure those curves come out nice and mapped to where you want them to be, basically. It's just a two-point spline, and we didn't want to split them into multiples because that could be a higher CPU cost."</span></p><p>Flock concept art showing an array of creatures</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, those longer creatures—which are actually called Pipers—had separate head meshes and two or three body meshes. Robinson, however, put a lot of work into mapping a two-point spline to ensure pipers only needed one body mesh. "I just put a lot of time into working out how to map this two-point spline so I could get it to travel through four points by adjusting the tangents," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Haggett says that was a pretty big win because it's not "phenomenally expensive" in terms of performance. "You could make a skeleton with a bunch of points, and then you can deform the mesh around that skeleton. But that's so expensive—especially if you imagine the nature of this game," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You can have 30 of those things [flocking around you]. You can have four players, and so then you can have 120 of those things all flying around together on a low spec console. It's just not going to work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preventing players from welcoming more than 30 creatures into their flock was partly in service of stability, but Haggett says it was also something of a goldilocks number that looked *just right* on-screen. "There was an optimization thing happening, but as you start playing the game for real and start collecting things and putting them in a flock, there's a meaningful number of things you can put in your flock and actually care about," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's your shelf of cool stuff, is what your flock is—and there's a reason why as you make that number bigger it doesn't necessarily feel better. Also, just visually, the feeling of flying around with 30 creatures wasn't that different to the feeling of flying around with 50 creatures.

            <p>I’m calling it now. When, in <a href="https://x.com/LordsManor/status/1812908811222413585">a “few weeks”</a> according to the developer, fishing ponds come to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> builder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a>, it will take approximately 45 minutes for some enterprising medieval fintech tinkerer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-dev-wants-you-to-decide-whether-the-game-should-allow-egg-monopolies">utterly bork the entire economy</a>, and it will be glorious. What will begin as brave new world of lean protein and previously unseen Omega 3 levels will soon devolve into hordes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">beleaguered oxen</a> hauling overburdened carts full of rotting fish carcasses, as hyperinflation looms.</p>

<p>I have beheld the idyllic lake, as shared by Greg ‘Slavic Magic’ Styczeń on Twizzler, and I see only financial ruin rippling upon its tranquil surface, like a really fucked up lillypad.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Ok, so it’ll probably be fine. As you may have heard recently, updating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> for the sake of it goes against both Styczeń and publisher Hooded Horse’s vision for the game. Not every game needs to be "some live-service boom or bust," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">said Hoody Horsey’s CEO Tim Bender recently</a>, after the game was criticised by Long Dark studio Hinterlands CEO Raphael van Lierop for a lack of updates. We can safely surmise that Styczeń has deeply considered the impact of throwing fish at his game’s serfs, then.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed how shiny the above lake looks, too, which is likely down to the upcoming engine change slated to also arrive in the upcoming patch. The migration to Unreal Engine 5, hopes Styczeń, will sort out some lingering memory corruption issues, like flickering roads and crashes, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/manor-lords-creator-is-sorry-about-bugs-leftover-from-the-city-builders-latest-patch-but-promises-the-move-to-unreal-engine-5-will-sort-out-other-annoying-issues/">Games Radar</a>.</p>
<p>The initial hype around Manor Lords - that wot led it to sell 2 million copies - has understandably leveled out a bit, but it’s undeniably heartening to hear that Slavic Magic aren’t under pressure to crank out new mecha-ox or hay-based battle passes. “Dev uses early access to work on game at their own pace and player base plays a bit here and there, then and moves on to other games when they’ve had their fill” shouldn’t be an unusual state of affairs in anything but a profoundly sick industry, but them's the no-brakes, I guess.</p>
<p>"Sustainability is something we think about a lot," Bender <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">told our Edwin</a> a few months back, "but usually we think about it in relation to developers. So we're in an interesting situation - we never took money from, like, venture capitalists, or private equity, or international conglomerates, or anything that would put pressure on us. In fact, we even wrote into our bylaws that we can prioritise other things over profits, like artistic integrity and fair treatment.”</p>

SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P Wireless is down to just $119.99 in the sale, a significant 33% drop from its $179.99 list price. I love this headset, and personally use it at home during every multiplayer session on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, or just when chatting over Discord. </p><p>It features a fabulous out-of-the-box audio setup and an extremely generous battery life which is good for lazy gamers like myself. With top tier audio quality and comfort without an eye-watering price tag, this is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset">best wireless gaming headset</a> to buy during the Prime Day sales. It got a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steelseries-arctis-nova-7-review">9/10 IGN,</a> with reviewer Matt Adler stating: "Simultaneous Bluetooth audio, improved battery life, and a lighter design make the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 the midrange headset to beat."</p><div><div id="198088" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P Wireless Gaming Headset</h3></p></div><div id="203975" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>SteelSeries Arctis 7P+ Wireless Gaming Headset</h3></p></div><div id="203984" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset</h3></p></div></div><h2>Racing Wheel for PS5 Prime Day Deals</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-racing-wheels-for-ps5">best racing wheels for PS5</a> put you right in the driver's seat for games like Gran Turismo 7 and F1 24. Sure, a PS5 controller gets the job done, but there's nothing like the exhilarating rumble of a racing wheel to make you feel like you're tearing up the track.

I know, it's disapointting, especially when we've seen a reasonable offer on the controllers pretty consistently during the Prime Day sales over the past few years. But, that doesn't mean there isn't anything to discuss. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Dd5VR?object_uuid=55dcb871-8227-43c4-b496-fbafbc642527&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Backbone One Mobile Gaming Controller is down to $69.99</a> for Prime Day. That's a $30 discount for Prime members, and well worth considering if you want to play PS5 games handheld via streaming but don't want to shell out for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/MVmvq?object_uuid=55dcb871-8227-43c4-b496-fbafbc642527&amp;t=article" target="_blank">PlayStation Portal</a>.</p><div id="203973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>BACKBONE One Mobile Gaming Controller for Android and iPhone 15 Series (USB-C) - PlayStation Edition</h3></p></div><h2>Is it Better to Buy a New Console on Prime Day or Black Friday?</h2><p>Prime Day often lacks the punchy console deals that we often see during long <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> sales. For example, last year saw the launch of the PS5 Slim which Sony quickly bundled with Spider-Man 2 or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and knocked $50 off the list price. </p><p>That was the most popular deal of Black Friday, and a good indicator that it's worth waiting on a decent console deal. It's also worth keeping in mind potential mid-gen refreshes like the PS5 Pro, which could usher in bundle deals or price drops for every other PS5 when it launches. There's lots to consider, but for now I think it's safe to say it's better waiting for Black Friday to buy a console.</p><h2>Should You Wait For the PS5 Pro?</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro</a> feels like it's been officially announced, but in reality it's currently heavily rumored. Earlier this year nalysts reported to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/ps5-pro-sony-to-release-refreshed-playstation-5-in-2024-analysts-say.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CNBC</u></a> it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>anticipated Sony will release a ‘Pro’ variant of the PS5 in the latter half of 2024</u></a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a> also reported that the PS5 Pro is “aiming for<strong> a tentative holiday 2024 release</strong>.” So should you wait for the PS5 Pro before buying anything? </p><p>If you're waiting on buying a PS5 console in general, possibly; if you're willing to spend a rumored ~$600 on a video game console. Otherwise, the standard PS5 will do you just fine and all of the deals we've mentioned in this article will work for both iterations of the console, so there's no need to wait for the next mid-gen refresh. Should you wait for the PS6? Also no.</p><h2>What are Must-Have Accessories for the PS5?</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-accessories">PS5 has a slew of interesting accessory options</a>, but the must-haves are dependant on your playstyle. If you're a single player guru who sticks to 200 hour Elden Ring playthroughs, then it's unlikely you want a top of the line gaming headset for comms on Warzone. But, if multiplayer is more your vibe, then by all means shell out $100+ for the best headset possible. Personally, an SSD is <em>the </em>must-have accessory for PS5, as it'll relieve so must stress and time in the longrun, especially with how big games are getting. Otherwise, my next best suggestion is a premium controller like the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro or DualSense Edge, but only if they're on sale.</p><h2><strong>What Is Amazon Prime Day?</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024"><u>Prime Day</u></a> is a great opportunity to save some serious cash on your favorite hobbies, at least in my view. The annual summer sale features discounts on thousands of items, with new lightning deals every hour that you won't want to miss.</p><p>As one of the biggest sales events outside of Black Friday, it attracts many companies, including those outside of Amazon, offering exclusive discounts available only on Prime Day. If you're already a Prime member, you can access the sale without much bother. But, there's also a<a href="https://zdcs.link/jox2p?object_uuid=55dcb871-8227-43c4-b496-fbafbc642527&amp;t=article" target="_blank"> <u>free 30-day trial</u></a> if you're intrigued and just want to check out some of the new discounts.</p><p>Prime Day is absolutely one of the best times to<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games"> <u>buy physical video games</u></a> and although you might not find discounts on major consoles during the sale, there are still plenty of deals to check out for Switch, PS5, and Xbox. </p><p>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

            <p>We’re still a few months out from the bug-be-gone-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>’s September 9th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-blinked-and-almost-missed-warhammer-40k-spare-marine-2s-release-date">release date</a>, but that hasn’t stopped a jolly band of heretics skirting the watchful gaze of the inquisition and pirating what appears to be a leaked version of the entire game. The 75GB torrent is apparently fully playable minus a few assets, and also includes server binaries, meaning cool pirates can play with their cool pirate mates.</p>

I won’t repeat it here, because pirates aren’t cool and don’t have any mates.</p>
<p>The build itself seems to originate from June 20th, 2024, according to Insider Gaming. As mentioned, it’s supposed to be mostly complete, minus a few menu placeholder assets. Space Marine 2 went gold on July 9th.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive recently cancelled a planned public beta to work on polishing their power armour and, I dunno, oiling their chainswords before launch. Does one oil a chainsword? Is the blood of the emperor's foes sufficient lubrication? Trick question, of course. There’s only one emperor, and he rides a big griffon instead of lounging around on a throne all day like an opulent wastrel.</p>
<p>Back in May, Saber detailed the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-space-marine-2-will-let-you-go-head-to-head-in-pvp-multiplayer">PVP multiplayer</a>. Waayyy back in April, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch reckoned in public that $70 games were doomed to go <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-titles-are-doomed-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-says-saber-interactive-ceo">“the way of the dodo”</a> due to not being sustainable. Saber themselves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">escaped</a> the Embrace(r) of Death back in March, taking studios such as 3D Realms, Slipgate Ironworks, and New World Interactive with them.</p>

			<p>For better or worse, Gacha games are taking over a large portion of the free-to-play market, and a brand new title called Neverness to Everness has just been announced.</p>
<p>The developer is Hotta Studio, the Perfect World subsidiary that released <a href="https://wccftech.com/tower-of-fantasy-release-today-bugs-shortcomings-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tower of Fantasy</a> around two years ago. The game didn't quite make the same splash as any of miHoYo (now known as HoYoverse) games, like Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and now <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why Hotta is already preparing the launch of Neverness To Everness, which has been described as a supernatural urban open world RPG. Here's the official description:</p>
<p><em>Experience the fantastical Anomaly events in the supernatural city of NTE. Dive into city exploration, enjoy a vibrant and unique urban life, and embark on adventures in a world filled with mystery and wonder.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Neverness To Everness Trailer | Wonders Await, In Urban Cityscape!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdZN6H1N3PU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike Tower of Fantasy, which ran on Unreal Engine 4.26, Neverness To Everness is powered by Unreal Engine 5. However, just like Tower of Fantasy, it will support NVIDIA technologies like DLSS and ray tracing on PC.</p>
<p>A 13-minute gameplay trailer provides a first look at the visuals, the hack-and-slash action combat, and what is perhaps at first glance the biggest innovation: the ability to drive the cars.</p>
<p><iframe title="NTE Gameplay Trailer | Neverness to Everness" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eguKZyaDyQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There's no release info yet, but you can pre-register for PC, mobile, or console <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/concept0718/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via the official website</a>.&nbsp;Meanwhile, here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what we thought of Zenless Zone Zero in our review</a>:</p>
<p><em>For those who want to dip their toes into the expansive world of Gacha games but are deterred by the other games currently on the market, Zenless Zone Zero is one I would genuinely recommend, despite only being able to play it in short bursts. Additionally, you'll love every second of this game if you're a fan of wild theatrics and flashy cutscenes.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-astro-bot-is-around-12-to-15-hours-and-will-feature-an-overhauled-game-engine.928158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Team Asobi's upcoming Astro Bot for PlayStation 5, will feature an overhauled game engine and will take around 12 to 15 hours to complete.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://youtu.be/2uOjOeJplVI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new interview</a> with Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director, Nicolas Doucet, French journalist and YouTuber Julien Chièze talked about the sequel to 2020's Astro's Playroom. Featuring 80 levels, we already<a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> knew that the sequel would be the studio's biggest game to date</a>, but know we also got additional details about the actual length of the main game. As revealed by Doucet, the team would rather reduce the length of the game, than get repetitive. Team Asobi wanted a sequel with a constant tempo instead of just stretching out the game. Apparently, the team never aimed for the game to be 20+ hours. Instead, they opted for a game length of around 12 to 15 hours. Many players consider this as the sweet spot for platform titles in this day and age.</p>
<p>Compared to the 2020 PS5 launch title, Astro Bot will feature an overhauled game engine, resulting in additional physics as well as improved visuals. In addition, for this sequel, Asobi formed an internal 'DualSense 2.0' team consisting of three to four people in order to think out new ideas on how to use the PS5 DualSense controller. As most of you recall, Astro's PlayRoom was already a showcase for Sony's PS5 controller, and from the looks of it, Astro Bot will make even better use of the DualSense. We've included the interview with Doucet below. Be sure to watch it as it includes additional details about the upcoming PS5 title.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASTRO BOT 💙 Rencontre avec Nicolas Doucet, une TONNE d'infos inédites sur l'exclu PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2uOjOeJplVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As covered yesterday, Team Asobi <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ditched an open-world design</a> for Astro Bot in favor of in-game variety. "<em>Actually, we did consider, at first: should this be an open world game?", </em>the Creative Director said in the latest issue of EDGE Magazine<em>. "In the end, we went for a level-based approach, because that was the one that gave us the most control over the game’s variety."</em></p>
<p>Astro Bot launches worldwide on PS5 on September 26. It's likely that the game will also get a PC release later on.</p>

You get shoulder and trigger buttons, familiar face buttons, and a staggered layout for the analogue sticks. When you're not playing, a Backbone One folds down and takes up minimal space to easily fit in your pocket. The current generation models have a USB-C connection that works with Android smartphones and iPhone 15. If you have an older iPhone, lightning-connection versions are also available.</p><p>The Backbone One is available in white and black color options with PlayStation or Xbox button labels. The first-gen models are a little more limited, but if you have an iPhone with a lightning connection, these are worth picking up, especially at this price. We're also seeing a lot more modern games arrive on smartphones, so grabbing one of these is worth the investment for when you want to enjoy some gaming on the go.</p><p>Genshin Impact developer HoYoVerse recently launched Zenless Zone Zero on mobile, and if you have a Netflix account, you can play the terrific Hades on your phone. Throw in a subscription to Apple Arcade or try out some cloud gaming through an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and you have a ton of options to choose from for your mobile gaming sessions.</p><hr>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gog-confirms-fallout-london-wont-be-playable-through-epic-games-store-versions-of-fallout-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the most extensive mods to ever come to Fallout 4 is on the horizon, and players will soon get to experience <a href="https://fallout4london.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallout: London</a>, which GOG.com, a massive PC storefront, is hosting. However, they have sadly confirmed that those who own the game after purchasing it on release on the Epic Games Store cannot participate in Fallout: London as it currently stands.</p>
<p>For those who may not have heard the news, Fallout: London is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch/">biggest mod for the game</a>. It's a conversion mod that takes the world of Fallout 4 and converts it into a brand-new story and atmosphere where you can explore London in a post-apocalyptic world that comes with fresh quests, new NPCs to talk to, and a whole bunch of exploration to do!</p>
<p>Due to Bethesda releasing the Next-Gen Update for Fallout 4, they had to scrap their previous release date of April 23, which left the mod hanging in a bit of a weird place. They weren't sure how to proceed to ensure the mod would work with the game. Now, the launch date is really close, as the modders have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-has-sent-multiple-builds-to-gog-and-is-waiting-for-the-green-light-to-launch/">shared</a> several release candidate builds with GOG, which is helping them distribute the game.</p>
<p>To make the Fallout: London mod work, players must "downgrade" their version of Fallout 4 and eliminate the Next-Gen Update from their game. This ensures that the mod runs and players can get the whole experience. To accommodate the issue of having to roll back the update, GOG has ensured that their version of the game available on the storefront will be able to roll back with no problems.</p>
<p>However, players playing the game on Steam or, worse yet, the Epic Games Store may find themselves in a pickle. Currently, the modders don't quite know if or when the mod will be compatible with the Epic Games Store version of the game. Those who don't own the game yet will be able to pick it up from GOG.com and ensure that they can run the mod with no issues for the time being.</p>
<p>For those who own the game on Steam, which will be a vast majority of the population, they are currently working on a version that will allow players to get stuck into Fallout: London once they have figured out a way to roll back the update. That is still in progress, with the GOG version of the game being a certainty.</p>
<p>The team developing the mod did not make these decisions lightly, as they found out relatively late about the update and that it would make the mod unstable and unusable. While they don't have an end date in sight, they are working on a mod version to be accessible for those who have the Next-Gen Update for Fallout 4 installed.</p>

There's some powerful hardware inside of the HTC Vive Pro 2, as it offers 5K resolution split across two 2,448 x 2,448 lenses, a refresh rate of 120Hz, and a 120-degree field of vision. The main drawback to this headset is that it's a tethered model when compared to the wireless design of the Quest 3 and setting it up can take some time, and the controllers are sold separately.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4333191-vivebody.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4333191" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4333191-vivebody.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4333191"></a><figcaption>HTC Vive Pro 2 headset</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4333191-vivebody.jpg"></figure><p>If you're fine with that--and you're probably already an advocate for VR gaming--then this headset easily offers a premium experience.

<p>Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev is yet to make a major appearance in the Counter-Strike 2 scene, having only played one competitive match since the game dropped in September 2023. Shortly after the game was released, s1mple announced a break from competing, much to the disappointment of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>He’s affectionately known as the GOAT of CS and he boasts one of the most impressive profiles out of any esports player to ever call the industry home. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-return-of-the-goat">The Return of the GOAT</h2>



<p>Thorin and s1mple had a brief exchange on Twitter that led to Kostyliev expressing his desire to return to Counter-Strike esports. Thorin directly questioned s1mple, asking when he was coming back, to which s1mple responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s a bit hard question, hopefully soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s hardly representative of a solid return date, but it’s an indication that Kostyliev is eager to return. At just 26 years old, s1mple has plenty of time left to compete, and the fans are hungry to see him disrupt the CS2 scene. It has been a while since his last big win, though. In 2022, the player won the BLAST Premier: Spring Finals with Natus Vincere, the team he has represented since 2016. Before that, he claimed the top spot at the BLAST Premier: World Final in 2021.</p>



<p>In November 2021, Kostyliev won the PGL Major Stockholm, marking his first CS Major win <strong>ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Are you eager to see s1mple return to Counter-Strike?</p>

<p>Nicklas Bendtner, former Premier League footballer and representative of the Danish national team, has announced the launch of an esports investment group. The <strong>Legendary Gaming Group </strong>has already invested in companies aligned with the esports industry, including New Breed Agency, Legendary Arena, Team Singularity, and another brand yet to be identified.</p>



<p>In 2020, Bendtner fell in love with CSGO, kickstarting a minor gaming team and eventually playing in a showmatch in Copenhagen under the BLAST banner. He’s taking that love one step further by investing heavily in the industry.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>



<p>Bendtner, who played for Arsenal for many years, earned the title ‘Lord Bendtner’ to recognise his talents on the pitch. Since 2024 opened up, Bendtner has been working on fleshing out the Legendary Gaming Group, and the firm is now preparing to raise seed capital to push into the next phase of expansion.</p>



<p>Following the airing of this news, Team Singularity’s founder, Atle Stehouwer, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m thrilled and honoured to have found a proper home for Team Singularity under the Legendary Gaming Group wings and to have been able to bring a strong ownership group together to form the foundation of Legendary Gaming Group.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Football players love investing in the esports industry. Over the years, we’ve seen dozens of pro footballers break into the landscape in various ways. From David Beckham’s ambassadorship with Guild Esports to Sergio Aguero founding KRU Esports, some of the biggest names in the world’s most valuable sport are waltzing into the competitive gaming scene. Speaking on the foundation of the firm, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/39391/short-news-week-29#f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bendtner said</a>: ‘I am really pleased with the team we have assembled at Legendary and look forward to being part of something bigger in an industry I am fascinated by.’</p>



<p>He also reported that his ‘exact title’ is not 100% decided, but he will have an active role in the company.</p>

However, EA's servers aren't quite cooperating.</p><p>Reports have have already begun flooding X/Twitter and other social media channels as fans desperately try to access College Football 25's servers to play in Dynasty, Ultimate Team, and various other modes.</p><p>"So trying to play CFB 25 and literally nothing works. Dynasty cloud unavailable, ultimate team unavailable due to servers being down. Road to CFP unavailable," <a href="https://x.com/djdadbaugh/status/1812951292035362935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user complained</a>.</p><p>IGN has reached out to EA for an update on the server situation and will update this story with their response.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Man I sure wish I could play <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NCAA25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NCAA25</a> without EA’s fragile servers dying on schedule. </p><p>We get it.

While an internet connection isn't required to play College Football 25, there are plenty of online components to its various modes.</p><p>Over on Reddit, fans recommended disconnecting there consoles from the internet in order to access to the offline version of Dynasty — CFB 25's equivalent to Franchise — which seems to be doing the trick for some. Others are just dropping memes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CFB 25 Servers <a href="https://t.co/qkzKYq1JBR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qkzKYq1JBR</a></p>— Zirksee🍽️ (@Zirksee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Zirksee/status/1812941915236757868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>When College Football 25 eventually releases worldwide on July 19, it will be the first major college football sim since NCAA Football 14. It has garnered positive pre-release buzz from normally fickle sports fans for its presentation and in-depth career modes.</p><p>We wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-preview">our preview</a>, "Any college football fan will tell you that school spirit, traditions, and pride from the fandom deliver an unprecedented passion you otherwise would not normally see from most professional sports leagues. From the energetic broadcasts from Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbsteirt, to Clemson Football players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCLt6VPudwk&amp;pp=ygUmQ2xlbXNvbiBGb290YmFsbCBEZWF0aCBWYWxsZXkgaGlsbCBydW4%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running enthusiastically down The Hill in Death Valley</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYuSCk1EFxg&amp;pp=ygUWUFNVIEZvb3RiYWxsIFdoaXRlIE91dA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Out game at Penn State</a>, College Football 25 absolutely conveyed that college pride and enthusiasm."</p><p>First though, EA needs to get the servers working.

The base game adapts the game with more than 300 cards in the base game, and gives you the ability to play alone or in co-op with as many as three other players to take on the game's hideous bosses. It also adds a new caveat, though--you can work together with other players or try to sabotage them.
