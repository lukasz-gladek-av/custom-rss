            <p>Swedish video game publishers Thunderful are selling some steam, which is terrific news for those of us who don't live near saunas and are thus cruelly deprived of their widely-accepted health and wellness benefits, which date all the way back to the ancient Mayans. Oh wait, I read the press release wrong. Thunderful are actually having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/ThunderfulSale2024">a Steam <em>sale</em></a>, with up to 90% off such well-regarded games as Laika: Aged Through Blood, Swordship, Viewfinder and, just to confuse me further, several SteamWorld games.</p>
<p>Of the games on discount, I would focus on Viewfinder, now 45% off, in which you get a camera that can turn photographs into bits of walkable terrain. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/viewfinder-review">Bestest Best review</a>, Rachel (RPS in peace) enthused that "its reality-shifting, mind-bending hook is constantly fascinating, and the directions it takes will leave your head spinning in the best way possible". To that, I'm going to add Swordship - 70% off - which Matt Cox (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/swordships-11-update-is-a-great-excuse-to-get-this-snazzy-dodge-em-up-on-your-radar">hailed</a> for its "purity of purpose".</p>
<p>There's also The Gunk, which Katharine (RPS in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gunk-review">called</a> "a safe but stunning adventure from the SteamWorld devs" - it's 75% off.  Kaan Serin (RPS in Gamesradar, at the minute) was similarly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pull-off-sick-motorcycle-backflips-to-reload-in-this-gorgeous-motorvania">keen</a> on the demo for Laika: Aged Through Blood, though we never commissioned him to review it: he remarked that it "seems to be mashing My Friend Pedro's bullet violence and Trials' motorcycle-spinning physics into a Metroidvania formula". The Steam user consensus is that it sticks the landing. </p>
<p>Kaan did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/white-shadows-review-a-twisted-musical-joyride-that-loses-a-little-steam">review</a> White Shadows, currently 85% off, summarising it as "two hours of creative, chilling designs, joyous musical set pieces and enough screen-shottable sights to fill your hard drive". You can get that one for about the price of a family-sized bag of chips. Alternatively, reserve your pennies for Somerville, now 65% off, which Malindy Hetfield <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/somerville-review">summarised as follows</a>: "Mechanically simple but visually engrossing, Somerville offers an interesting, if not particularly deep, sci-fi adventure." </p><p>Thunderful have published some good stuff, though they are also one of those publishers who wildly over-invested during the pandemic lockdown years. In January this year, they announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">they would lay off around 20 per cent of their staff</a> in order "to reduce costs and focus the business on areas with the best future growth and profitability prospects".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/apartment-story-pc-sims-suspense-chekhov-godot-1851667761<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most well-known principles of theatrical storytelling is widely referred to as “Chekhov’s gun.” The principle suggests that if some element is introduced to a story, even in a casual, offhand way, by the end, it had better prove significant. Or, as it’s often summed up, if a gun shows up at some point in your story, by the end, it had better go off. So, when a gun shows up early in my playthrough of narrative game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/apartment-story"><em>Apartment Story</em></a></span><em>,</em> you can imagine where my mind immediately went.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="194012,193534,194617" data-current="194012"><div><p>April's Air Combos Make Her TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge’s Raddest Playable Character</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194012/194012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The game, from developer Blue Rider Interactive, is clearly working within that basic narrative concept but its connections to theater and the medium’s style of storytelling go even deeper. What that results in is a brisk esoteric narrative blending Chekhov with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683"><em>The Sims</em></a></span> in fascinating ways that don’t always work, but are utterly unique in execution.</p><p>Before the gun shows up in <em>Apartment Story</em>, you might find the gameplay loop pretty mundane, even boring. It’s a life simulator in which you control Arthur, an out-of-a-job writer cooped up in his apartment doing nothing of importance. You’ll take a shower, eat some food, have a cigarette, type away at your computer, jerk off, drink beer, watch a movie, or any number of basic things. What makes these activities all the more interesting, however, is how much effort each of them take. </p><figure id="" data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-recommend-id="image://a7343d10b86f929e7f3c57d95efaaa67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An overhead shot of a man cooking food on a stove" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want to make a basic meal you need to manually open the fridge, individually pick up each ingredient and drop it on a cooking board, activate the stovetop to actually cook, wait 15 in-game minutes, grab a plate to serve the food on, then sit down at a table to eat. It’s a lengthy process and on paper it’s pretty uninteresting, but the mundane loop still manages to scratch that itch in your brain that makes you want to do it again and again. To encourage you to actually engage with the loop, Arthur has a list of needs that must be managed, like hunger. If any of these stats gets too low you’ll start moving slower.<br></p><p>Arthur’s normal life begins to get strange when his old roommate Dianne shows up asking to grab something from one of his rooms. That mysterious thing is, shocker, the gun. It’s been hidden in the bedroom of your absent current roommate Godot (more theater references for you). Dianne tells you a story about how she is running from her abusive lover and is ready to protect herself in any way. Over the next couple of in-game days, during which you still have to manage all your stats, Dianne’s entrance back into your life turns it into a thriller in which your safety is not guaranteed. That is first illustrated when you awake one morning to discover everything in your apartment has been thrown across the floor and a man named Blondie—who identifies himself as Dianne’s lover—is sitting at your dining table. He tells you to stay away from Dianne and then beats the shit out of you. </p><p>While Blondie’s appearance should have made me worry for Dianne and Arthur’s lives, the first thing I felt was rage at the state of the apartment. This asshole threw all of my shit across the apartment and now I have to clean it. I had to pick up each book, DVD, plant, and fork one-by-one and organize them in some way that made the apartment feel clean again. It’s an excellent way to make me more invested in the outcome of the story, because after that, I kind of wanted to kill that guy too!</p><figure id="" data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Rider Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-recommend-id="image://07bf2bc9f7732ce069be59e23a669238" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man in a black sweat suit stands in an apartment with items scattered across the floor" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The use of Chekhov’s gun in <em>Apartment Story</em> keeps you on your toes, which is what the device has always been intended to accomplish. Once the gun is in the picture you’re more on edge, more attentive to everything Arthur, Dianne, and Blondie do and say. But what’s even more interesting is how <em>Apartment Story</em> adds a twist to the narrative device that only games can—while tradition says that the gun must go off, <em>Apartment Story</em> leaves that decision up to you. No gun actually has to be fired, though there will be consequences to pulling the trigger or not. There is also plenty of narrative downtime, during which you’ll have to occupy several in-game hours of Arthur’s life with mundane tasks while you wait for something to happen, which breaks up the dramatic highs in an absurdly hilarious way thanks to the ridiculous life-sim elements.<br></p><p>From start to finish, <em>Apartment Story</em> will take you about two hours to complete. The writing is strongest in the early sections of the game, as it feels more grounded in the mundanity of Arthur’s depressing life. As the game goes on, and the stakes get higher, the story devolves into melodrama with some predictable beats. But the blending of life sim elements with a high stakes narrative that takes place in a relatively short period of time—both in-game and in reality—makes for a compelling game that has you steadily more invested as it goes on. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Iron Gate has unveiled what’s next for Valheim, uncovering the Bog Witch update, which is preparing to enter public testing. Valheim, which entered early access in 2021, has proven to be a hit with gamers worldwide, offering a tougher-than-average title with base-building, combat, and RPG mechanics.</p>



<p>In the game’s next major update, Iron Gate is adding a mysterious denizen, new multiplayer mechanics, farming, and a range of fresh decorations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-go-down-to-the-bog">Go Down to the Bog</h2>



<p>The swamps of Valheim aren’t to be trifled with, but per the latest update that Iron Gate is working on, you’ll soon have a new reason to venture down to the bog. In this upcoming patch, players will be able to find The Bog Witch, a mysterious vendor selling all manner of potions, materials, and crafting recipes.</p>



<p>If you’re an adept chef, you’ll be able to utilise new features added in this update to prepare monumental feasts for your friends, thanks to the ingredients and recipes you get from The Bog Witch. To stay on theme, Iron Gate is adding a string of recipes themed on the swamps, such as the Swamp Dweller’s Delight.</p>



<p>In addition, players will be able to grind new and updated skills: Cooking and Farming. If you want, you can equip a scythe to make it easier to harvest your crops – that’s new in this update as well. If that wasn’t enough, Iron Gate is introducing new kitchen stations, a line of decorations, and some mysterious cooking ingredients, keeping everything aligned.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when The Bog Witch update will arrive, but keep your eyes peeled – it won’t be long.</p>



<p>Do you enjoy playing Valheim? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Lavapotion has revealed the first major DLC for its turn-based strategy game Songs of Conquest. The Vanir DLC update will add a new player faction, units, biome, and more to Songs of Conquest this winter.</p>



<p>According to Lavapotion, the Vanir faction is inspired by Scandinavian and Viking folklore.</p>



<p>“In the world of Aerbor, the Vanir are direct descendants of indebted Baryans and Arleon settlers who have become a raiding nation scouring the Bleak East region for riches,” the studio said. “However, the Bleak East is a hostile place, and the Vanir were forced to embrace the temperamental creatures of the land known as Vildra, allowing them to change into fearsome beasts full of rage and power.”</p>



<h2 id="h-songs-of-conquest-vanir-dlc-details">Songs Of Conquest Vanir DLC Details</h2>



<p>With the addition of the new faction comes new unites for players. There are eight new units in total to build your armies with as Vanir.  Those units are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Huskarl </strong>– a sturdy warrior equipped with a spear and shield that can transform into a Korphan</li>



<li><strong>Berserker </strong>– a juggernaut full of rage that can change into a mighty bear to challenge any who seek to hurt their brethren</li>



<li><strong>Chieftain </strong>– a commander of the Vanir force that can grow to enormous proportions and become the gigantic and mighty Jormr</li>



<li><strong>Swine </strong>– embodying the mythological beast eaten by gods each night only to be resurrected the next day</li>



<li><strong>Troll</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lyke</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bacahorse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nornor</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Also coming with the DLC are nine new Wielder hero units, five new Conquest maps, and even two new Challenge maps. The maps are built to offer players a challenge while learning the new faction and terrain.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-change-in-plans">A Change In Plans</h2>



<p>The announcement of the Vanir DLC is a change from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/songs-of-conquest-sells-500000-copies-announces-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced roadmap</a>. Vanir was originally scheduled for the spring 2025, but plans changed after feedback from players.</p>



<p>“While our original plan was to release a large expansion next year that would feature two new factions and a sweeping new campaign, we chose to listen to our players and change our plans to release more content sooner, starting with the release of the Vanir DLC this winter,” Lavapotion founder and CEO Magnus Alm said.  </p>



<p>By changing the focus of development, the Rise Eternal campaign has been pushed back from the fall 2024 release.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Songs of Conquest Vanir DLC launches this winter. An exact release date as well as price will be available at a later date. The game is available on Steam, but is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/strategy-game-songs-of-conquest-coming-to-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to mobile</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The promotion runs from now though January 19, 2025, though it's unclear if the Fortnite tie-in game has an expiration date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epic-google-app-store-ruling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in December, Epic Games <a href="https://aftermath.site/epic-wins-google-case-which-i-did-not-see-coming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won its case</a> against Google, which began all the way back in 2020 when Epic<a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store-1844717397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launched its own store</a> on Apple and Google phones and was subsequently banned from their app stores. Epic mostly lost against Apple, but things on the Google front went way better for the company. Yesterday, the judge handed down his final ruling, ordering Google to change its policies in some major ways. Also Tim Sweeney made a groan-worthy joke about it.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> summarizes, Judge James Donato ordered Google to open up its app store for three years, letting alternate stores like Epic’s mobile Games Store app onto Google Play proper. These stores also aren’t obligated to use Google Play Billing, and can point users to other download and payment options (a big sticking point during both trials). Additionally, Google can’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954107/here-is-the-full-list-of-developers-google-targeted-with-project-hug-deals-in-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivize developers</a> to launch their apps on the Play store or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954111/google-boasted-it-got-riot-games-not-to-launch-its-own-app-store-by-offering-10m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>not</em> to launch</a> on other stores or on their own, practices we learned it engaged in during the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trial</a> to the tune of eye-watering sums.&nbsp;</p><p>Google has, of course, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appealed</a> the ruling. In its statement, it cites the Apple ruling, writing that “Apple and Google compete directly” for customers and developers, and that “The initial decision and today’s Epic-requested changes… undercut Android’s ability to compete with Apple’s iOS.”&nbsp;</p><p>On Twitter, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney cheered the ruling, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843394694975500310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> that “all app developers, store makers, carriers, and manufacturers have 3 years to build a vibrant and competitive Android ecosystem with such critical mass that Google can't stop it.” Then, when Google appealed, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843423301169013162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>, “Google has announced it will a peel” and tweeted a&nbsp; picture of <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190328130449/https://kotaku.com/fortnites-new-banana-skin-is-not-right-1833066805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nightmare fuel</a> character, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-apple-knows-fortnites-peely-is-a-monster-1846860238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple trial hot topic</a>, Peely.</p><figure></figure><p>Whatever, it’s a tweet, but I will always be fascinated by watching Epic try to figure out who it’s playing to with this fight. Its Apple approach, aimed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-about-this-sucks-1844720017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weaponizing players,</a> could be called a failure, though it gave us <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epics-trial-apple-fortnite-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some laughs</a>. Its Google approach, aimed at being adults in front of the adults on the jury, was far more successful, at the cost of, well, being a bit less fun for regular folks following along at home, though it remains fuel for the "sir" school of reply guys under Sweeney's tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>Sweeney and Epic can never resist the urge to inflate the whole thing a bit too much, but at the same time, it kind of <em>is</em> a big deal. The Google trial jury ruled that Google has a monopoly in app stores and billing on its phones, and through the judge’s ruling yesterday the remedy for that is that it… doesn’t get to have a monopoly anymore, at least temporarily. It’s a big win against big tech, part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/business/antitrust-case-tracker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing pushback</a> to these practices. When I talk about these cases with my non-gaming friends, I feel a little bad for myself as I bang the table excitedly and they say, “Wait, you mean the game with the dances?..” Explaining the ways this could actually be good for game developers and players feels a little like carrying water for Epic’s ultimate crusade to make more money.</p><p>As a journalist, I at least have a professional excuse to care about this stuff a bit too much; I will never forget how, early on in the saga, I fell asleep waiting for a filing and had a nightmare that I missed it, only to wake up in a panic and realize I <em>had</em> missed it. My entire relationship to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em></a> has been a bit like this, an obligation leading to actual interest and a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnites-black-hole-is-over-1839050526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early mornings</a> and a grudging, growing respect for the things Epic is using its tentpole game to do, even if <a href="https://aftermath.site/bandcamp-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-following-epic-sale-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all of it is good</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Epic recently launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>another</em> lawsuit</a> against Google and Samsung, aimed at how <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-phones-eu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard it is to download its store on their phones</a>. It feels ridiculous–<em>another one</em>, <em>really?</em>--but also it <em>is</em> in fact notably difficult to get the store working on your phone! We’ll see how those cases play out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-options-outlined-ahead-of-late-october-launch.1003887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed some of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s accessibility options ahead of the game's launch at the end of this month, and the list seems pretty exhaustive.</p>
<p>The accessibility list is part of a series of deep dives detailing everything about&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, from combat to companions and more, before it arrives. EA says the goal with accessibility in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is to ensure that everyone can enjoy the game "regardless of skill level or ability".</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will offer five preset difficulty levels, running the gamut from the relaxed Storyteller mode through to the intense-sounding Nightmare. An Unbound option will also allow you to customize individual difficulty elements like parry timing, enemy aggression, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=N0SIiGEI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-accessibility-combat.jpg?itok=vFYoxNoC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will let you customize combat to your heart's content.</figcaption></figure><p>UI elements like your health bar, objective tracker, and minimap can be turned off, and you can also change the game's text size if you're struggling to read it.</p>
<p>If you suffer from motion sickness, you'll probably want to take advantage of the game's Persistent Dot option, which can help your brain to keep track of the action if it's moving too fast. You can also turn off motion blur entirely.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll find interface elements accompanied by accessibility aids; you can, for instance, add audio cues for incoming attack indicators, as well as adding full-screen filters to help with vision deficiencies.</p>
<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s list of accessibility options seems rather comprehensive. You can see the full list of accessibility features the game will have <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/accessibility-spotlight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series of dark fantasy RPGs, which began with 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>This latest installment is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer">a pretty far cry</a> from the CRPG-style gameplay of that first entry, though; it's closer in spirit to&nbsp;BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>series, focusing as it does on set pieces, companion relationships, and fast-paced action combat rather than real-time-with-pause RPG-style engagements.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/bsdx4fnnc0dk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 31st.</p>
<p>If you want to know what we thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds">take a look at our hands-on preview here</a>, and we've also got an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion">interview with game director Corinne Busche</a> that's all about player choice, companions, and more.</p>

In a report published on Tuesday, the <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">investment firm Hindenburg Research</a> claims Roblox is “consistently overstating the amount of people on its platform by 25 percent to 42 percent or more.”</p><p>Roblox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic">which went public in 2021</a>, reported <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2024/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=non%2DGAAP%20guidance.-,Based%20on%20the%20carrying%20amount%20of%20deferred%20revenue%20and%20deferred,2024%20and%20an%20increase%20in">having 79.5 million</a> daily active users in its most recent earnings report. However, Hindenburg claims Roblox “intentionally conflates” actual people with daily users, as that number could also include alt accounts and bots. The research alleges that Roblox can separate alt accounts from single users, even though the company’s disclosure says daily active users “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox.”</p><div><p>Hindenburg is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/hindenburg-research-is-making-a-name-for-itself-by-taking-on-carl-ichan-gautam-adani-and-others.html">an activist short-selling firm</a> that infamously publishes research when it says it’s identified something shady about a business, allowing it to make a profit as its share value declines. One example is from 2020, when Hindenburg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436126/nikola-fraud-allegation-hindenburg-short-seller-electric-truck">accused the EV startup Nikola</a> of fraud. Subsequently, an investigation by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848108/nikola-settlement-sec-fraud-trevor-milton-investors">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> resulted in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24006571/nikola-trevor-milton-sentence-prison-fraud-electric-truck">four-year prison sentence</a> for its founder, Trevor Milton.</p></div><p>“We totally reject the claims made in the report,” Desiree Fish, Roblox’s chief communications officer, said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “The financial claims made by Hindenburg Research are simply misleading. The authors are, admittedly short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results.” You can read the statement in full at the bottom of this article.</p><p>The firm also claims Roblox isn’t doing enough to protect children on the platform, alleging its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.” Roblox <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/short-seller-hindenburg-says-roblox-inflates-user-metrics-compromises-child-safety-92c77b5e?st=ktia3b&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">shares dipped</a> following the release of the report.</p><p>Last week, a financial newsletter also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">accused Roblox of enabling child abuse</a>. At the time, Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield denied claims that child endangerment is a widespread issue on the platform, saying it frequently updates its safety practices to “catch and prevent malicious activity.”</p><p>Here’s Roblox’s full statement:</p><div><blockquote><p>We totally reject the claims made in the report. The financial claims made by Hindenburg Research are simply misleading. The authors are, admittedly short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results. Over the past four quarters our bookings, the amount of cash receipts, have grown over 22% from $780.7 million in Q2 2023 to $955.2 million in Q2 2024. Over the same time, cash provided by operating activities have totaled $646.3 million, free cash flow was $440.3 million, and we have guided to even higher numbers for fiscal 2024. An examination of our GAAP balance sheet and our GAAP cash flow statement makes that clear. The focus on cash bookings and cash flow are themes that we have focused on consistently with investors dating back to our days as a private company. The author made no attempt to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don’t support their agenda.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, October 8th: </strong>Added a statement from Roblox.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Coffee Stain and developer Box Dragon have unveiled a new roguelike deck builder called As We Descend. The reveal took place during Coffee Stain’s “The Spill” showcase event on Tuesday.</p>



<p>“As We Descend takes a strategic twist to the beloved deckbuilding roguelike genre,” the studio said. “Recruit units for your expeditions, navigate political treachery, enlist allies across the city, and take on incomprehensible foes.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="As We Descent - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yLbne3m3aA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The first game from Box Dragon, As We Descend features turn-based combat as well as card crafting. There is also relationship building for players which will impact the characters met in a “desperate city which evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions”.</p>



<p>The game’s director, Kevin Chang, said during The Spill described it as a strategy sandbox based on the decisions players are allowed to make while they play. He also hinted the game has a Dark Souls-like difficulty where it will provide a fair challenge for players.</p>



<p>The game doesn’t have a release date just yet. However, there is a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">available on Steam</a> to give players a first look at what they can expect on a full release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/paradox-chinese-room-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sequel-someone-else<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Chinese Room will try and get Bloodlines 2 to the finish line in the first half of 2025.</h2></div><section><p>Paradox Interactive seems ready to be done with Vampire: The Masquerade — and with RPGs in general — with deputy CEO Mattias Lilja telling <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/paradox-wants-to-get-out-of-the-rpg-business-if-bloodlines-2-god-willing-is-successful-bloodlines-3-will-be-done-by-someone-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> that any potential Bloodlines 3 will be "done by someone else."</p><p>Lilja opened up about Bloodlines 2's development in the course of an unusually frank interview, itself part of a media tour seemingly designed to show how Paradox was being reset after a string of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review">problematic releases</a> and reports of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-staff-slam-culture-of-silence-which-let-man-with-reputation-for-harassment-continue-in-role-for-years#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic work culture</a>. Paradox's overarching message? It's sticking to what it's good at, and what it's good at is strategy games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"It is not in our strategic direction to make this kind of game," Lilja told PC Gamer. "So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us. I would say it's the sort of strategic way this would work. So it's still an outlier from what we're supposed to do, we don't know that stuff, so we should probably let other people do it."</p><p>In short, Lilja considers Bloodlines a "dead end" for the company regardless of how well it does, which is made more awkward by the fact that Paradox Interactive owns Vampire: The Masquerade creator White Wolf Publishing. Lilja didn't talk about Paradox's plans for White Wolf, but it seems as if any future Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines RPGs will be licensed out to other developers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So if Bloodlines 2, God willing, is successful, Bloodlines 3 [will be] done by someone else, on the license from us</p></div><p>"I think some studios do strategic investments, long term things, because they feel that the cost of not doing it is too high. But, I mean, I think it's fairly clear, at least to me, and I think to you, even in the best of cases, Bloodlines does not have a super long shelf life. That's not the way these games behave. You have an influx of players, there's a bit of word of mouth, and they have a high peak, and then they trail off. And it's not the type of gameplay that develops over time that much. So I think that's part of why these types of games are not really that attractive to us."</p><p>Lilja's comments come amid the still-ongoing development of Bloodlines 2, which was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced">announced back in 2019 as a faithful successor to the original game</a> by Troika Games — considered one of the greatest RPGs ever made. The original development was handled by Hardsuit Labs, but numerous delays and other problems led to its near cancellation before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-with-a-new-developer-and-release-window">Paradox handed development to The Chinese Room </a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"If we hadn't found The Chinese Room," deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said, "and seen what they'd done with the early work, [cancellation] would have been the next logical step, because we could not continue as we did."</p><p>The Chinese Room is taking what looks like a very different direction from Hardsuit Labs, boiling it down into more of a straightforward action RPG. Fans have posted various comparisons between the two online, noting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gameplay-reveals-bloodthirsty-combat">differences between the melee combat</a> among other things.</p><p>"Generally, it's a continuation of the same vision but they had to make it theirs," Lilja told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-on-bloodlines-2-we-had-a-game-we-could-do-but-maybe-not-with-the-team-we-had" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GI.biz</a> in a separate interview. "When a game has been going this long with a sizable team in Seattle for a number of years before we moved it... It might have commercial  challenges, but we liked the direction."</p><p>Lilja says that Paradox is targeting a first half of 2025 release for Bloodlines 2, and that development is currently on track after its suffered yet another delay in August. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-is-disclosing-apex-legends-loot-box-odds-in-even-greater-detail-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A new law in Korea has prompted Respawn to share even more decimal places.</h2></div><section><p>Today, Respawn has announced that it will be changing the way it shares the minimum drop rates of loot box (Apex Pack) items in Apex Legends in order to comply with new South Korean regulations.</p><p>In a blog post, Respawn explained that it will be releasing minimum drop rates for  Apex Pack items up to three decimal places. Previously, the company already disclosed drop rates for different item rarities, but not to this level of detail. Respawn confirmed that no drop rates are changing at this time – it’s simply providing more detailed information about what the rates are. You can see the full breakdown of drop rates in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/about/frequently-asked-questions#q3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Apex Legends FAQ</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The change is specifically occurring in response to an amendment to the Korean Game Industry Promotion Act that took effect earlier this year, which mandates that companies disclose certain information about loot box odds. However, Respawn will also be publishing the rates globally.</p><p>The actual published rates, Respawn notes, come with an important asterisk. The developer is publishing the lowest minimum drop rates for each item, but due to duplicate protection, the actual drop rates for individual items will be higher depending on how many other items of the same type from loot boxes players have obtained. With each new item obtained, the odds of receiving others go up, because players can’t get duplicates.</p><p>Additionally, Respawn confirmed that Heirloom Shards will still be a guaranteed drop after 500 Apex Packs are opened, even though the listed drop rate is shown as .045% (previously listed as &lt;1%).</p><p>The post itself goes into more detail, and you can read Respawn’s full explanation of drop rates in Apex Legends right here.</p><p>Loot boxes have long been the subject of concern in the games industry due to their similarities to gambling. Over the years, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2023-a-global-update-on-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>regulators around the globe</u></a> have made efforts to curb exploitative practices, from banning them outright in countries such as Belgium to using age-rating systems to warn parents of their presence in countries like Australia and Germany.</p><p>While in this update, Respawn didn’t technically change any of its rewards systems, it did shuffle around some things earlier this year. Following the release of changes to Battle Pass that proved unpopular with the community, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-announces-changes-to-apex-legends-battle-pass-after-community-outcry"><u>Respawn apologized</u></a> and offered a new way to purchase one of the two Battle Passes with Apex Coins.</p><p>Apex Legends is currently gearing up for Season 23, which drops on October 29, but for now you can hop in yourself for the end of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/why-now-is-the-time-to-jump-back-into-apex-legends">very excellent Season 22</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The game stars the fan favorite Majima Goro as he wakes up on a beach with no memory and, in a sea-faring alternative to his yakuza roots, becomes a pirate.</p><p>It wasn't originally going to star Majima at all, however. "For quite some time, I wanted to make a game called Like a Dragon: Tuna, where Kiryu Kazuma, as a tuna fisherman, sets off to sea to fight against fishing boats," Yokoyama said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/08/shark-1728399164136.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kiryu has a long and complicated relationship with the ocean.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Long story short, it never came to fruition, but keywords like 'ship,' 'sea,' and 'fighting,' which had since then been engraved in my head, evolved into the concept of pirates."</p><p>Kiryu has had plenty of fishy experience over the years through the myriad fishing minigames sprinkled throughout the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series. He's also resorted to beating the rowdier ones up with his fists, like in the shark boss fight from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth that's practically the end of Jaws.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin-off to Infinite Wealth, the eighth mainline entry in the Yakuza series (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">or ninth including Yakuza 0</a>). <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-renamed-like-a-dragon-in-the-west-explained-why">The series underwent a name change from Yakuza to Like a Dragon</a> upon its release, made more confusing by the seventh game being called Yakuza: Like a Dragon and starring new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Yakuza Games In (Chronological) Order</h3></div></output><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii grew into its own thing during the development of the latest game, however. "Around June or July 2023, long before the release of Infinite Wealth, the dev team was already mulling over the idea of an Infinite Wealth spin-off," Yokoyama said.</p><p>"Even if we were to make Like a Dragon 9, we knew that wouldn’t be enough to capture and tell the story. During the end of the Infinite Wealth development, we began percolating the idea of a spin-off that stars characters who are not Ichiban Kasuga. It was almost as if we were creating a blown-up sub-story for Infinite Wealth."</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii was revealed in September as a half Yakuza, half Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag-looking entry. A lengthy reveal trailer showed Majima washed up on the beach of Rich Island, near Hawaii, looking worse for wear and helped by a child with a pet tiger (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-features-ichiban-actor-in-bizarre-role">who is bizarrely played by Ichiban voice actor Nakaya Kazuhiro</a>).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This will be the first time in a while Yakuza fans have had to wait an entire year for a new release, with Infinite Wealth having arrived in January and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii not launching until February. While this is fairly normal for most game franchises, RGG Studio is known for its rapid release schedule.</p><p>In the last five years, for example, it has released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will therefore add to that list, but the next mainline game (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-fans-buzz-as-sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars">and a mysterious trademark called Yakuza Wars</a>) are yet to be revealed. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-first-preview">In our first preview of the incoming entry</a>, IGN said: "Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is ship-shaping up to be a seaworthy spin-off with a fin-favorite at its helm."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">The roguelike is quickly becoming one of my favorite genres and I've made no secret how much I love tabletop gaming, so it comes at no surprise that I enjoyed playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/as-we-descend/" data-ref-id="5000-624176">As We Descend</a>, the debut title of developer Box Dragon. As We Descend is an upcoming roguelike deckbuilding game that incorporates elements from strategy games.</p><p dir="ltr">In As We Descend, you play as a senior member of a city, directing your home's forces to fix failing technology, venture into monster-infested areas to find resources, and mount defenses for approaching threats. Your actions--both navigating the city and fighting in turn-based combat encounters--are dictated by the cards you've collected and upgraded in your deck, injecting a sense of curated randomness into each attempt to protect the city. You must find a way to protect the city as it slowly descends into the planet, uncovering secrets to this post-apocalyptic world. Each failed run sees you start over in the city centuries later, attempting to build upon whatever systems were left behind by the previous civilization embodying the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380275"></a><figcaption>As you descend further, you'll build your ideal deck.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380275-ss_99a0dc87d02e7852aa58235dce0dc4527f6e7212.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the launch of the demo for As We Descend, I got a chance to play the roguelike game and simultaneously interview game director Kevin Chang. As I marveled at the game's incredible art direction and storytelling hooks and laughed with malicious glee at combining the right order of cards to demolish the dangerous-looking demonic forces attempting to breach the city's walls, our conversation touched on Chang's background in tabletop gaming design, how As We Descend captures the exciting opening hours of a Civilization game, and how the narrative elements of the game almost didn't happen.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Did you come into this project wanting to make a tabletop-inspired game and then you adopted roguelike elements, or was the plan to make a roguelike and the systems of a tabletop game snuck in later?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Chang</strong>: It's always going to be a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation but I do feel like I did approach wanting this to just be a really good roguelike game. Actually, you won't believe where it started--it was a 4X roguelike deckbuilder. So it was very siege-like--non-violent--and I tried so many wild ideas. I even have an old build of the game. I'll show you sometime. It's in a little command prompt and we added mouse-and-keyboard support to it, and there's a little hex grid that you get to just play on. It's the funniest thing. It looks like Dwarf Fortress.</p><p dir="ltr">...It did just keep moving closer to tabletop unintentionally. Early on we were like, 'Okay, it's going to make it super strategic, going to make it really replayable,' and then people kept wanting more conflict, more hype, more [excitement]. I think a big part of that was of course we found our art director, [Aleks Nikonov]. He used to work at Riot Games as a senior concept artist for both their sort of environmental design and also their characters once we hired him. So [tech director] Karl [Bergström] and I co-founded the studio together. We used to work at Stunlock Studios. This was back in 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">We found Aleks, I want to say in the summer of 2020, and when we hired him, we went, 'Wow, we can actually make sure the game looks amazing now,' because, between Karl and myself, we can make a very fun game. I'm a game designer and Karl's a programmer. We can land a good game, but can we make it look amazing? No. [But now] we've got Alex, and we're like, 'Okay, we can make it look amazing.' So we leaned more into it--I would say that is probably the biggest impetus for change. I don't think it was even a tabletop or roguelike thing. It was more like, 'What is the potential of the studio and sort of the team potential?' and we wanted to just lean into it more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380277"></a><figcaption>Each unit archetype features different weapons and decks, so you can curate several different combat decks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380277-ss_f5491a0e539fe3b8a571b0f070cf34db77923d1b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>So to focus a bit more on that change in direction, why opt for the cyclical nature of a roguelike to tell a story? Neither tabletop campaigns nor strategy games tend to lean into cyclical stories, even if mechanically they can be sometimes.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The problem [in strategy games like Civilization] is the sort of late game--in Civ I might pass turn 200, 300, maybe even 400 depending on the run. You just have so many units, so many cities, and the decisions you make aren't that impactful anymore. You have to move a bunch of troops. There's so much logistics to do--which [does match] the feeling of controlling this massive unwieldy empire, but it's also a chore. [You spend] a lot of time doing very little, and that's the part we want you to fix [with As We Descend]. We're like, 'Okay, can we capture the magic of that first 45 minutes of [Berlin] game where you're making good decisions, you're choosing from a random tech tree where you are finding the best places to settle?'</p><p dir="ltr">...As We Descend is all about making choices and pivoting the whole time. We don't want that feeling to go away. So that's been there from the start. And I think the thing that has been more fleshed out over time [is] this idea about what the unlockables are in the game... I think nowadays people expect unlockables in roguelikes.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm a fan of both difficulty and, what I would call, side-grades or horizontal unlocks--anything that gives you more content to play with or more ways to enjoy the game. It's more sandbox-y, so it's not Rogue Legacy or something like that where the game gets easier for you the more you play. You get more ways to interface with [the game] as you play more. You get to customize it more, but the game doesn't necessarily get easier for you. In fact, if anything, maybe it gets harder actually as you learn more, you unlock more and [there are] more choices and more interesting decisions too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380279"></a><figcaption>As We Descend is pretty brutal so you'll lose units if you don't play strategically.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380279-ss_c1f900c1147fb302fc30b4bdbab67de5fcc1c9be.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The narrative elements of As We Descend are probably my favorite part of the game--I like how they inform and characterize the city. And the skill checks for talking with people warms my little TTRPG-loving heart.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We've only had strong, narrative-driven characters for the past seven months I want to say, maybe eight months.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wait, what?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. Before that, it was a very, very impersonal city. I kept arguing with other people, being like, 'Hey, we have to include this. We have to put the lore text in. We have to make these characters good. We have to make you care about the characters here.' I kept impressing upon them the sort of urgency I felt of that mission because, without that intimacy of just caring about the city, [As We Descend] does become just yet another strategy game where you don't give a f***--the troops die and it's whatever, and there are no stakes there, but sure, let's pretend there are stakes, [and if] you lose the city and you die off, it's whatever. That's not the same as something like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frostpunk-2/" data-ref-id="5000-536249">Frostpunk</a> or a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades</a> where you know the characters, you care about their stories and their journeys and that adds a lot more meaning to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4380280"></a><figcaption>You'll often be summoned to speak with important members of the city and make choices in how you interact with them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4380280-ss_7f4a3b199974a1a96018394dddb3888c5941fb75.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do these fleshed-out characters inform the characterization of the protagonist? How far can a player stress the protagonist's morals in defense of the city?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I want [choices] to matter but not in a morality system way, which I think is a bit shallow... I think a good character to talk about is actually Geralt from The Witcher because he always makes Geralt-like decisions no matter what--the game only offers you Geralt-like decisions for all the pathways. They'll never give you a choice where he does something out of character. So I think it's going to actually be similar here where your character will never act completely out of character, but you will be able to choose within the framework you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">There are quite a few origin stories for your character. You come from one of the three great houses that inhabit the city, and you can choose what your origin is, what ally you start with, and there might be some additional sub-choices within that. But the goal is [to make you] always this person who is thrust into this position of power, being a warden of the wall. You are not actually the dictator that's at the top or the authoritarian [voice]. I think that's such an overdone thing in strategy games, but I also think it misses the topic a little. It doesn't let us introspect into this idea about being at the whims of something much greater than yourself--it plays into this fantasy of being like an authoritarian sandbox. You get to just dictate as you please, and I think [As We Descend] is not a game where you get [that fantasy]. There's so many other things that bind you in this game to your responsibility.</p><p dir="ltr">So within that framework, you'll get to make choices that matter, and I hope that when you play later versions of this game, that it really does feel like whatever you choose, you are giving yourself a character by the choices you make, but I don't want it to be in a character creation way or a, 'you get to define these things' [way]. It is not like we're doing a dating simulator or anything like that. You'll reflect who you are through your character's choices, and I want the story to be able to reflect as much of that as possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-accused-of-being-an-x-rated-pedophile-hellscape-in-damning-report.1003818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-report-pedophile-hellscape-lying-investors<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A damning new report has emerged that accuses&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>and its creators Roblox Corporation of fostering an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" on the platform, as well as lying to investors about engagement and more.</p>
<p>The report comes courtesy of Hindenburg Research, and it's an incredibly comprehensive and lengthy document backed up by a huge amount of research, as well as conversations with former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientists and developers.</p>
<p>Some of its more shocking findings include discovering that&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>groups are "openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography", and that users have "identified issues of simulated rape, naked users, and rampant in-game sexual harassment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=XnKkf8gf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-racing.jpg?itok=6t9RZdQv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games and experiences are innocuous, but Hindenburg Research's report shows that a huge number are not.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Hindenburg Research's report found that moderation was "largely outsourced to Asian call centers", and that moderators were "paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying".</p>
<p>What's more, Hindenburg says moderators have a "limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently", suggesting perhaps that Roblox Corporation's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/roblox-financials-trust-safety-spending">decision to cut its trust and safety spending</a> earlier this year was not a particularly sound one.</p>
<p>As well as the horrifying details of what the company found during its time on&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(of which there are many, many more in the full report), Hindenburg Research also says its data suggests Roblox Corporation could be lying to its investors and advertisers about its engagement and user numbers.</p>
<p>Roblox Corporation says its per-user-per-day engagement hour rate was around 2.4 hours in 2023, but Hindenburg's report says the studio "could be massively overstating" this number, and that its own research found users were spending just 22 minutes or so in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>games per day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=HfeEmWwc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roblox-report-moderation-lying-monster.jpg?itok=iAc1SeB7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This monster may well be the least harrowing thing you'll see in&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>today.</figcaption></figure><p>One former&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>data scientist told Hindenburg Research that the platform's actual number of daily active users (DAUs) could be "like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower" than the number&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>itself states.</p>
<p>According to Hindenburg's research,&nbsp;Roblox Corporation effectively reports two different user numbers: one that includes users with multiple alternate accounts, which is for "internal business decisions", and one that discounts alts, which is for investors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report</a> is well worth a read; it's an exhaustively-researched look at just how much Roblox Corporation might be getting away with, and since safety concerns have been raised by other entities as well, including investigative YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People Make Games</a>, much of it is likely to be accurate.</p>
<p>The report also appears to have caused&nbsp;<em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>shares to <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/hindenburg-research-discloses-short-position-on-roblox-alleging-inflated-metrics/articleshow/114051997.cms?from=mdr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fall by almost 10%</a>, although stock prices tend to fluctuate so regularly that this might not be an indication of long-term damage. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

<p>It looks like Saudi Arabia wasn’t looking to increase its stake in Nintendo. Instead, the country, through its Savvy Games Group, has reduced its stake in the company.</p>



<p>On Monday, a report from Kyodo News claimed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) was looking at increasing its shares in Nintendo. The outlet <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/10/71fd22ea510c-saudi-wealth-fund-eyes-raising-stakes-in-nintendo-other-game-firms.html?phrase=Nintendo&amp;words=Nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ultimately updated their story</a> to say they were looking at all Japanese gaming companies as opposed to just Nintendo. Now, 24 hours later, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/saudi-arabias-pif-cuts-stake-in-nintendo-after-report-said-it-was-considering-increase.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> has come out with a report stating the opposite.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nintendo-shuts-down-another-popular-switch-emulator">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-shuts-down-another-popular-switch-emulator/">Nintendo Shuts Down Another Popular Switch Emulator</a></h6>



<p>According to CNBC, Saudi Arabia’s PIF has reduced its stake in Nintendo to 7.54% from 8.58%. The source is a Japanese regulatory filing from Tuesday.</p>



<p>At 7.54%, it remains one of the largest shareholders in Nintendo. It’s still higher than the original 5.01% it owned when it first bought in to the company in 2022.</p>



<p>What do you think of Saudi Arabia ultimately lowering their stake in Nintendo rather than increase it? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Epic Games, the company behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine, just won a significant antitrust case against Google, meaning the Android mobile store must open up alongside other requirements. However, Google announced it's already appealing the order.</p><p dir="ltr">Google vice president of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland detailed why the company is fighting back against the ruling on <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Google blog</a>. For starters, Mulholland points out that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">Epic already lost a similar case to Apple</a>, though <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/07/google-ordered-to-open-android-app-store-in-epic-games-case.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> notes that was decided by a judge--Google's case was decided by a jury. As such, Mulholland writes: "In contrast, the Apple decision, upheld on appeal, rightly found that Android and iOS compete in the same market. This is obvious to anyone who has bought a smartphone."</p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Mulholland argues Google and Apple fight for app developers. The ruling puts a three-year ban on Google paying developers for exclusive apps, for instance, per CNBC. Last but not least, "Android is open and Google Play is not the only way to get apps," writes Mulholland. Google highlights that Fortnite is available on Android phones through the Samsung Galaxy store.
