<p>To infinity...</p>

<p>After catching our eye at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025-all-switch-1-and-2-reveals">The Game Awards</a> last year, we were delighted to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a> in today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, particularly with a 'Summer 2026' window attached to it.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one back in December, Orbitals is a co-op-only space adventure from Japanese indie dev Shapefarm and Keplar Interactive. It appears to carry many of the same puzzle platforming head-scratchers as something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, with its split-screen abilities promising plenty of couch conversation — though GameShare was also confirmed today, so feel free to play online too.</p>
<p>Once again, the thing that got us the most excited was the visuals, which look like they have been taken straight out of a classic anime. Protagonists Maki and Omura look particularly delightful, with the new trailer showcasing more of the character-specific abilities and tools they'll be wielding along the way.</p>
<p>Here's a brief written rundown of what's in store, accompanied by some screenshots so you can see what we're so hyped about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team up in this 2-player co-op adventure as Maki and Omura and use your wits to overcome the odds in a retro anime-inspired galaxy. Can you save their home?</p>
<p>Use two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single device for split-screen local co-op, or use the Nintendo Switch 2 GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player. Plus, you can also matchmake online with your friends. Players around the world can take advantage of Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat feature to save the day together!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for a more precise release date in the coming months, but for now, we're off to watch that new trailer another 12 times...</p>

<p>Cool Boarders and Ninja Gaiden II launch today</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Hamster has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/rave_racer">Rave Racer</a> will be added to its <strong>Arcade Archives</strong> collection on 26th February 2026. But that's actually not the most interesting announcement.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that a new <strong>Console Archives</strong> initiative is underway for the Switch 2 starting today, with <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden_ii_the_dark_sword_of_chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> launching day one. Other titles joining the line-up at later dates include <strong>Doraemon</strong> and <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong>.</p>
<p>In short, this is probably the closest we'll get to Virtual Console in 2026, since Nintendo itself has fully embraced the subscription model with Nintendo Switch Online. It's nice to see Hamster introduce an alternative that at least lets us buy the titles outright if we choose.</p>
<p>Seeing Cool Boarders on a Nintendo system is especially jarring and cool, since it's very much associated with PlayStation since its original launch in 1996. Still, we'll take it!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/</link>
            <guid>1426927</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>Guerrilla Games</strong> has finally unveiled its upcoming online co-op action game: <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>. <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank">Announced over four years ago</a>, the game indeed features the&nbsp;<strong>stylized, slightly cartoonish look</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/" target="_blank">players got a glimpse of in early 2023 with the footage leak.</a>&nbsp;It'</span>s undoubtedly a big departure from the main series' trademark highly realistic visuals, and it remains to be seen whether it will resonate with fans. Visually, at least, the MMORPG <strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers</strong>, in development at NCSoft, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certainly looks more similar to the main games</a>.</p>



<p>Anyway, first and foremost, Guerrilla's Game Director <strong>Arjan Bak</strong> reassured fans that they're not going to stop making new single player Horizon games. However, the team wanted to try something different this time around.</p>



<p>In the game, players form the titular Gathering, an elite crew of hunters serving as the last line of defense against machines that grow more dangerous by the day. <strong>The narrative is fully canon</strong> within the Horizon universe, introducing new characters, threats, and mysteries that expand the world's lore beyond what we know from <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/horizon-zero-dawn-welcome-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Forbidden West</a></strong>, and the VR exclusive <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>The launch roster of Horizon Hunters Gathering will feature diverse hunter types</strong>, such as soldiers who hold the line, infiltrators who operate from the shadows, champions who shine in battle, mercenaries with checkered pasts, and veterans seeking one final mission. <strong>The very first small-scale closed playtest will take place at the end of this month</strong>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can sign up for it via the PlayStation Beta program</a>. This test build will include three hunters: <strong>Rem</strong>, <strong>Sun</strong>, and <strong>Axel</strong>, each offering distinct combat approaches, including classic roles such as tank, support, and tactician, and teamwork dynamics. Guerrilla plans to continue expanding the roster over time through post-launch content updates.</p>



<p>Unlike the single player games, Horizon Hunters Gathering <strong>has been designed for team-based encounters</strong>. As such, to succeed in combat, you'll need to read enemy movements, time your party's attacks, and coordinate squad abilities to defeat the most powerful machines. <strong>Guerrilla even introduced a roguelite build system</strong> that lets players collect perks, weapon upgrades, and stat enhancements after each machine encounter, encouraging experimentation with power-up combinations tailored to specific challenges.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Horizon Hunters Gathering - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JubgL46Xkmk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At launch, Horizon Hunters Gathering will allow players to explore four large environments, each with unique atmospheres and squad challenges. The Hunter's Gathering serves as the central hub. It's a customizable campsite where teams upgrade gear, adjust loadouts, and prepare for expeditions before venturing into the wilds.</p>



<p>The first playtest includes two mission types designed around challenge and mastery:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Incursion</strong> tasks squads with repelling large-scale machine assaults on tribes, requiring coordination to collect randomized power-ups before confronting a relentless boss, all while a violent storm closes in. </li>



<li><strong>Cauldron Descent</strong> is a multi-stage dungeon where hunters take the offensive, choosing paths through brutal machine encounters and challenging obstacles that demand teamwork. Each cleared chamber provides power-ups that enable deeper descents and greater rewards.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The final game will include a story campaign</strong> that supports both solo play with NPCs and co-op with other players, but the narrative won't be available in the February playtest.</p>



<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering doesn't have a release date, but we know <strong>it will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression</strong> (provided you're using the same PlayStation account).</p>

              <p>The SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones give you open-ear wireless sound, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings while listening to music, podcasts, and taking calls. Unlike regular sealed in-ear headphones that block your ear canals, these bone-conduction headphones sit just in front of your ears with a flexible wraparound frame that stays in place as you move. Vibrations generated by the transducers are transmitted through your cheekbone to your inner ear, letting you keep hearing traffic and nearby conversations. You also get long battery life and a sweat-resistant design, making these a strong option for active use when situational awareness matters.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/">Visit Amazon to purchase the SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones for just $90, which saves you $40 or 31% off the original $130 list price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Unique headphones that look and sound great without causing pain</h2>
<p>A lightweight wrap-around band keeps the transducers in place, allowing a full range of motion without large ear cups or tips, so you can listen privately while still hearing conversation around you. The combination of private audio with the ability to hear your surroundings is effective when you are walking in a populated area or using headphones for physical exercise and need to be aware of your environment.</p>
<p>These bone conduction headphones from SHOKZ can withstand a lot of physical activity, poor weather, and perspiration. It has an IP67 rating, which allows it to withstand some rain, and it is also resistant to dust and other contaminants. Moisture detection will alert you if the headphones are so wet that they could be damaged during charging, which can happen after a particularly hard workout. This type of durability means you can put all your energy into your workout without worrying about how much rain or sweat may affect your headphones’ ability to work properly.</p>



<p>Your battery will allow you to complete your day-to-day tasks before needing a recharge. With a single full charge, you can get 8 hours of continuous audio playback. Additionally, with fast charging via the USB-C port, you will receive approximately 1.5 hours of listening time after a 10-minute charge, which may help eliminate lengthy interruptions during prolonged activities like long runs or bike rides.</p>
<p>When you purchase these headphones, you receive a protective carrying case, a USB-C charging cable with a magnetic connector, and a sporty headband for those who want to use them while working out. The headphones have Bluetooth technology, so they can be paired with whatever you are listening to, like a phone, tablet, laptop, or watch, and they have a simple control system that lets you skip tracks, pause/play music, and adjust the volume. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/">At $90 instead of $130, the SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones give you an affordable way to listen while staying aware of what’s happening around you during active use.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement has arrived for Horizon Hunters Gathering, a tactical co-op game coming to PS5 and PC. </p>



<p>Horizon has been in the limelight a lot lately, firstly for the Sony Tencent lawsuit, which was settled with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-clone-lawsuit-settled-with-light-of-motiram-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light of Motiram delisted</a> late last year. The other was Horizon Steel Frontiers, a new MMORPG from PlayStation and NCSoft, coming to PC and Mobile devices. Now, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-the-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other Horizon multiplayer game</a> has been announced. </p>







<h2 id="h-horizon-hunters-gathering-announced-for-ps5-hunters-combat-game-modes-and-more">Horizon Hunters Gathering Announced for PS5: Hunters, Combat, Game Modes, and More</h2>



<p>From the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubgL46Xkmk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a>, it seems that Horizon Hunters Gathering is set in the same universe but features a brand-new art style. The title will feature a growing roster of Hunters, where up to 3 players can team up in a battle against the deadly machines. The first Hunters that will be available during the playtest are Rem, Sun, and Axel. Each hunter has distinct melee or ranged playstyles and weapons. </p>



<p>There is a deep focus on the game’s combat, making it tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, based on the skills you have learned in the Horizon series. The game is somewhat like Monster Hunter World, set in the Horizon universe, featuring challenging, replayable hunts. </p>



<p>The developers have revealed 2 modes for now: Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent. Machine Incursion is a high-intensity mission where you face waves of machines emerging from underground gateways, led by a boss. Cauldron Descent is a multi-stage mode where Hunters battle brutal machines in ever-changing rooms, passing through hidden doors for power and rewards. </p>



<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering will also feature a narrative campaign that takes players through new mysteries, characters, and threats, and the story is “fully canon”. Players will also explore a variety of environments with different atmospheres, challenges, and opportunities. There’s also a social hub for players to chill out, visit vendors, upgrade gear, and team up. </p>

		<p>It was a packed Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, and while there weren’t many big surprises, the 30 minute stream definitely delivered a bunch of intriguing looking trailers for Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> games, dished out release dates and had some nice game and port reveals.</p>

<p>One in a Millennium</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It might have one of the most forgettable titles out there, but Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is still looking gorgeous. What's more, it has finally picked up a Switch 2 release date.</p>
<p>The HD-2D adventure cropped up in today's Partner Showcase with an <strong>18th June</strong> release date attached — and remember, there's still a free demo on the eShop to check out before then.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcased a little more of the game's story, which sees Elliot and his fairy companion travelling through time to save a cursed princess (is this ringing any bells?). We got a closer look at the four ages Elliot will travel between — The Age of Safekeeping, Reconstruction, Magic and Budding — as well as some pretty slick-looking boss fights.</p>
<p>We had a great time with the demo last year, and we're looking forward to seeing more of this one in a few months' time.</p>

<p>Sweet (roll)</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bethesda closed out today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase with a trio of announcements, but it was the final surprise that really got us excited. Yes, you read that headline correctly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is making its way to Switch 2 at some point this year.</p>
<p>We don't have a precise release date outside of '<strong>2026</strong>' just yet, but hey, it's confirmation!</p>
<p>This one arrived on other systems last year, so we're excited to finally see it come our way. Aside from a visual facelift and some animation tweaks, this remaster treads much closer to 'remake' territory, with almost everything being updated for the modern day.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some Switch 2 screenshots, so you can see what we're talking about:</p>

<p>And yes, the story DLCs — Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles — are included in the release too.</p>

			<p>Today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> </strong>event had a lot of announcements that were exciting for players who don't have any other console or device to play games on besides a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, because most of the biggest announcements were about games already available elsewhere coming to the Switch 2. Three of those bigger ports all came from <strong>Bethesda</strong>, as Bethesda Game Studios boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">Todd Howard</a></strong> appeared to reveal that <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered,</strong> and <strong>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</strong> are all coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>



<p>Two out of three of those ports were already spoiled ahead of the show, <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/2019353936290079221">as the reliable leaker Billbil-kun</a> revealed that both Indiana Jones and Fallout 4 were destined for the hybrid console, hours before the Partner Showcase went live.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 2.5.2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRpzxoTKKNw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The first of the ports to arrive will be Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition, which makes its way onto Nintendo Switch 2 later this month, on <strong>February 24, 2026.</strong> After that, it'll be Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's turn, arriving on the platform on <strong>May 12, 2026.</strong> Oblivion Remastered will be the last of the three ports to arrive, and it's the only one that doesn't have an exact release date yet. It just has a release window of "<em><strong>later this year</strong></em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>With the arrival of these ports, Nintendo Switch 2 players will be able to further round out their library of Bethesda-published and/or developed titles on the console, now that <strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> already has a Switch 2 version available. The biggest game that Bethesda fans are seemingly missing any news on, at least for now, is the arrival of <strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong> on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other major announcements from today's Partner Showcase Direct include a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong> on Switch 2,</a> which also carries further implications about when we'll get to see the first details for <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3.</strong> For everything announced at the Partner Showcase, <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">check out our hub page with all of the announcements, and which games we expected to appear that didn't show up</a>.</p>

            <p>Retro PC game sellers GOG have faced criticism recently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-accused-of-using-ai-generated-art-to-promote-sale-as-job-listing-indicates-theyre-keen-to-adopt-ai-assisted-development-tools">using a piece of artwork made using AI tools</a> to promote their store's new year sale. The storerunners have since claimed that this banner was a work-in-progress asset which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-shouldnt-have-happened-gog-reportedly-claim-sale-banner-made-with-al-tools-ended-up-on-store-by-mistake">slipped through onto the store by mistake</a>. Now, the platform's managing director has revealed that the company are "not planning on making absolute statements in either direction" in terms of their future AI use, following the backlash.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Maciej Gołębiewski, GOG's managing director, made that declaration as part of a response to a question from a user in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/comment/o3pqix6/?context=3">official QnA session on r/gog</a>. The user asked whether "general negative reception to use of AI generated materials" would lead the storefront to steer clear of the tech going forwards.</p>
<p>"We’re not planning on making absolute statements in either direction," Gołębiewski <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/inox_GOG/">wrote</a>. "AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward. What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn’t mean skipping human judgment."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the thread, Gołębiewski answered a user who asked whether KosmicznaPluskwa, the senior graphic designer who was the first GOG staffer to acknowledge the backlash to the AI banner via a forum post last week, is still working at GOG following an apparent sudden disappearance from GOG's Discord server. "Leaving the Discord server was a personal decision and we understand it," the managing director responded. "As mentioned, spotlight and social pressure can be overwhelming, this is a difficult situation for us internally as well. That said, we won't be sharing any further personal details and we'd like the community to respect that boundary."</p><p>GOG's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">new owner Michał Kiciński</a> is also a part of the two hour long QnA, which is still in progress as of writing and is set to run until 4PM CET / 3PM GMT, but he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth_Technology_415/">hasn't issued any responses of his own</a> to the questions about the storefront's AI use as of yet. He has responded to a user asking about GOG's Linux support plans, basically saying that it's something the company are keen on and are seeking a senior engineer to help them deliver.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041</link>
            <guid>1426828</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next game in the <em>Horizon</em> franchise, after <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>and <em>Horizon Forbidden West,</em> is something very, very different. <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> is a solo or cooperative action-focused hunting game with a vibrant art style and no release date.</p> <p>On February 5, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/">Sony and <em>Horizon</em> creators Guerrilla Games announced</a> the next entry in the post-apocalyptic open-world robot dinosaur series. However, this time around, players won’t be playing as Aloy and exploring large, photorealistic worlds alone. Instead, <em>Hunters Gathering</em> is a “tactical co-op action game” for up to three players, though it does also support solo play with NPC bots. There is no release date for <em>Hunters Gathering</em>, but it will launch on both PS5 and PC.</p>

 <p>Here’s a new 10-minute trailer from PlayStation about the just-announced game.</p>  <p>In<em> Horizon Hunters Gathering,</em> players go out solo or with up to two other players on “challenging and replayable hunts.”&nbsp; Each person picks a Hunter from a selection of playable characters with different melee and ranged weapons and abilities. There is also a “rogue-lite perk system” to further build out your character during each hunt. Between these hunts, players will return to a large “vibrant” social hub where players can meet up, prep for the next mission, and hang out. You can also customize your Hunters, visit shops, upgrade items, and team up for your next outing at this hub.</p>

 <p><em>Hunters Gathering</em> will feature a narrative campaign which will introduce “new mysteries, characters, and threats” to the world of <em>Horizon</em>. It is also a fully canon story and will be updated post-launch.</p> <p>Guerrilla Games is promising a playtest toward the end of February that will feature two game modes and let folks get their hands on the game ahead of its full launch on PS5 and PC. The game will support crossplay and cross progression across console and PC. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">You can sign up for the early beta here.</a> In the blog post announcing the game, it does sound like this thing is still fairly early on in development, so no idea if it will be out this year.</p>

 <p>“On a personal note, this is both an exciting and daunting step for us,” said Guerrilla game director Arjan Bak. “Multiplayer games have always been part of our studio’s DNA, and it’s where I began my own career. Bringing a co-op hunting experience into the <em>Horizon</em> universe is something we’ve envisioned for a long time, and we’re approaching it with care, ambition, and passion. I hope the coming months give you a sense of the scale and complexity of what we’ve been building – or better yet, let you experience it yourself in a playtest.”</p>

            <guid>1426825</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article dir="auto" data-turn-id="request-WEB:a27e9b51-0223-42bc-9c27-f84763eca532-1" data-testid="conversation-turn-4" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-turn="assistant">
<div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="8591b7fa-ce1a-4e70-a7af-ab01f5f500d9" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="525">Summer might be in the rearview mirror, but outdoor season isn’t too far away. Once these record low temperatures come back up, we’ll be back to spending our time out and about in the great outdoors. From weekend tailgates in packed parking lots to quiet camping trips deep in the woods, having reliable power can turn a good outing into a great one. That’s where a portable power station comes in, and right now BLUETTI’s Elite 100 V2 is an especially tempting option thanks to a massive discount.</p>
<p data-start="527" data-end="833"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/">The BLUETTI Elite 100 V2 portable power station is currently marked down by more than half. Normally priced at $799, it’s available for just $395 for a limited time, saving you $404.</a> For anyone who has been considering a serious power solution for outdoor adventures—or even as backup power at home—this deal lowers the barrier in a big way.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="527" data-end="833">Power 11 Devices at Once</h2>
<p data-start="835" data-end="1300">At the heart of the Elite 100 V2 is a 1,024Wh battery capacity designed to keep essential gear running all day. The power station can handle up to eleven devices at once, making it ideal for group outings or gear-heavy trips. It includes four AC outlets, two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and a car port. That setup lets you charge phones, run a portable fridge, power a griddle, or inflate a paddleboard with an electric pump without juggling cables or priorities.</p>
<p data-start="1302" data-end="1807">The unit delivers a standard 1,800W, which covers most everyday appliances. Activating powerlifting mode boosts output to as much as 3,600W for purely resistive loads. That extra headroom makes it possible to run higher-demand devices like kettles or hairdryers, something many portable power stations struggle to handle. Longevity is the name of the game here, with a design rated for more than 4,000 power cycles and backed by a warranty that covers up to five years of use.</p>


<p data-start="1809" data-end="2063">Managing the Elite 100 V2 is straightforward thanks to BLUETTI’s smartphone app. You can check battery levels, monitor performance, and adjust charging or discharging modes remotely, which comes in handy when the unit is tucked away in a tent or vehicle.</p>
<p data-start="2065" data-end="2406">Recharging the power station is impressively fast. Plugged into a wall outlet, it can jump from zero to 80 percent in just 45 minutes, with a full charge taking about 90 minutes. For longer trips, optional solar panels add even more flexibility. BLUETTI offers compatible 100W and 200W solar panels, sold separately, for off-grid recharging.</p>
<p data-start="2408" data-end="2641" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/">For those who don’t need solar charging right away, the standalone Elite 100 V2 at $395 still delivers outstanding value</a>. It’s a powerful, versatile companion for outdoor adventures and beyond, made even better by a rare, deep discount.</p>

              <p>In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct</a> that was filled with years-old ports, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> fit right in. Of course, this is really only a year old, given it’s Bethesda’s remaster of the 20-year-old original that came out everywhere else in April 2025, now coming to the Switch 2 at some point in 2026.</p> <p>The most recent&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, saw one of its own seventy-thousand remastered versions (the&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>) release on the Switch 2 in December last year.&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, which received a surprise announcement and simultaneous release of its remastered version on April 22, 2025, will now join it on Nintendo’s newer device, although rather shockingly it’s yet to sport a specific release date. Certainly all at <em>Kotaku</em> HQ watched its announcement during the Partner Showcase with the expectation of an “available later today” at the end.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this ambiguity is in part due to how&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em> still doesn’t run well on either PS5 or Xbox nearly a year after release (as a lifelong PC player, I do admit to enjoying the schadenfreude of console players getting to properly experience the infernal jankiness of Bethesda games), with the developers perhaps working on fixing ongoing issues before launching it on the even weaker tech of the Switch 2. And it’s fair to say that what was shown of the game today did not exactly look great in places.</p> <p>Still, should it arrive in working order, it’ll be splendid to have this classic and enormous RPG available on the handheld console. Sure, the Oblivion gates were a bit boring, but it remains a fantastic game that’s well worth preserving in as many forms as possible. It’s just a shame we don’t know when it’s coming out!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WARDOGS Reveal Trailer Uncovers 100-Player Tactical Warfare]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wardogs-reveal-trailer-100-player-tactical-warfare/</link>
            <guid>1426819</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the tagline indicates, WARDOGS is <strong>not </strong>an extraction shooter or a battle royale. It’s a 100-player, three-team tactical first-person shooter with some insane destruction mechanics. It’s a multi-format, cash-driven title that empowers players to rack up the dollars for participating in massive, open-ended battles.</p>



<p>The game’s first trailer has just dropped, and BULKHEAD, a British studio, has unveiled the future of this impressive shooter that’s coming soon in early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-looks-great-but-will-it-deliver">WARDOGS Looks Great, But Will It Deliver?</h2>



<p>In WARDOGS, players assume the role of a mercenary dropped into enormous battles with up to 100 players. They’re tasked with killing, securing control of vast areas, and basically causing havoc, all in the interest of making cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>It’s being developed by BULKHEAD and has been kept mostly under wraps for <strong>years</strong>, but now the game’s inaugural trailer is here and it looks fantastic:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WARDOGS - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCnEi5npoTE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>WARDOGS promises it all: destruction, vehicular combat, progression, and base-building mechanics. It has elements that take you across a vast array of combat styles and scenarios, from using rocket launchers to down jets to sitting in a treeline as a sniper-spotter duo, picking off enemies hundreds of meters away.</p>



<p>The game’s blurb on Steam tells you what to expect:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WARDOGS is a TACTICAL ALL OUT WARFARE FPS where one hundred players split across three teams fight over the control zone. Set in the derelict industrial mountains of Eastern Europe on a destructible battlefield where teamwork pays and cash is king.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you start playing WARDOGS, you’ll have $10,000 to kit yourself out. That money must be spent on a loadout including weapons, equipment, and vehicles, and everything you buy goes towards winning the match you’re placed in. Everything you do in that match generates more cash, and guess what you do there? <strong>You get more goodies</strong>.</p>



<p>Once a match ends, you’re back to $10,000. That’s the core gameplay loop of WARDOGS.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a player-driven sandbox that allows you to play how you want, when you want, and with whom you want. You can go it alone or team up, blow everything to smithereens, or take a stealth approach. It’s entirely up to you.</p>



<p>WARDOGS will enter a testing period soon, and you can sign up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to participate on Steam</a>. The game’s early access release is expected to arrive later this year.</p>

Yeah, okay, we've known that for a bit now, perhaps longer than Capcom wanted us too. But what <em>is</em> news today is that the long-rumored Leon S. Kennedy amiibo is real, and coming alongside the previously announced Grace Ashcroft amiibo this summer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was announced during today's Nintendo Partner Direct, which showed a trailer for Reqiuem mostly containing footage and news we've seen already. We knew about the February 27 release date, the Gold Editions of Resident Evils 7 and 8 releasing alongside it, and the special Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. We'd also already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-gets-behind-nintendo-switch-2-with-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-pro-controller-the-first-ever-resident-evil-amiibo-and-a-re7-re8-re-requiem-generation-pack">heard about the Grace Ashcroft amiibo before</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-2-5-2026-53-3-screenshot-1770301943694.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But we didn't <em>actually</em> know about Leon. He was, uh, strongly suspected, even before we officially knew he was going to be in the game, something Capcom tried to keep hidden <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">way longer than was necessary</a>. Since his official reveal at The Game Awards, we've seen a sudden surge of love for the classic protagonist, with fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans">referring to him as a "Hot Uncle"</a> and comparing him to Keanu Reaves.

Most recently, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-is-horrifyingly-great">previewed it on the Nintendo Switch 2 at a Nintendo event</a>, and our previewer said that "I was so terrified by being relentlessly stalked by this monster that any concerns I had about the version I was playing instantly melted away." We also recently learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-director-gives-definitive-response-to-open-world-speculation">speculation the game would be open world</a> was "dead wrong" according to the game's direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

We also learned via the Xbox Store that the game will hit Xbox consoles simultaneously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-square-enix-developer-reveals">the entire FF7R saga</a> would be on Nintendo platforms at some point. It was just a matter of time. Rebirth's appearance will effectively catch players on Nintendo platforms up with the story so far, just in time for what we hope will be the announcement and release of the third and final part of this saga.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders for Rebirth on the eshop begin today, and there are various digital bonuses available for those who take advantage of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Remake first launched in 2020 to insanely high expectations...and yet delivered anyway. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own." The game was originally a PS4 exclusive, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-announced-ps5-upgrade-details-revealed">came to PS5 with Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade</a>, and later to PC and Nintendo Switch, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Nintendo Switch 2 as well just recently</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We similarly loved Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Planet of Lana 2 Is Like a Star Wars Story Made by Studio Ghibli]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-of-lana-2-is-like-a-star-wars-story-made-by-studio-ghibli</link>
            <guid>1426807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I may have only played the opening couple of hours of Planet of Lana 2, but I lost count of the number of ways it reminded me of Star Wars. From just a single glance at one of its many gorgeous landscapes, you can see in the geography and architecture what look like Studio Ghibli interpretations of Ralph McQuarrie’s original sketches for Lucasfilm’s immortal sci-fi series. Peek within that frame and you’ll see rickety sci-fi vehicles and clunking robots that wouldn’t be out of place on the streets of Mos Eisley. Lend your ear to that scene, and the whirring sounds of those same droids and digitised radio chatter of enemy guards could easily be coming from R2-D2 and Stormtroopers, respectively. All of these aspects add up to something that is far more than referential, though, instead shaping a confident, expansive puzzle platformer sequel of its own original design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first things that hits you when booting up Planet of Lana 2 is the music. Again, the soaring of its strings and the twinkle of its brass conjure up strong images of a galaxy far, far away. But, this time, it shouldn’t come as a surprise — the sequel's score is once again composed by Star Wars: The Clone Wars orchestrator, Takeshi Furukawa. Incidentally, he’s also behind the music of The Last Guardian, a game that greatly inspired Wishfully, the small Swedish developer behind Planet of Lana 2. It carries on that same “child on a dangerous, yet wondrous adventure with a fantasy animal companion” legacy, this time with a darker tone as shades of Limbo and Inside come to the fore.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2.5D stealth-puzzle-platforming takes place on a bigger canvas compared to its 2023 predecessor. Two years after the events of that game, protagonist Lana has settled back into family life on the planet of Novo, though clearly mystery and intrigue still remain, both on its surface and bubbling below it. After a short tutorial section investigating the corpse of the hulking spaceship that brought her people to this new land, Lana’s sister is taken ill, and you’re promptly sent on a mission to hunt down rare ingredients for a remedy. This journey takes Lana to new regions of the world, which gives Wishfully’s art team new scope to stretch their creative muscles, but also presents welcome new ideas when it comes to puzzle design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A now older, more confident Lana is more agile than before, able to slide under low-hanging metal for quick escapes and even dive into the ocean to solve whatever conundrums its depths are hiding. Lighter on her feet this time around, she’s practically a backflip and a handstand away from moving more like a Lara than a Lana. Whether clambering through caverns or broaching darkened mine shafts, platforming is more about patience and precision than speed and reflexes. The sequel’s expanded vision also extends to the framing of its puzzles, with larger areas demanding further exploration of the scene – you must look for helpful items in areas high above and further off-screen than you might expect.</p><p>There’s a great sense of tactility to every heavy lever pull, as heavy machinery and hulking robots lurch and creak.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, many of the challenges I faced through this two-hour demonstration were largely the sort of combat-avoidant stealth sequences that reward patience – as in, you must remain motionless while waiting for obstacles to morph into the required shape, or for enemies to turn the other way, creating a safe passage through. I would never say this becomes tedious, but for those who prefer a bit more zip and thrust to their action, here's a heads up that I wouldn’t necessarily expect that here. To those who didn’t play the original Planet of Lana, it’s much closer to a Little Nightmares than it is to a Metroid in its level design and enemy encounters. But similar to Samus’ space adventures, there’s a great sense of tactility to every heavy lever pull, as heavy machinery and hulking robots lurch and creak inside a mountain facility, dwarfing Lana and her even smaller, spherical companion, Mui. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This little ball of charm provides a furry edge to many of Planet of Lana 2's puzzles, with their newly increased ability set adding welcome extra variety to the mix alongside their existing skillset. I particularly enjoyed further explorations of  Mui’s somewhat telepathic ability to control creatures around the world of Novo. For example, fish can be sent to zip around and deploy clouds of ink that masks the vision of larger-finned foes, and sticky balls of blob can create trails of sludge that transform into paths of fire to remove flammable obstructions. These fuse-like puzzles, which task you with examining the level geography as you trace its edges to reach your goal, were some of my favourites in this preview demo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Planet of Lana 2 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I’ve only seen around a third of the game, even at this early stage, I am wary that some mechanics are already on the edge of being used one too many times, threatening to turn some brainteasers into busywork. But, largely on the whole, the puzzles have proven fun and fair, compelling me to pause and think, but never to the detriment of the momentum of the story. It fits the urgency of the tale being told, with many mysteries lurking in the background. It's this intrigue that drove me through these early hours on the path to discovery, as well as the distinct sense of adventure as you hop around this thoroughly alien planet, painted with beautiful art and soundtracked by a sensational score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Star Wars does with its flashy lightsaber duels and thrilling space battles, Planet of Lana never forgets to put character front and centre, even in its puzzles. Reassuring nods and moments of murmur in an alien tongue help solidify the bond between Lana and her furry friend, all while keeping the story of their adventure foremost in mind. And, just like The Empire Strikes Back, Planet of Lana 2 teases in these early hours that it’s certainly not afraid to enter darker territory on a grander scale, whilst leaving plenty of time for those smaller moments. It’s all very promising, and a reassuring sign that the heart of its short and sweet predecessor is being carried over into this expanded, more ambitious sequel on March 5th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Because Van Buren would have been set in post-apocalyptic Colorado, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">which is exactly where Amazon’s Fallout TV series is headed for Season 3</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: The New West aims to adapt the core narrative threads of Van Buren and turn them into a fully playable story built in the New Vegas engine. Expect modern gameplay systems, expanded roleplaying opportunities, and “the mechanical depth and tone that defined classic Fallout,” the modders said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made total conversion mod for Fallout: New Vegas. In many ways, it tells the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience. The project’s primary narrative goal is to take the disparate plot threads and unfinished concepts found in the original design documents, including for example, the NCR–Brotherhood conflict, the Great Tribal War between Caesar’s Legion and the Daughters of Hecate, the fight for the soul of the Mormon State and much more, and weave them into a satisfying, unified narrative that adheres to the main plot as described in the design documents.</blockquote><blockquote>Players assume the role of a new protagonist, released from captivity in 2253, known as “the Prisoner,” and the story is set in an alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas. Unfortunately due to many Van Buren concepts being folded into FNV, we cannot set the project in the same timeline. Our secondary goal is to incorporate many of the modern gameplay conveniences introduced through Fallout: New Vegas and its more than 15 years of modding, while preserving the distinctive mechanics and design quirks of classic Fallout found in the original design documents. Much of Fallout’s original charm is an acquired taste, and one that we believe remains worth acquiring.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Fallout Stories For the Amazon Show</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds exciting, and given the success of Fallout: London, which had Bethesda’s blessing, it may even have a chance of survival. Indeed, a new demo is apparently due out soon (an initial demo, which released under the name Fallout Revelation Blues, came out last year). This alternate start demo under the new name of Fallout: The New West will be followed up with the entirety of Act 1 of the game as a vertical slice, the modders said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fallout: The New West does make it to release, it will see Van Buren realized — albeit in fan-made form — 20 years after it fell by the wayside. In 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-creator-tim-cain-reveals-involvement-in-cancelation-of-original-fallout-3">Fallout creator Tim Cain revealed new information on how it ended up canceled amid significant financial problems at Interplay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cain, who worked on the first two, much-loved Fallout games in the mid-to late 90s before leaving Interplay to start a new studio called Troika Games, revealed that in the middle of 2003, an unnamed Interplay vice president asked him to play the Van Buren prototype, saying: “I don’t think they can get it done, so I’m just going to cancel it. But if you look over it and give me an estimate there’s a chance I wouldn’t cancel it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cain said he played the prototype for two hours and asked the development team a number of questions before delivering his verdict to the vice president. “I said, ‘I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped.’ And he said, ‘huh, could it be done any faster?’ And I was like, 'oh, shoot, I’ve said too long.' I said, ‘well, even if you did a death march crunch I don’t think you could do it faster than 12, and then you’d be shipping something that was unbalanced and buggy, and the team would be destroyed. So I don’t recommend that.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And he said, ‘OK, thanks.’ As we walked out he basically explained any answer over six months was going to result in him having to cancel it, meaning the answer I just gave got the game canceled. But he was going to cancel it anyway. He thought it couldn’t be done in six months, and I just confirmed that to him.”</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Cain, the cancellation of Van Buren was, ultimately, about money; Interplay’s dire financial situation meant it simply did not have enough cash to fund more than six months of further development. Interplay went on to close Black Isle Studios and cut its entire staff. The company released the console spinoff Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in 2004 for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but it was not enough. That same year, Interplay announced a licensing deal with The Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda for future Fallout games, and in 2007, Interplay sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda outright. The rest is history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re wondering about the Fallout TV show’s journey to Colorado, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-the-wasteland-where-you-always-get-sidetracked-by-bullst-every-goddamn-time-fallout-showrunner-teases-non-linear-journey-to-new-season-3-location">check out what co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet and even Todd Howard himself have had to say about it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
