            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>On our recent expedition to the Tokyo Game Show, one of the most intriguing games we came across was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4131220/AKIBA_LOST/">AKIBA Lost</a>. This adventure game is set to revitalise the FMV genre, with over 20 hours of live-action footage and more than 100,000 images designed to build up a branching narrative where you take control. We were able to catch up with director Shinsuke Umeda as well as members of the cast, and we got to talk through this remarkable project.</p>
<p>AKIBA Lost is undoubtedly a post-modern production, a video game about video game development. Focusing on ‘genius creator’ Daiki Shinjo, he announces that he will produce a game based on a mysterious incident from the past where six girls went missing in Tokyo shopping district, Akihabara.</p>
<p><iframe title="AKIBA LOSTショートPV-新城大輝 / 北山宏光編-" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKxiI4O3nr0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The cast of the game includes Aoi Shinjo (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura) as a maid, Yukimi Kurahashi (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe), who appears as a game streamer, Moe Kurosu (portrayed by Misato Ugaki) who’s a gourmet writer, Kokone Nagato (portrayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48) an underground idol, Chihiro Jimbo (portrayed by Azusa Ohara) a Shrine maiden and Wakana Yusa (portrayed by MINA) who takes on the role of a cosplayer. Umeda states, “The characters that you meet in this game represent different aspects of Japanese culture. So the people who play, not only get to know more about Japan, but I’m certain that they will also grow to love it.”</p>
<p>The mystery begins when Aoi disappears, and a phone call brings a terrifying warning, telling Shinjo to stop the production, or else the tragedy will repeat itself. It’s immediately a compelling mystery, and one that feels as though it will really resonate with gamers, especially as the team at IzanagiGames are targeting production values far higher than we’ve seen for this type of game before. That’s helped by the involvement of Nippon Television Network Corporation and Nippon Television AX-ON Inc., whose expertise in TV production is set to make this one of the best-looking live footage games we’ve ever seen.</p>

<div id="attachment_465562"><p id="caption-attachment-465562">Narrative choices –&nbsp;Yukimi Kurahashi portrayed by Momoko Tanabe</p></div>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the game is the fact that it has a branching narrative. Players will be able to make their own choices, and through a single run, you’ll likely experience a very different story to someone else. The team hoped that players would want to complete multiple runs through the game to see everything, and explore each character’s full arc too, especially as there is the potential for unexpected outcomes. Umeda said, “There are possibilities that some choices you make with one character affects their timeline but there is also a possibility that a choice you made with another character has an influence on somebody else. So you could end up stopping a timeline because of a choice.”</p>
<p>Players will ‘zap’ between the seven central characters, allowing them to build up a wider understanding of the events as they unfold, by seeing it from multiple perspectives. It sounds thoroughly intriguing, and with the TV-like framing for the live-action, there’s every chance that Akiba Lost will feel utterly unique.</p>
<p>When asked how much of his own experiences as a developer were being brought into the game, director Shinsuke Umeda stated,”100%”, continuing, “That’s because the circumstances are special, it’s a game about a game creator, making a game. As a game director, I don’t think that there would be circumstances that could relate to your own self so much!”</p>
<p>The cast were similarly forthcoming about their involvement in the game, and in its choice-based systems, with Yui Oguri saying, “It’s difficult to imagine how it feels to be a virtual character, and someone else controlling you, because it’s not something that’s normally done.” Azusa Ohara continued, “There are patterns to things that can happen, so it’s fun to see which person does what and how their character reacts accordingly.”</p>
<div id="attachment_465561"><p id="caption-attachment-465561">Moe Kurosu (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)</p></div>
<p>Misato Ugaki said, “I’ve grown up seeing games, Pokémon, Zelda, a variety of games, but it’s the first time I’ve been asked to be in one. It was definitely an exhilarating request, but, at the same time, new. It’s something I’ve grown up watching, and now I get to be in it!”</p>
<p>It was interesting to discover that the majority of the cast were also gamers themselves, giving them an insight and affection for the format and subject matter of AKIBA Lost that other actors may not have. It’s an eclectic mix too, from MINA, who plays Fortnite, to Misato Ugaki who cited Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as her favourite. Azusa Ohara loved Hogwarts Legacy, but perhaps the person most in tune with the direction of AKIBA Lost will be Sayuri Matsumura, whose love for the classic Super Nintendo Visual Novel, Banshee’s Last Cry, seems like an ideal person to test out the game she’s starring in.</p>

<p>One of the clearest things from our time with the cast and director was how much fun everyone seemed to be having. While they’ve all worked on various projects, none of the cast have ever done anything like this before, and while some of the technical details made filming harder – the camera captured both the live action footage and the still images at the same time – it seemed that everyone was fully invested in the opportunity, and the possibilities that this format could bring.</p>
<p>AKIBA Lost is clearly an ambitious project, but after talking to the cast and team behind it, they’re clearly putting everything they have into it, from both a technical standpoint, and a personal one. If you’re a fan of visual novels, this might be a refreshing alternative, and a potential first step into a new and revitalised FMV genre.</p>

<p>Thought Nintendo had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>? Think again! December's big release has just landed a brand-new trailer titled 'Survive' and, expectedly, it's still looking awesome.</p>
<p>Now, the trailer itself is only a little over a minute long, and you will have seen a lot of the footage before, but there are still some brief new snippets for those who have been going through every previous reveal with a fine-tooth comb.</p>
<p>We get a glimpse at some cool-looking psychic platforms, mysterious jungle vehicles, cutscene dogfights and more of that open desert area that we know we'll be speeding around on Vi-O-La. There's also a slightly different look at a fight with a pack of wolves, plenty of dramatic locales and Samus doing yet another <strong>Akira</strong> slide — because we can never get enough of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>In short, things are still being kept pretty securely under wraps — hey, it's not like the game comes out <em>one month today</em> or anything... What we do know is that the long-awaited adventure is looking mighty fine. Let's just keep those fingers crossed that it can live up to the anticipation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new Game Ready driver for its GeForce graphics cards. This one is optimized for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, by far the biggest release scheduled this month. The game will launch on November 14, with Activision <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding itself in a bit of a pinch</a> following the releases of two highly successful shooters: Battlefield 6 and ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The new Game Ready driver is also optimized for Europa Universalis V, the latest entry (following a hiatus of twelve years) in Paradox Interactive's premier grand strategy game. Europa Universalis V is out today on PC and will support DLSS Super Resolution with the option to enable the latest transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, the Game Ready driver is optimized for Ubisoft's Anno 117: Pax Romana, a real-time strategy game with city building elements. The game will debut on November 13 with support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Wreckreation, a massive open world racing game focused on destruction, launched a week ago with support for DLSS Super Resolution and optional transformer model via the NVIDIA app. Earlier in October, indie developer Jaw Drop Games released Deathground, a co-op horror game where players desperately try to survive against dinosaurs. Deathground supports DLSS 4 with Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Square Enix will update Final Fantasy VII Rebirth today with DLSS Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation, accelerating frame rates in the popular action RPG for owners of GeForce RTX 40 and 50 Series GPUs. The game already features DLSS Super Resolution, but it will now be upgradable to the new transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p>Lastly, on November 6, Finnish developer Channel37 will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783560/The_Last_Caretaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch The Last Caretaker in early access</a>. This is a first-person survival crafting game where players step into the role of a machine tasked with securing humanity's future after a cataclysm that has flooded the Earth. Players will navigate a dangerous ocean world to salvage technology that could save humankind. The game will support the full NVIDIA DLSS 4 suite: Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. </p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warframe/">Warframe</a> will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 next year, but the longer wait will be worth it, according to the developer.</p>



<p>In a new livestream, Digital Extremes confirmed that the Switch 2 native version of their popular game will launch sometime in 2026, disappointing those who had hoped the game would debut on the current-generation Nintendo console before the end of 2025. Although a precise release window hasn't been confirmed, the developer did specifiy they will release the game as early as they possibly can in the new year.</p>



<p>No matter how long the wait will be, it looks like it will be worth it. During the livestream, Digital Extremes shared new footage of the Nintendo Switch 2 version running in handheld mode with NVIDIA DLSS on, and it looks quite promising. Unfortunately, the developer didn't discuss specifics such as resolution and frame rate targets, so there's still a lot we don't know about this new version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Those who wish to play Warframe on the Nintendo Switch 2 and cannot wait for the native version to be released have the option of playing the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nintendo.com/it-it/Giochi/Giochi-scaricabili-per-Nintendo-Switch/Warframe-1471859.html?srsltid=AfmBOopA0r6U6DlySfK3HhSAXcOWeZm6NLLExXaaaCbPqv7KSUGTVJuy">original Switch release</a> via backward compatibility. This version of the game doesn't look or run great, however, so those looking to have the best possible experience will inevitabily have to wait for the new version to launch. Hopefully, it won't take too long.</p>

            <p>"In a decaying society, art, if it is truthful, must also reflect decay," Austrian journalist and Marxist Ernst Fischer wrote in The Necessity of Art. "And unless it wants to break faith with its social function, art must show the world as changeable. And help to change it." I can't help but feel he'd very much appreciate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>'s fourth early access update, which has added in a tool you can use to brush detailed rust, dirt, and dents onto the canvas of your old banger.

<p>Yep, developers Bugbear have finally made the destructive racer's car customisation more detailed than just picking a colour. CRAP-IT looks to work like your standard livery editor, but with a fitting focus on weathering effects that go beyond your usual set of stickers and paints. That said, you can still paste decals all over your ride and skimp on the rust if you're allergic to driving anything that looks like it belongs in a scrapyard.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm just glad to see Wreckfest 2's car customisation starting to take shape, as it's been one element missing as Bugbear have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-early-access-review">assembled a fun racing chassis</a> and begun to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-2-adds-new-cars-and-muddy-tracks-with-more-planned-next-month">bolt more cars and tracks onto it</a>.</p>
<p>On the topic of cars and tracks, this update adds in possibly the most important demo derby combatant of them all - the Volkswagen Beetle-esque Buggy. Ferdinand Porsche might be more well known for rear-engined sportscars, but damn could he and the likes of Hungarian engineer Béla Barényi design a car that's fun to lob around like a concrete egg on wheels to the exetent you sort of forget <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g15378761/volkswagen-beetle-models-by-year/">its origin</a> as a people's car envisioned by the Nazis. To be fair, I think slamming it around a track like Crash Canyon 2.0 counts as giving the moustache bloke the middle finger, give fascism's notorious disapproval of hairpins and head-on collisions that waste metal which could instead be used to prop up a far-right, authoritarian, and ultranationalist state.</p><p>Beyond these additions, Bugbear have also revamped how the game simulates tyres, as well as suspension and how cars deform when bashed into things. You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/600793783198549313?l=english">full notes</a> if you're keen to know the full bug fix rundown.</p>
<p>I'm off to wonder how I've managed to shoehorn references to two political schools of thought into an article about cars going vroom vroom, then smash. Then I'll go and spend three hours spelling out the word 'boom' in rusty dents.</p>

Its success has prompted it to cross over with all sorts of games, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/impressions/2024/05/10/vampire-survivors-contra-dlc-shows-one-of-gamings-best-values-still-has" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffd11bbf-fa2a-4f83-9a24-4aeea4fea496" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Contra</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/vampire-survivors-announces-crossover-with-square-enixs-saga-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9b63d83c-34e6-4574-a933-19ef91aa2246" data-entity-substitution="canonical">SaGa</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/vampire-survivors-balatro-update-is-out-today-alongside-more-castlevania-content-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fed2db4-75fb-4ae3-9c71-2ccfd7861673" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Balatro</a>, and Castlevania, but today we learned of the first fully new game to take the formula and run: Warhammer Survivors.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's exactly what it sounds like. The standalone game stars characters from Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar in the classic Vampire Survivors format, complete with hordes of enemies, simple, pixelated graphics, and treasure chests that make you feel like you hit the jackpot in Vegas. The game is not developed by Poncle, which created the original Vampire Survivors, but by Auroch Digital, the developer of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun, using Poncle's engine.</p><p>Warhammer Survivors content is pretty evenly divided between the world of 40,000 and Age of Sigmar, with several maps, weapons, and characters from each universe. According to a press release, the characters revealed so far include Malum Caedo, Cadian Shock Trooper Kozlowski, Space Marine Intercessor Brother Luca, Neave Blacktalon, Gotrek Gurnisson, and Stormcast Eternal Vanquisher Sharynn Azurwrath. Each character comes with unique abilities and a different starting weapon, which include the Boltgun, Astartes Chainsword, and Whirlwind Axes.</p><p>Warhammer Survivors is set to launch next year.

		<p>Firaxis has announced that it is now rolling out update 1.3.0 for Civilization VII, and this update primarily focuses on the sea and oceans. It includes the new Harbor building unit, the Privateer unit for all civilisations, changes to naval combat, and more resources in the ocean. Alongside this, the Tides of Power Collection is available to download for free until January 5th, giving access to Edward Teach, Republic of Pirates, and Tonga today, and while in December players will be able to get the Sayyida al Hurra, Ottomans, and Iceland content packs in-game.</p>

<p><b>Gameplay</b></p>
<p><b>Buildings &amp; Units</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Building: Harbor</b>
<ul>
<li>The Harbor is an Antiquity Age Warehouse Water Building available to all civs that unlocks on Sailing.
<ul>
<li>As a Water Building, it can be placed only in Coastal and Navigable River tiles. It has the same placement restrictions as a Fishing Quay.</li>
<li>Like other Warehouse Buildings, the Harbor is available in Towns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It provides +1 base Production, and a +1 Production Warehouse bonus on Fishing Boats.</li>
<li>Naval Units will default to spawning on the Harbor, similar to the Barracks for land Units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Unit: Privateer</b>
<ul>
<li>The Privateer is an Exploration Age Light Naval Unit available to all civs that unlocks on Heraldry. It is a melee-focused Unit, with very weak ranged and bombard attacks.</li>
<li>The Privateer has the Pirate ability (see below for details). Additionally, when the Privateer kills a Unit, it gains 100% of its Combat Strength as Gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Unit Ability: Pirate</b>
<ul>
<li>The Pirate ability allows the following:
<ul>
<li>Units can cross borders of other civs without Open Borders, Alliance, or War.</li>
<li>Units can Plunder Trade Routes between non-Allied civs without War.
<ul>
<li>Plundering a Trade Route this way causes a slight reduction in Relationship with the civ the Trader belonged to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Units can attack non-Allied Units without War.
<ul>
<li>Defeating a Unit this way causes a slight reduction in Relationship with the civ the Unit belonged to. Attacking an Independent Power this way causes them to become Hostile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b>AI</b></p>
<ul>
<li>AI now fully uses all Sanctions against other players, including other AI players.</li>
<li>When an AI proposal to form an alliance is accepted, the alliance is now properly created between the two leaders.</li>
<li>AI no longer fails to use the Establish Air Base Ability when progressing through a game in the Modern Age.</li>
<li>AI no longer fails to attack Air Bases with Air Units when establishing an Air Base near the AI’s Settlement during Modern Age Gameplay.</li>
<li>AI now more consistently builds naval Units.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where AI would not properly select Celebrations.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where AI players could still receive free walls in multiple Settlements when a custom difficulty game sets free walls to 0.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Combat</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(★ – Community Influenced Item)&nbsp;<b>Naval Combat Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>The Cog (Exploration Unit) now has a range of 2, increased from 1.</li>
<li>Light and Heavy Naval Units are more distinct. This applies to both Exploration and Modern.
<ul>
<li>Light Naval Units are now primarily melee Units with very weak ranged and bombard strength. They have increased movement and sight compared to the Heavy Naval Units in their Age, and can benefit from flanking when attacking. Light Units take reciprocal damage when attacking.
<ul>
<li>The new Privateer Unit in Exploration is a Light Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Light Naval Units in Modern have had their ranged and bombard strength reduced by 20 to better fit their role as melee Units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heavy Naval Units are now primarily ranged Units. Their melee strength has been reduced by 5, and their ranged and bombard strength have increased by 5. Like other ranged Units, Heavy Units don’t take reciprocal damage when attacking.</li>
<li>Civ Unique Naval Units have been adjusted to keep their relative strength compared to the Unit they replaced in that Age.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Submarines (Modern Unit) are now ranged Units with an increased ranged strength of 70 and a reduced melee strength of 50. Previously they had a base strength of 65. They can no longer attack Districts or land Units.</li>
<li>The Fleet Commander’s Focus Fire and Coordinated Attack should now utilize Heavy and Light Units respectively. Light Naval Units should not be included in a Focus Fire, and Heavy Naval Units should not be included in a Coordinated Attack.
<ul>
<li>Privateers and Units with the Pirate ability will not participate in a Coordinated Attack or Focus Fire command while not at war.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note</b>: We made this decision to keep combat rules consistent and prevent bigger issues with how wars are handled. We’ll keep listening to feedback on this for future improvements!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Other Combat Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>Trench Fighters and Dive Bomber Units have had their Bombard Strength reduced, and Bomber and Heavy Bomber Units have had their Ranged Strengths reduced, to make the air Units fit better into their intended roles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Environment</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Terrain: Atolls and Lotus</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Atolls:&nbsp;</b>Atolls are a Feature that can appear on Ocean tiles. They stop movement for Units, and have a combat defense bonus for Units on the Atoll. Their Yields when worked are:
<ul>
<li><b>Exploration:</b>&nbsp;1 Food, 2 Production, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Modern:</b>&nbsp;1 Food, 2 Production, 2 Culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Lotus:</b>&nbsp;Lotus is a Feature that can appear on Lake tiles. They replace Reef tiles that previously appeared in Lakes. Their Yields when worked are:
<ul>
<li><b>Antiquity</b>: 1 Food, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Exploration</b>: 2 Food, 1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Modern</b>: 2 Food, 2 Culture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Terrain Updates</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Reefs:</b>&nbsp;Reefs no longer spawn in Lakes. They are now exclusively in Coastal tiles that are not Lakes. Their Yields when worked have been updated:
<ul>
<li><b>Antiquity</b>: 1 Food, 1 Production, 1 Science</li>
<li><b>Exploration</b>: 1 Food, 2 Production, 1 Science</li>
<li><b>Modern</b>: 1 Food, 2 Production, 2 Science</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Ocean:</b>&nbsp;Ocean tiles are now workable by all civs in the Modern Age and provide 1 Food and 3 Gold.</li>
<li><b>Grand Canyon:</b>&nbsp;The Grand Canyon now gives 1 Science on Flat tiles, from 2 previously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(★)&nbsp;<b>Auto Explore and Discoveries</b>
<ul>
<li>When clicking on Units with Auto Explore, Discoveries are now highlighted in blue to improve readability.</li>
<li>The automated exploration ability can no longer be activated when the Unit is within range of being able to reach a discovery (within 2 turns of movement).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Economy</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thành Huế no longer requires Flat terrain.</li>
<li>Sawmill no longer requires River placement.</li>
<li>Trade Route Range is no longer ignored when Forming an Alliance with the Kolp’um Civic researched as Silla during Antiquity Age.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Independent Powers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Independent Powers no longer spawn more Units than expected when performing Incite Raid in early Antiquity.</li>
<li>Festival Ground now specifies that it needs to be placed on an existing improvement in the choose bonus menu.</li>
<li>Independent Power Carracks no longer receive Rough Seas damage when they move into Open Ocean tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Modern Social Policy, Monopolies, to provide +5 Gold in Settlements with a Factory. (<i>Previously: +3)</i></li>
<li>Updated Dell’Arte della Guerra Memento to provide +3 Gold per Sanction you have active per Age. (<i>Previously: +5 Gold per Sanction you have active per Age.)</i></li>
<li>Made improvements to the first-time user experience for Unique Buildings.</li>
<li>Addressed a reported issue where the player could be prevented from interacting with their Founder when putting the Founder to sleep while Auto End turn is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Military</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(★) Commanders no longer consume all movement points when deploying all Units.</li>
<li>Splash damage reduced from 50% to 25% on Fleet and Squadron Trees.</li>
<li>Commander’s Coordinated attack no longer fails to work when individually unpacking with ‘Initiative’.</li>
<li>Commander Units in process of respawning no longer appear as an available choice when opening the “Levy Unit” menu from a Suzerain City-State.</li>
<li>Ottru Units no longer fail to receive any active Naval Unit bonuses.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Resources&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Updated Resource Generation:</b>
<ul>
<li>(★) Resources should be more consistent between Ages now. If a resource is not generated in an Age, it will not appear suddenly in future Ages, nor will it disappear for an Age and then come back. For example, if you didn’t see Turtles in Antiquity, they will not appear in Exploration.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>We’ve gotten feedback that changing resources between Ages can be frustrating. While we like that the world changes a little between Ages and makes you reevaluate the map, this was a good spot to improve the experience and address some of the feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maps will now have a guaranteed minimum of 3 different Coastal Resources, with a chance for more.
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;This should make those hidden Whales start appearing in more games!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Age Transitioning, maps will now have at least 1 new Resource introduced in that Age. For example, transitioning to Exploration would guarantee at least one Resource new to Exploration, like Whales, Niter, or the new Pitch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>New Resources:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Crabs</b>: Appears on Coastal and Lake tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Food</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +2 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +3 Food on Warehouse Buildings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Cowrie:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Coastal tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Happiness</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +4 Gold in Cities, +2 Science in Towns</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +5 Gold in Cities, +3 Science in Towns</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +6 Gold in Cities, +4 Science in Towns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Turtles:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Coastal tiles.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Culture</li>
<li><b>Antiquity (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Culture on Warehouse Buildings</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +2 Culture on Warehouse Buildings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Pitch:</b>&nbsp;Appears on Vegetated tiles in Grassland, Plains, and Tundra.
<ul>
<li><b>Tile Yield</b>: +1 Production, +1 Gold</li>
<li><b>Exploration (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Gold on Water Buildings</li>
<li><b>Modern (Bonus Resource)</b>: +1 Production on Factories, +10% Production towards constructing Factories in all Settlements when slotted.</li>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;With Pitch, we’re experimenting with new design space for Resources. The Resource is harder to use, requiring specific Buildings and may not be active until late in an Age, but its tile has increased Yield compared to other Resources. Let us know what you think!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Leaders &amp; Civs</b></h2>
<h2>Civs</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Achaemenid Persia</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Persia is a beloved civ, but we got enough feedback that they felt weak in areas outside of combat that we wanted to buff them. Now, they have increased Culture from their Unique Improvements, as well as a little more healing. Finally, we renamed them to better clarify their identity as the Achaemenids.</li>
<li><b>Pairidaeza</b>: +2 Culture and +1 Gold. +5 Healing for Military Units in a Settlement with a Pairidaeza. Cannot be adjacent to another Pairidaeza.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Culture and Gold. Cannot be adjacent to another Pairidaeza.)</i></li>
<li><b>Satrapies (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Settlement Limit. The Pairidaeza gets +1 Culture and +1 Happiness from adjacent Quarters.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Settlement Limit. The Pairidaeza gets +1 Happiness from adjacent Quarters.)</i></li>
<li><b>Baziš (Tier 1)</b>: +5 Gold, +2 Happiness and +2 Culture for every different civilization you have captured a Settlement from.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Achaemenid Empire: +5 Gold for every different civilization you have captured a Settlement from.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Aksum</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Aksum’s changes are a good example of our new approach of giving stronger bonuses on narrower effects. By leaning into the emphasis on Coastal Settlements, we get to buff the numbers of some of the abilities. Remember, a Coastal Settlement is a Settlement with its City Center adjacent to the Coast.</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: +3 Gold on Resources in Coastal Settlements.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +2 Gold on Resources.)</i></li>
<li><b>Tankwa</b>: Added +2 Gold from this Trade Route.</li>
<li><b>Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Gold on Districts adjacent to Coast. Port of Nations Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Gold on Quarters adjacent to Coast. Port of Nations Tradition.)</i></li>
<li><b>Monumentum Adulitanum (Tier 1)</b>: Culture and Happiness Buildings gain a +1 Culture Adjacency for Hawilti&nbsp;<i>(Previously: The Altar and Monument gain a Culture Adjacency with Hawilti.)</i></li>
<li><b>Book of the Himyarites</b>&nbsp;<b>(Tier 1)</b>: Gain a free Merchant. The Dhow gets +1 Movement and ignores Zone of Control. May This Please the People Tradition.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: The Dhow gets the Swift keyword (ignore ZoC). May This Please the People Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Chola</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>Chola only needed a little reinforcement of its identity as a Diplomatic civ, so we added some Influence generation to their kit.</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: Added +3 Gold and +1 Influence on Trade Routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Egypt</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;We got a lot of feedback that Egypt offered an exciting gameplay style (focusing on Wonders) but often failed to deliver, or was rough to transition into Exploration and onward. We leaned heavily into the Desert and Navigable River theme, and gave Egypt some hefty buffs.</li>
<li><b>Gifts of Osiris</b>: +2 Production on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Gifts of Osiris: +1 Production on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Riches of the Duat</b>: +15% Production towards Wonders, doubled for Wonders in Desert Terrain. +2 Production on Wonders in Desert Terrain.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +15% Production towards Wonders.)</i></li>
<li><b>Mastaba</b>: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles and Navigable Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles.)</i></li>
<li><b>Mortuary Temple</b>: Gold base. +1 Happiness adjacency for Navigable Rivers. +1 Culture Adjacency for Wonders.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Culture base. +1 Gold adjacency for Desert tiles and Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Light of Amun-Ra (Tier 1)</b>: +2 Gold and +2 Culture on the Palace and Wonders. +1 Settlement Limit. Kemet Tradition. Pyramids Wonder.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +5 Gold on the Palace. +1 Settlement Limit. Kemet Tradition. Pyramids Wonder.)</i></li>
<li><b>Akhet</b>: +2 Food on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.<i>&nbsp;(Previously: +1 Food on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
<li><b>Kemet</b>: +1 Culture on Improvements and Districts on Navigable and Minor Rivers.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: +1 Culture on Navigable Rivers.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Great Britain:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;We tried to limit the nerfs in this pass to individual effects that were overperforming. With the increased use of Towns and more Warehouses available, this effect had to change.</li>
<li><b>East India Company</b>: +5 Gold in Towns. (<i>Previously: +3 Gold on each Building in Towns.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Hawai’i:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Unique Ability</b>: Can work Ocean tiles. Ocean tiles have 1 Food and 2 Gold. Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to Marine Terrain. +1 Happiness on all Marine Terrain. (<i>Previously: Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to a Marine Tile. +1 Happiness on Fishing Boats.)</i></li>
<li><b>Leiomano</b>:<b>&nbsp;</b>+5 defense against Heavy Naval Units.</li>
<li><b>Lo’I Kalo</b>: +3 Food. +2 Production. Receives +1 Culture from each adjacent Fishing Boat. Can only be placed in the Grassland and Tropical Biomes. (<i>Previously: Lo’I Kalo: +3 Food. +2 Production. Adjacent Farms receive +1 Culture. Can only be placed in the Grassland and Tropical Biomes.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Maya</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Rain of Chaac (Tier 1)</b>: Unlock the K’uh Nah. The Altar gains +2 Science if placed on a Vegetated Tile. Pet Kot Tradition. (<i>Previously: Unlock the K’uh Nah. The Altar gains +1 Science Adjacency for Vegetated tiles. Pet Kot Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mississippian</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:</b>&nbsp;Like the change to Great Britain, we had to make some tweaks to what was probably the strongest Tradition in the game.</li>
<li><b>Shell-Tempered Pottery</b>: Food, Gold, and Warehouse Buildings gain a +1 Gold Adjacency for Resources.&nbsp;<i>(Previously: Buildings gain a +1 Gold Adjacency for Resources.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Prussia</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Ruhr (Tier 2)</b>: +1 Science on Resources. Coking Tradition. (<i>Previously +2 Science on Resources. Coking Tradition.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Qing</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Kang Qian Shèngshì:</b>&nbsp;+4 Gold, +4 Culture, +2 Influence, but -4 Science per Trade Route. (<i>Previously: +4 Gold, +3 Culture, +2 Influence, but -1 Science from Imported Resources.)</i></li>
<li><b>Open Customs (Tier 1)</b>: Unlock the Qianzhuang. +1 Culture for every imported Resource. Cohong Tradition. +1 Settlement Limit. (<i>Previously: +2 Culture for every imported Resource. Cohong Tradition. +1 Settlement Limit.)</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Songhai</b>:
<ul>
<li><b>Dev Note:&nbsp;</b>Songhai, like Egypt, was a civ that promised a cool gameplay niche (Navigable Rivers and Homelands Treasure) but fell short of exciting in a few ways. We made a lot of adjustments to their kit to improve their gameplay throughout the Age.</li>

</ul>
<h2><b>Content Collection</b></h2>
<h2>Leaders</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added new leader Edward Teach.</b></p>

<p>Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate whose name sparked dread in the captains of the Caribbean. In 1716, he joined the crew of Benjamin Hornigold, a leader of the Flying Gang, and quickly gained his own ships. With his impressive height, his long beard (decorated with, at times, lit fuses), and reputation for violence, he stalked the sea-lanes of the Caribbean and the nightmares of sailors. He outlived the Flying Gang and moved his operation to the Outer Banks of present-day North Carolina, where a pirate hunter, Robert Maynard, finally caught up with him.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Militaristic, Economic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Blackbeard</b>: All Naval Units gain the Pirate Ability, allowing them to cross borders of other civilizations, Plunder Trade Routes from non-Allied civilizations, and attack Naval Units of non-Allied civilizations without declaring war. Defeating any Naval Units with your own Naval Units provides Gold equal to a set percentage of its Combat Strength and captures that Unit. Increased Gold maintenance costs for all Naval Units.</li>
<li><b>Agenda – Queen Anne’s Revenge</b>: Increase Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that build Naval Units. Decrease Relationship by a Small Amount with Leaders that neglect to build Naval Units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Civilizations</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Exploration Age civilization Republic of Pirates.</b></p>

<p>Where there is wealth, there is greed. The scramble for new world riches in the early 18th century brought English, Spanish, French, and Dutch fleets – but the prospect of quick riches also brought pirates. These were rarely organized, but in 1706, one band, the Flying Gang, took over the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and set up a short-lived republic for all who sought fortune… and came with few scruples.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Economic, Militaristic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Flying Gang</b>: Increased Yields from Pillaging and Coastal Raiding with Naval Units. Settler Units cannot be trained or purchased, but you can capture other civilizations’ Settlers. Naval Units, Treasure Convoys, and Buccaneer Units can move into other civilizations’ borders without being at war or having Open Borders.</li>
<li><b>Unique Civilian Unit – Buccaneer</b>: Unique Commander Unit. Gains a set number of charges to use the ‘Raiding Party’ Action every set number of Promotions.
<ul>
<li><b>Action – Raiding Party</b>: Targets an adjacent Treasure Resource. This Settlement instantly spawns a Treasure Convoy under your control equal to the number of Treasure Resources; this does not reset until another Treasure Convoy is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Unique Military Unit – Sloop</b>: Unique Naval Unit (replaces Privateer). Can cross other civilizations’ borders, Pillage Trade Routes between non-Allied civilizations, and attack Units of non-Allied civilizations without going to war. Can move after attacking and has a set amount of Movement.</li>
<li><b>Associated Wonder – Havana Harbor</b>: Gold Base. This Settlement generates Treasure Convoys worth a set amount of Treasure Fleet points in the Exploration Age (effect scales based on game speed). Increased Economic Attribute. Must be built in Distant Lands on Coastal Tiles adjacent to non-Lake tiles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added a new Antiquity Age civilization Tonga.</b></p>

<p>Into the endless blue, in search of new lands on scattered islands, the Polynesians sailed, settling the island of Tonga nearly three thousand years ago. Around 1000 CE, though, came another expansion, the Tu’i Tonga Empire – a struggle for dominance, tribute, and fealty over the Pacific. The Tongan kings maintained this system of hierarchical lordship over the islands until it, too, splintered.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Expansionist, Diplomatic</li>
<li><b>Unique Ability – Lords of the South</b>: Increased Influence on City Halls and the Palace if adjacent to Coast tiles. Cannot incorporate City-States.</li>
<li><b>Unique Civilian Unit – Tehina</b>: Unique Scout Unit. Can enter Ocean tiles (without taking damage) and embark at the start of the Age. Cannot disembark in Distant Lands, but can use Coastal Raid on adjacent Discoveries.</li>
<li><b>Unique Military Unit – Kalia</b>: Increased Combat Strength against Districts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wonders</h2>
<p><b>(Tides of Power DLC**) Added four new Wonders:&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Great Lighthouse – Antiquity</b>
<ul>
<li>Gold Base. Grants a free Merchant when built. +15 Water Trade Route Range in all Settlements. +1 Sight to all Naval Units. Must be built on a Coast tile adjacent to Land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Nan Madol – Exploration</b>
<ul>
<li>Provides +3 Culture, +3 Production, and +3 Happiness on the Palace and City Hall on Islands (a landmass with a maximum of 15 tiles). Must be built in an Island City on Coast adjacent to Land</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Great Blue Hole – Natural Wonder</b>
<ul>
<li>+2 Science and +4 Happiness. Adjacent sea rural tiles receive +2 Culture. Placed on the Coast adjacent to 6 coast tiles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Mapu’a Vaea Blowholes – Natural Wonder</b>
<ul>
<li>+2 Production and +4 Happiness. +2 Culture to all Coastal land tiles in this Settlement. Impassable.</li>
<li>Placed on the Coast adjacent to Cliffs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">IGN</a>), the U.S. Patent Office boss John Squires (no, not quite The Stone Roses guitarist - close, though) has ordered the reexamination of Nintendo's “summon sub-character and let it fight” patent.</p>
<p>The patent was previously granted "without any objection" to Nintendo, though Squires points to two previous patents from Konami in 2002 and Nintendo itself in 2019 which may viewed as "prior art" references. Squires says that both are “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” while each “raises a substantial new question of patentability".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fylguht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>It's important to note that the reexamination doesn't necessarily mean that the patent will ultimately be rejected, but Games Fray writer Florian Mueller says that this is now "highly likely" given the circumstances. Mueller also says that the very nature of the reexamination "further undermines the credibility" of Nintendo's patent.</p>
<p>As for why this has occurred, Mueller surmises that it's likely a direct result of the public outrage that followed when news broke of Nintendo's patent submission. The article argues that "No system is perfect, which is why there must be processes in place to fix issues".</p>
<p>Mueller closes by stating that there will likely be no further developments in Nintendo's case against Palworld nor any of the patents that relate to it in this calendar year. Decisions will likely be made in 2026, however, particularly by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. Mueller states that, given all of the developments relating to this case, "It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose".</p>
<p>Nintendo had recently been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendos-pokemon-catching-related-patent-has-been-rejected-in-japan">dealt another legal blow</a> when its patent related to catching <strong>Pokémon</strong> was rejected in Japan due to lacking an "inventive step", and that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field".</p>
<p>Things may still sway in Nintendo's favour, but to say that this legal battle has been much more compelling than any of us has expected would be an understatement. We'll be keen to see how things shake out in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/aloft-preview-bloom-and-blight-update/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Aloft is a cozy-looking cooperative sandbox survival game from developer Astrolabe Interactive and publisher Funcom that’s been <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">out in early access since January 15, 2025. </a>While its v1.0 release isn’t on deck (at least based on what Astrolabe told me), the studio is getting ready to deliver a significant update with its Bloom &amp; Blight expansion.</p>



<p>Ahead of Bloom &amp; Blight’s release today, I got the chance to check out a short presentation from Astrolabe going over everything that’s new in this update and to see just how much of the game is being overhauled and revamped. Seemingly, it’s a lot.</p>



<p>To start, the highlights: a new world generation system, an entirely revamped progression system, a reworked restoration system, new tool and weapon tiers, two new corruption strains, and the addition of wind tunnels to help you travel faster across the sky.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's all together the biggest update that developer Astrolabe Interactive has pushed out to Aloft, with the top three highlights listed in the graphic above being the three biggest game-changers for players.</p>



<p>The new, revamped progression system adds research points to player progression and lets players spend earned research points however they like for their playstyle. The knowledge tree also now works with the points system, which overall gives you more freedom in the kind of survival experience you're building for yourself in Aloft.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reworked restoration of corrupted islands and Life Trees makes removing corruption more rewarding than before, particularly because when you've restored an island and removed all signs of corruption you now get access to the inner basin of Life Trees.</p>



<p>They're essentially mini underground areas for you to explore and gather more resources from, and add plenty of depth to the visual experience of Aloft as these great-looking underground areas to explore.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reworked restoration system also comes with improvements to the combat and additions to the kinds of corruption you can face, and the ability to better study the corruption so you can be better prepared to fight against it. </p>



<p>Studying and collecting samples from corruption anomalies, lost anchors, and knowledge stones all play into the new progression system and advance their various tech trees, which then lets you craft more complex contraptions to improve your islands and thrive instead of just survive in Aloft. Collecting them and more research and knowledge points also leads to better tools, which now have new tiers in the Bloom and Blight update.</p>



<p>Windstone and Serrated Bone tools do more damage and have larger areas of effect, with Serrated Bone tools now being the top tier for all tools, doing more damage than Windstone variants, while Windstone variants fall in between Serrated and regular stone tools.</p>

</figure>



<p>The two new kinds of corrupted enemies (shown in the third photo above) are Sportox and Floglade, which add new challenges for players, including spores that disable your glider for a short period of time, grounding you and forcing you to engage more directly with the combat.</p>



<p>And speaking of gliders, the last major highlight in this update is the inclusion of wind tunnels, which help you travel faster across the sky as you turn any island you want into a ship. You can try using your glider in wind tunnels, but your glider isn't built for it and you'll get much farther, much faster, by using them when piloting your island ships.</p>



<p>Overall, Aloft has changed a lot since it released in early access at the start of this year, and its Bloom and Blight update is the biggest one yet. Its changes feel foundational, like the early access period has taken a turn and more than a few strides towards its eventual v1.0 release.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though that release isn't on the immediate horizon, the roadmap shared by Astrolabe Interactive shows how Aloft will continue going through big changes, so big that, beginning with this update, it's a whole new version of the game. You can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/613178682495730920?l=english">access the version of the game that Aloft was before this update,</a> but the fact that it is now dubbed the 'Legacy' version is just another sign of how much has changed.</p>



<p>While it won't be this year, hopefully, we'll have a better idea as to when v1.0 is on its way by this time next year, if it hasn't already arrived.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The hack-and-slash <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074"><em>Warriors</em> spin-offs</a> on Nintendo Switch have been easy to skip. The arcade action can be fun and the character interactions rewarding for fans of the given franchise, but for the most part they’ve done little to break out of the fan service bubble. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> might be different. Early reviews suggest the <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> spin-off isn’t just a must-play for hardcore fans but a decent action game that new Switch 2 owners should be paying attention to.</p> <p>Out November 6 as an exclusive for Nintendo’s new hardware, the Koei Tecmo-developed musou game is the first major next-gen-only release the Switch 2 has seen since <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> in July. It’s currently sporting a not altogether impressive Metacritic score of 78, which is exactly in line with how the previous games in the subseries, <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> and <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, performed. Beneath some of the criticism of the repetitive combat and less-than-excellent mission design, however, early reviews are generally more positive than I was expecting.</p>

 <p>“I might hesitate to call<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment</em> an ‘essential’ Switch 2 game, but it’s a crucial piece of giving the system a strongly varied first-year lineup,” writes Hayes Madsen <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">for<em> Inverse</em></a>, who praised some of its<em> Star Fox</em>-like missions and said the story “genuinely enhances&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom.” </em>Chris Scullion, reviewing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">for <em>VGC</em>,</a> was even more upbeat, writing, <em>“Age of Imprisonment</em> may be the most serious of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games to date, but it’s also the one with the most engaging and rewarding combat.”</p>

 <p>Not everyone was equally impressed. “Repetition is baked into the genre, but its zen-like nature is stripped away in the latter parts of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s campaign as you’re forced to replay the same sorts of missions over and over again,” wrote Richard Wakeling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">for <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “Many missions only take place in small slithers of battlefields, and even the ones in bigger areas shuffle you quite cleanly from point to point,” wrote Oscar Taylor-Kent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">for<em> Gamesradar</em></a>. “There’s very little sense of scope to any of the environments, instead feeling just like corridors and rooms.”</p> <p>One thing to note: some big sites haven’t even published their <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> reviews yet because Nintendo’s embargo restrictions were too onerous. “Restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>non-public story details whatsoever,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">reported<em> IGN</em></a>. <em>The Verge </em>also opted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/813136/review-imprisoned-for-now">to wait until launch</a> to share its review. <em>Polygon</em> isn’t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3m4spqbnwwk2o">publishing its take yet either</a>. In the meantime, here’s what everyone else is saying.</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“Without any technical hiccups getting in the way, combat is still the star of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>. Unique Skills and Sync Strikes bring increased depth to its hack-and-slash histrionics, while elements of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are smartly adapted to fit the musou genre. The story doesn’t feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor’s performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far.” — Richard Wakeling</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-review-1235458481/">Rolling Stone</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“As a <em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;title, it effectively continues the worldbuilding from the&nbsp;<em>Beath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;duology; it also provides a sense of real agency for the princess herself, who somehow hadn’t even starred in her own game until last year’s disappointing&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. As a musou, it also manages to elevate the well-worn trappings of the subgenre by incorporating a shocking amount of actual&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> mechanics.” — Christopher Cruz</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“The core structure of<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>is entirely focused on taking over bases and fighting bosses. You don’t need to control the battlefield like in the <em>Fire Emblem</em> games, and allies largely can’t do damage to enemies — they’re only there to help support you. A good way to think of it is that this is a character action game (like <em>Devil May Cry</em>) grafted onto the bones of the <em>Warriors</em> structure — but it works.” — Hayes Madsen</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Gamesradar</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Age of Calamity</em> had a range of diverse and interestingly shaped maps, but<em> Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s feel bland in comparison – even when some maps are essentially the same as in the other game, the undemanding structure makes them worse in this outing. One specific wooded area is still a banger, though. Revisiting <em>Age of Calamity</em> alongside this new one, I had way more fun fighting back through even early encounters there, with sprawling battlefields and pockets of fighting.” — Oscar Taylor-Kent</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">RPG Site</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>For a certain type of player, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> will be the single game you’ll end up sinking the most time into on your Switch 2. If it wasn’t for every other RPG I’ve yet to play this year, I might have ended up in those shoes. <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> isn’t just a great <em>Zelda</em> spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire <em>Zelda</em> series. I simply can’t recommend it enough for anyone who is a fan of the <em>Warriors</em>‘ genre. — James Galizio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Oh, and here’s a bonus: this is one of these games that&nbsp;<em>runs well</em>. I don’t associate <em>Warriors</em> with that, even on higher-end consoles. But this is great. I don’t know if it began life as a Switch 1 game and was then shifted to the successor machine or what, but whatever the reasoning I’m thrilled to note that this looks nice enough but also maintains a solid and high frame rate, even when hundreds of troops are bouncing around on screen. — Alex Donaldson</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>In terms of the actual gameplay itself, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is undoubtedly still a<em> Warriors</em> game – for the uninitiated, Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series has had numerous licensed spin-offs for the likes of <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>,<em> Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Persona</em> and these <em>Zelda</em>-themed <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> titles – but it also feels a bit like a game trying even more than its predecessors to appeal to those not interested in its hack-and-slash principles. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>I went into <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> thinking I knew what to expect, but I was surprised by what I found. The improved performance—especially in local multiplayer—as well as the tweaks to combat really made the game stand out among the many <em>Warriors</em> titles. <em>Zelda</em> fans looking for a traditional adventure should look elsewhere. But if you’re down for an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pc-action-games" target="_self" rel="noopener">action game</a> that’ll easily steal dozens of hours of your life, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> is a terrific time. — Zackery Cuevas</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all looked up at the night sky and wondered what those lights really look like up close. Stars, planets, the craters on the moon – they’re all up there, waiting to be explored but telescopes have always seemed either too expensive or too complicated to bother with.</p>
<p>The <em>Hexeum</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/">beginner telescope just dropped to $85 from $149 on Amazon</a>, and brings real astronomy within reach of anyone curious enough to point it at the sky. This isn’t a toy telescope that shows you blurry dots, it’s an<strong> 80mm aperture refractor with actual quality optics, two real eyepieces and a Barlow lens that magnifies the moon up to 180 times</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Optics That Show You Something Worth Seeing</h2>
<p>With an aperture of 80mm, it captures much more light compared to smaller and entry-level scopes which will directly translate into a view that is brighter and clearer of the night’s starry objects. The focal length of 600mm at f/6.7 gives a balance between the wide-field views for star clusters and closer views of planets and the moon. Fully multi-coated lenses mean reduced light loss and increased brightness and clarity in the image so instead of a washed-out blob, you’re actually seeing sharp detail.</p>
<p>Right out of the box, the two eyepieces give you flexibility: The <strong>25mm eyepiece gives 24x magnification,</strong> perfect for scanning the sky to find objects or viewing larger targets like the Andromeda Galaxy or the Pleiades star cluster. The <strong>10mm eyepiece bumps you up to 60x magnification</strong> for detailed views of the moon’s craters, Jupiter’s bands or Saturn’s rings. The 3<strong>x Barlow lens triples the magnifying power of each eyepiece</strong> and pushes you to 72x and 180x when you want to zoom in even closer.</p>



<p>The adjustable aluminum tripod holds the telescope steady during viewing which is more important than one might think. Any shimmy or wobble gets magnified along with the image and turns the planets into jittery blurs. Sturdy construction means you don’t have to fight vibrations every time you touch the scope, so smooth focusing isn’t a problem. <strong>A phone adapter lets you snap photos of what you see</strong> by mounting your smartphone onto the eyepiece and turns casual star-gazing into shareable moments.</p>
<p>For $85, you’re paying what some people spend on a nice dinner for a tool that opens up an entirely new hobby. The lifetime maintenance support means you’re covered if anything goes wrong, and the responsive customer service handles questions within 24 hours. This telescope gives you real views of real astronomical objects-the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter orbiting in real-time, the rings of Saturn and countless star clusters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhammer Survivors is the new game from Auroch Digital, which has previously developed Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun and is working on Boltgun 2. Warhammer Survivors is less Boltgun and more Vampire Survivors in style, and that isn’t a surprise since Auroch Digital has partnered up with poncle and is using their game engine. Warhammer Survivors is an official Survivors game, but standalone and dripping in Warhammer action and lore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer Survivors Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You can really see the common ground between Vampire Survivors and this game, from the style of the pixel art to the pace of movement and the way that upgrades are dropped in boxes.</p>
<p>Players will be able to upgrade weapons and abilities so each run can last longer. Some of those weapons are the Boltgun, the Astartes Chainsword, and the Whirlwind Axes. Auroch Digital has also announced some of the playable characters for Warhammer Survivors including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Malum Caedo<wbr></li>
<li>Kozlowski&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Brother Luca&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<wbr><b>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Neave Blacktalon,</li>
<li>Sharynn Azurwath<wbr></li>
<li>Gotrek Gurnisson<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>These characters and others will be tasked with fighting Skaven and Tyranid swarms.&nbsp; Warhammer Survivors is due to be released in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p>

The release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/awesome-roguelike-astral-ascent-doubles-in-size-with-ver-2-0-launch-and-new-dlc">ver. 2.0 update and 'Outer Reaches' DLC</a> mean the game is almost twice as big as it was to begin with, and it will soon be getting even bigger... and cuter.</p>
<p>That's because the dev has revealed a new DLC, 'Celestial Haven', which will be coming to Steam later this month, with a Switch release following "shortly after", and it is packed (we mean <em>packed</em>) with adorable little pets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wnuilh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Celestial Haven adds a brand-new 'Shelter' area to the game's hub world, where you can house a troop of cute little critters to assist you on your runs. There are cat-like Lupo, doggy Vulpo, chinchilla-esque Pantero, and mythical Grifo and Draketo, all of whom will dig up rewards as you play and cheer you on whenever you level up.</p>
<p>We know you're thinking it too, and yes, you can pet all of them in the Shelter. <em>Thank god</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC will be listed for a minimum price of <strong>$1.99</strong> on Steam, with all proceeds going to the French animal charity <a href="https://one-voice.fr/en/">One Voice</a>. Come on, there's something particularly sweet about protecting both virtual <em>and</em> real animals, right?</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots and the official DLC rundown from the Celestial Haven <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4116520/Astral_Ascent__Celestial_Haven/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Celestial Haven DLC</strong> creates a cozy new spot in main hub where your lovely companions will get together, play and rest.</p>
<p>But they're not just cute: they're valuable companions you can bring along on your explorations. They’ll assist you during the runs by using its instincts to sniff out and dig up special rewards across the rooms. As good pets, they’ll follow you everywhere and celebrate your victories — from defeating a tough Zodiac to perfecting a room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had a wonderful time with Astral Ascent when it launched on Switch a few years back, calling it "probably the best roguelike since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/astral-ascent">our review</a>. Throw in some pettable animals for good measure, and we'd say you're onto a winner.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g502-hero-gaming-mouse-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-last-units-at-47-off-2000641070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-g502-hero-gaming-mouse-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-last-units-at-47-off.1343251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You know it: your gaming mouse is what makes… or breaks your performance. That split-second delay, the cursor skipping across the screen during a flick shot, or buttons that don’t register fast enough-all deal breakers when you’re trying to rank up. The Logitech G502 Hero has been a favorite among serious gamers for years and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/">Amazon just dropped the price from $69 down to $37 as they clear out remaining stock</a>. This<strong> 46% discount</strong> brings one of the most respected gaming mice down to impulse-buy territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision That Matters in Games</h2>
<p>The Hero 25K sensor tracks with 1:1 accuracy over a range from 100 to 25,600 DPI, which means the cursor goes exactly where you want it without any smoothing, filtering, or acceleration messing with your muscle memory. High DPI settings let you make huge sweeping movements with tiny hand motions, perfect for fast-paced shooters where you need to whip around instantly. Lower DPI gives you pixel-perfect precision for sniping or editing work when you need that surgical control.</p>
<p>The adjustable weight system lets you change how the mouse feels in your hand by <strong>adding up to five 3.6-gram weights or taking them away</strong>. Some gamers like a light mouse to move quickly around, while some like it with more heft for stability and control. You’ll be able to try different weight configurations until you find what feels right for how you grip the mouse and what games you play.</p>



<p>The <strong>11 programmable buttons</strong> give you instant access to abilities, macros or commands without reaching for your keyboard. Map your most-used actions to thumb buttons, assign weapon switches to side clicks or set up complex macro sequences for MMOs and MOBAs. The <strong>onboard memory stores up to five profiles</strong> directly on the mouse so your settings follow you to LAN parties, friend’s houses, or tournament setups without needing to reinstall software.</p>
<p>The <strong>RGB lighting syncs with other Logitech G gear</strong> via Lightsync technology and lets you coordinate colors across your whole setup. You can match your team colors, set up reactive lighting that responds to in-game events or just pick colors that look good on your desk. The lighting isn’t just aesthetic either: you can set different colors for different DPI levels so you know at a glance which sensitivity you’re running.</p>
<p>The <strong>wired connection eliminates any sort of battery anxiety or input lag</strong> that a wireless mouse may introduce. You never have to stop mid-game to charge it, never have drops in connection during clutch moments, and never have to deal with added weight from batteries. The braided cable resists tangling and holds up better than its rubber-coated alternatives, which inevitably crack and fray.</p>
<p>For $37, this mouse is cheaper than going out to dinner but upgrades a piece of hardware you touch for hours every single day.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

                <p>Vampire Survivors has spawned a wave of games inspired by it in the years since it was first released, and Warhammer Survivors is the next game set in this genre of endless hordes and power-ups. Featuring characters and weapons from both Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Survivors is a co-production between Auroch Digital and Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, using the same engine that powers the roguelite survivors game it's inspired by.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/players-spent-more-on-remakes-than-remasters-in-last-two-years-ampere-analysis/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/players-spent-2x-more-on-remakes-than-remasters-in-the-last-two-years.1343209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>According to research from analytics firm Ampere Analysis (per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">VGC</a>), over the last two years, players spent twice as much on remakes of video games compared to remasters. It's no secret that players are, for the most part, fond of a good remake and remaster. In the last two years (2024-2025), according to Ampere, across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation, 72.4 million players spent approximately $1.4 billion on remakes and remasters and microtransactions related to them.</p>



<p>Between January 2024 and September 2025, a period during which 15 remakes were released and 27 remasters, on average, players spent 2.2x more on remakes. Of course, there are a lot of factors here, like how remakes cost more to make, and as a result, cost more for players to buy. Remasters can cost less to make, but, as Ampere puts it, they "<em>offer faster turnaround and lower cost, but generally deliver less engagement</em>."</p>



<p>That's not always the case; The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a huge exception in that period between January 2024 and September 2025, a game that continues to sell well and even as of last week is <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">one of the top-five best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far</a>. Over <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">9 million players</a> have stepped back into Oblivion, and according to Ampere, it reached $180 million in consumer spending and 7 million monthly active users on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam at its peak.</p>



<p>Senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, Katie Holt added, "<em>As games and IP development costs escalate, publishers are increasingly raiding their back catalogues for cost-effective remakes and remasters. Publishers deciding between a full remake versus a remaster have to balance franchise planning, investment risk, age of content, platform support, and more when choosing which route to take</em>."</p>



<p>Remakes and remasters have become a massive part of the industry over the last decade, and there's no sign of that changing anytime soon. But with this research in mind, it'll be interesting to see if/how the approach to remasters and remakes changes.</p>
