This Thursday, August 7, is the air date of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw?si=Go2B9DbjQ6TjkrJB">a new Indie World Showcase</a> showcasing games coming to Nintendo platforms from smaller developers.

While we don't know exactly which games will be revealed during the stream, the description on the video says it will include "announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." Notable games we hope to hear more about include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/hades2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b435a0ab-2d81-45ef-aec6-d16f9dedb4ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Hades 2</a>, which should be leaving early access soon, and Hollow Knight: Silksong, a game so highly anticipated it's become a meme. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/#:~:text=Play%20Hollow%20Knight%3A%20Silksong%20with%20a%20new%20demo%20%E2%80%93%20on%20PC%20or%20ROG%20Xbox%20Ally%20X.">It should be playable at Gamescom</a>, however, so it's a little less unreasonable than usual to expect an appearance.</p><p>For everything announced at last week's Partner Direct, including <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/octopath-traveler-0-is-coming-this-december">Octopath Traveler 0</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-coming-to-all-platforms-including-switch">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-partner-direct/2025/07/31/everything-announced-at-the-july-nintendo-partner-direct">check out our round-up</a>.

<p>Sign of the times</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has released a brand new overview trailer for the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, and it has given us our first look at a new batch of Mouthful Mode transformations.</p>
<p>We first locked eyes on Spring Mouth way back at the game's Switch 2 reveal, but Gear Mouth and Sign Mouth are completely new! Gear Mouth gives Kirb some sweet rolling abilities, granting him the power to stick to walls and roll across moving platforms with ease. Sign Mouth, meanwhile, turns the pink puffball into a makeshift sledge for top-speed downhill racing. Side note: we're a little bit in love with Sign Mouth.</p>
<p>Outside of these newbies, the trailer provides a bit of clarity on the game's Star-Crossed World expansion, making clear that you'll be able to dive right in after you've finished the first area. It also highlights the new Colosseum mode, Ultimate Cup Z - EX, which looks to provide a more challenging Boss Rush for those after an extra slice of difficulty.</p>
<p>We're also pleased to see the confirmation that the Switch 2's improved graphics and faster frame rates will be put to good use in the main game and not <em>just</em> the expansion — we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, this one arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>28th August</strong> as both a stand-alone purchase and an upgrade pack.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Quake III Arena Remaster May Be In The Works]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Quake III Arena remaster may be in the works by Nightdive Studios, judging from a not-so-subtle tease from the developer itself.</p>



<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quake/">Quake series subreddit</a>, the developer has pinned a comment on its livestream that reads: <em>"All eyes, I mean Orbbs, will be on that announcement."</em> For those not in the know, Orbbs is the name of one of the bots available in Quake III Arena for offline play, so the developer pinning this comment definitely sounds like a tease for one of their upcoming announcement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remaster-experts-nightdive-studios-stand-ready-to-take-on-remastering-ps3-and-xbox-360-games/">Nightdive Studios</a> working on a Quake III Arena remaster wouldn't be surprising at all, considering how the development studio has brought several classic first-person shooters like System Shock to modern platforms and has worked with other developers to modernize classics with new content, including the first entry in the Quake series. Unlike these other titles, however, Quake III Arena is a multiplayer-focused title, so it will be very interesting to see how the studio will go about remastering one of the most influential competitive first-person shooters ever made.</p>



<p>Quake III Arena was launched back in 1999 on PC, and, despite being very different from its predecessor, it's regarded as one of the finest FPS ever released. With its multiplayer-only formula that did away with a traditional single-player campaign, the third entry in the series by id Software has influenced countless competitive FPS games, including Unreal Tournament and even more modern games like Overwatch. Hopefully, soon enough, even those who never had the chance to try the game out will be able to see for themselves how the game changed first-person shooters as a whole back in the day.</p>

            <p>A stickfellow in a top hat's just burst through a twentieth story window, taking a fatal tumble down the corporate ladder, and all because I lobbed a parcel at him. This kind of thing happens all the time in Stick It to the Stickman, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">beat ’em up</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> devs Free Lives are set to release in early access form later this month.</p>
<p>It's glorious enough to forgive any frustration you might have been left with when publishers Devolver Digital <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">announced late last year</a> that the corporate slapfest had been delayed into 2025.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can probably make out from the trailer below, Stick It to the Stickman's premise is cathartically simple: "Stickmen need jobs, but more importantly, shareholders need growth. Climb to the top of the tower to crush your boss's nuts, and please note that 50% of office work is kicking stickmen out of windows." Once you brawl your way to the roof of the office in simply cathartic fashion, you fight the existing CEO for the honour of leading the corporate megastructure, and the power to choose between spitting in the face of or bowing before the cabalistic corpoverlords which rule all.</p>
<p>The game's finally set to come out in early access form on August 18, but you can get a taste of its floppy fisticuffs by giving a freshly-revamped Steam demo a go. I have, and as my first exposure to sticking a fleshy wrench in the gears of capitalism, it gets a big thumbs up.</p>

<p>You start off sitting on a park bench, then beat your way through a throng of job applicants gathered around the lobby of a skyscraper. Naturally, you're asked to provide a reference in the form of the name of a friend who already works at the firm. Once you're hired, your first task is to beat this old friend and Fortnite buddy senseless via slapstick scuffle. Then, it's off up the tower, climbing ladders and entering lifts that sound suspiciously like toilets flushing to reach ever new levels of suited sticks in need of dragon punching, spin kicking, or just having a coffee mug lobbed at their bonce.</p>
<p>Free Lives seem to have gotten the mix of hilarious body floatiness once a stickperson gets smacked and the weighty punch you want inflicting such a blow to have pretty close to the sweet spot. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>, the cartoony physicality's top notch. The jokes about capitalism are pretty damn funny to boot.</p>
<p>The devs are aiming to have Stick It to the Stickman's early access last for "approximately 12 months", with fresh additions being made each month. "We plan on expanding the corporation to include manufacturing, marketing, a science center and a doomsday bunker, as well as corporate lobbying," they write. "Each new job within the game will have unique gameplay. And each new job will take the player one step closer to the final chapter of the story."</p>
<p>I'm pretty hooked on booting execs out of windows thanks to the demo, so this is definitely on my radar going forward.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unleash-blunt-force-castration-on-execs-when-stick-it-to-the-stickman-finally-launches-in-early-access-this-month]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Today’s Morning Checkpoint–<em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about–is filled with some good news, like new awesome retro game music being added to the Nintendo Music app, and also some bad news, like <em>IGN</em> losing more staff members as parent company Ziff Davis continues to make cuts. We also have some new and intriguing data on how popular (or not popular) video game engine Unity is in 2025, and more.</p> <h2>Stop Killing Games Enters Its Next Stage: Waiting</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stop Killing Games: Wrap up" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNkwxlLdkSo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>For the past year, Ross Scott’s campaign against game publishers shutting down online games completely and making them unplayable has been quite active. But now, the Stop Killing Games campaign has entered a new phase which is mostly about waiting to see what happens. That’s because the campaign’s biggest focus, an EU petition asking for lawmakers to pressure publishers into keeping games playable, is no longer accepting signatures. Now, in a new “wrap-up” video for Stop Killing Games, Scott says he’s going to take a break while he waits to see what happens, but he has assured supporters that he’ll pop back up if and when he’s needed.</p> <h2>More layoffs at the biggest gaming site, <em>IGN</em></h2> <p>On August 4, <em>IGN</em> parent company Ziff Davis laid off eight more staff members, as confirmed by the IGN Creator’s Guild Union. This follows additional layoffs at Ziff Davis and comes months after the multibillion-dollar company pushed some employees out via buyouts. Last year, three <em>IGN</em> staffers were laid off.</p>

 <p>“The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis-mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">explained the IGN Union in a message posted to social media</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <h2>All the songs from <em>Pilotwings</em> games are available on Nintendo’s music app</h2> <p>Nintendo continues to update and expand its Nintendo Online subscriber-only music player app. On August 5, the company added the full soundtracks from the entire <em>Pilotwings</em> series, which includes<em> Pilotwings, Pilotwings 64, </em>and <em>Pilotwings Resort</em>, to the Nintendo Music app. As with most other songs in the app, these tracks can be extended and looped for up to an hour. Finally, you can listen to the excellent song “<a href="https://youtu.be/s1vfrMel8iI?t=15">Flight Club</a>” for as long as you desire while doing something else.</p> <h2>The Switch 2 might be getting smaller game cart sizes</h2> <p>Taiwanese tech company Marconix, which is the company responsible for creating the game carts used by Nintendo for the Switch 2, <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/taiwanese-manufacturers-fiscal-update-could-hint-at-more-storage-sizes-for-switch-2-game-cards/">revealed in its latest fiscal update</a> that it is planning to produce carts in more capacity sizes. Currently, there is only one large 64 GB option, which is handy for big games like<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, but is a very expensive option for smaller games that don’t need all that space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">This has likely contributed to the high number of third-party publishers opting for game key cards</a> on Switch 2. Hopefully, these new size options from Marconix will mean fewer publishers use the controversial game key card option in the future.</p>

 <h2>Unity is becoming a less popular engine for game devs</h2> <p>In 2021, around 60 percent of game devs who participated in the Game Maker’s Toolkit Game Jam were using Unity. Now, new data from the popular YouTube channel reveals that in 2025, only 41 percent of the submitted games are using Unity. Many devs seem to be moving to Godot, a free and open-source game engine that has become more and more popular following some really dumb moves by Unity.</p>   <p>Back in 2023, Unity announced a series of controversial runtime fees that would cost devs a lot of money if their games became popular and were installed by many users. The company eventually walked back some and <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405">then eventually all of these plans</a>, but the whole ordeal left a sour taste in the mouths of many developers. And while this is just data from one game jam, it still seems to show that Unity might have to do a lot to win back smaller devs who don’t trust the company anymore.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-elder-scrolls-mod-remake-remaster-2000614628">The Other, Fan-Made <em>Oblivion</em> Remake Just Got An Awesome New Trailer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/and-roger-review-tearyhand-studio-pc-steam-switch-2000614568">One Of 2025’s Most Special, Emotional Games Is $5 And Will Take You An Hour To Finish</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-director-teases-next-crazy-thing-sequel-2000614546"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Director Teases Studio’s ‘Next Crazy Thing’</a></li> </ul>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tmnt-goes-turn-based-in-tactical-takedown-skating-onto-switch-next-week</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Well, here's an unexpected bit of news! After launching on PC earlier this year, Strange Scaffold has announced that its turn-based take on TMNT will be flipping onto Switch on <strong>14th August</strong> — wait, that's next week!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a> is all about turn-based action. You'll play as Leo, Raph, Donnie, or Mikey, as you flip, punch, and dash your way through a campaign that sees both Shredder and Master Splinter dead and gone, leaving the heroes in a half-shell to find their own way in the world.</p>
<p>It's a different, more strategic approach to the Turtles than we've seen from the IP before, but the developer promises an "innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat", so there should be just enough combo-focused Cowabunga-ing to keep the old and new Shell Heads happy.</p>
<p>All of this is presented in an almost tabletop visual style, which sees the Turtles moving across the grid on stands as if they are cardboard cutouts. In short, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the Switch version will launch with the all-new Remix Mode, which throws in more enemy variety, higher difficulty, and an increased importance on your Turtle's loadout. This mode will unlock for each level once you complete it, so you don't even need to wait until the end of the game to get involved.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a couple of screenshots from the Tactical Takedown Steam Page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 20 action-packed levels, divided into campaigns focusing on individual characters.<br>
- A unique take on the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the minds at Strange Scaffold (Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, I Am Your Beast).<br>
- Innovative turn-based beat-em-up combat, complete with mutating arenas.<br>
- Gorgeous graphic novel-inspired art style, with paint splatter, figurines, and diorama setpieces.<br>
- Customizable movesets to shape each Turtles' playstyle.<br>
- Thumping multi-genre soundtrack from award-winning composer RJ Lake (Unbeatable, I Am Your Beast).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been keeping our fingers crossed to see this one on Switch for a good few months now (heck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/we-really-want-to-see-this-turn-based-tmnt-game-come-to-switch">did we manifest it</a>?), so let's hope it's every bit as <em>totally tubular</em> as it seems.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:136168 @ 1754408127 -->
<p><em>Will you be picking this one up on Switch next week? Skate down to the comments and let us know.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tmnt-goes-turn-based-in-tactical-takedown-skating-onto-switch-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I'd love to say that Bloodgrounds plunged me into a crimson mist, but in practice, this arena tactics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with town-building feels as cosy as a pair of soft leather socci on a frosty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a>. The setup: you are a gladiator from a Roman-themed fantasy world, who has recently won his freedom in the arena. How is he celebrating his freedom? By becoming a gladiator manager himself, as he continues his quest for vengeance upon the Emperor who slaughtered his father.</p>
<p>I guess this is the optimal Russell Crowe career path, but still, imagine if he'd hung up his sword and reinvented himself as a carpet salesman. Instead of continuing the cycle of violence that was so cruelly forced upon you, you'd have to educate clients on pile density and antistatics while politely parrying their requests to hear about the time you ripped that Scandinavian's ears off with your toes.</p>

<p>People would point out that you sure have a lot of <em>blood-red</em> carpets in your carpet shop, har har, and you would smile delicately and consider your wine goblet and say "maroon and rose, actually". For every query like this, another maroon or rose carpet would appear in your shop and another townsperson would mysteriously go on holiday for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I forget why I'm talking about carpets. Oh yeah, that gladiator game.</p>
<p>Gladiators need to win the crowd, and Bloodgrounds is very much playing the hits (5% critical chance). Its tussles take place in handsomely decked pixelart stadiums boasting such ornamental fixtures as flaming torches and crucified bodies. Your characters and enemies move around according to an initiative bar along the top. There's a no-nonsense distinction between movement points and action points, which are used to perform regular attacks and special abilities, while consumables can be played for free.</p>
<p>The character classes seem both familiar and busily outfitted. There are helmeted thuggoes who can rope-dart people and stun them with a pommel; strutting retiarii equipped with throw-net and trident; archers who can set exploding traps from afar. Leering, scarred and eye-patched humans aside, you'll dally with mythical beasties such as spectral reapers and brazen quadrotor automatons. The arenas themselves have terrain fixtures such as mounted crossbows, and yes, the audience may lob in a power-up or two if they like the cut of your gibs. Preferably, your enemy's gibs.</p>
<p>Between clashes, you retire to your landscape-view villa where you can hire fresh meat and send any less than fresh meat to the infirmary. Much as in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Dankest Sturgeon</a>, you'll add and upgrade buildings with your winnings at other arenas, scattered across a world map of escalating difficulty. Each town facility has its talking head, and I find the writing and characters quite charming so far. Your architect, for example, is a sarcastic ghost sheep who probably began life in an Ovid story somewhere. Good for him.</p>
<p>Bloodgrounds launches this year. Developers Exordium Games are them wot did spacey shmup Last Encounter and horror comedy mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bear-with-me">Bear With Me</a>. It's published by Daedalic, who seem to have a thing for Romans lately - this January, they launched 4X strategy game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield_Fall_of_Rome/">Yield! Fall of Rome</a> from Billionworlds into early access.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-win-the-crowd-in-bloodgrounds-a-gladiator-tactics-rpg-with-darkest-dungeon-style-town-management]]></content:encoded>

If you’ve only been subscribed to Game Pass Standard, some of the year’s best games are about to fall into your lap.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/05/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-1/">full schedule</a> for Game Pass games arriving in the first half of August 2025:</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Rain World</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – August 5<br> <em><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>MechWarrior 5: Clans</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 7<br> <em><strong>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 12<br> <em><strong>9 Kings</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Preview, PC-only) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 14</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is a decent return to more old-school stealthing with a bit less of the modern-day RPG bloat that’s come to define the recent open-world entries in the series like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Meanwhile, <em>9 Kings</em> is a neat, top-down strategy roguelike that came to Steam Early Access back in May. Then there’s <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, a good-enough co-op shooter that arrives back on Game Pass after leaving the service years ago.</p>

 <p>The real winners this month, however, are Game Pass Standard subscribers. <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em> is one of 2024’s more overlooked gems, nailing the in-universe mood and storytelling and backing it up with solid action and mech customization. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> and <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em>, both out earlier this year, are strong GOTY runnerups. Folks on the cheaper Game Pass tier should be eating well for a bit, even as August is a quieter month overall for paying Ultimate customers on console. The arrival of <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> later in the month should offset the current doldrums for them, though.</p> <p>Sadly, August 15 is also when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> finally leaves Game Pass. Good luck finishing it by then if you haven’t already!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-phasmophobia-map-nells-diner-revealed-grafton-farmhouse-rework-coming-next-week.1262409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>map in the form of Nell's Diner, and the long-awaited Grafton Farmhouse rework now has a release date too.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Nell's Diner will be arriving later this year. Described by the developer as a "run-down, retro restaurant", the new map will be roughly equivalent in size to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s houses. You'll be able to explore "a classic diner counter, comfy booths, and a kitchen" as you hunt whatever specter happens to be haunting the place.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Nell's Diner yet, but when it arrives, creative director Daniel Knight says the new map will be "one of the most unique" he and his team have created for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=L8E5ahb2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=NBGJJxB8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nell's Diner may be small, but there's plenty of opportunity to get spooked here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing Nell's Diner, Kinetic Games has also announced when you can expect to play&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s reworked Grafton Farmhouse map, and it won't be too long before you can get your hands on the revamped stage.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 12th, the rework will apparently bring a "totally overhauled" Grafton Farmhouse in which you can expect to find "faulty electrics, caved-in ceilings and layers of dust" as well as an "eerie attic" and a "harrowing seamstress room". Sounds about right for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>

<p>Along with Nell's Diner, Knight says the new version of Grafton Farmhouse is "central to [the studio's] efforts in amplifying the horror in <em>Phasmophobia</em>", so if you're looking to experience the best the ghost-hunting horror game has to offer, it sounds like these new maps will be right up your street.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-grafton-farmhouse-rework-outdoor.jpg?itok=2S7cJGGh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-grafton-farmhouse-rework-outdoor.jpg?itok=yZuXJ8dh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Grafton Farmhouse rework arrives on August 12th.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a busy year for <i>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</i>so far. Back in April, Kinetic announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies on consoles alone</a>&nbsp;after launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S last October.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the game</a> in the works at horror production studio Blumhouse, although details on that project are somewhat scarce at the moment.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more in the coming months, but until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Grafton Farmhouse rework launches on August 12th, and Nell's Diner arrives later this year.</p>

                <p>Following hot off the heels of last week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, the gaming giant has announced an Indie World Showcase that's set to take place on August 7, later this week. According to the <a href="https://x.com/IndieWorldNA/status/1952716474440724634" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement post</a>, there'll be "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." The showcase is set to premiere at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and you'll be able to check it out on any of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Nintendo YouTube channels</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This marks the first Indie World Showcase following the launch of the Switch 2 in June, but it's not exactly clear what might show up. Just don't go expecting Hollow Knight: Silksong--that game, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-again-missing-from-nintendo-direct/1100-6533604/">absent from last week's Partner Showcase</a>, could appear in a traditional Nintendo Direct rather than the more low-key Indie events, as it's widely anticipated. The first Switch 2 Direct even featured it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-releasing-this-year-according-to-nintendo-switch-2-direct/1100-6530562/">as part of a sizzle reel back in April</a>.</p>

            <p>
Silksong fans, prepare to ride the rollercoaster of delirious anticipation and potential crushing disappointment once more: Nintendo has announced another indie-focused showcase is happening this week, so could this finally be the day for that release date news?
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo's Indie World showcase - as these things are officially known - airs this Thursday, 7th August, at 2pm in the UK. If you're over in yonder US, it's a considerably earlier start, with things kicking off at 6am PT or 9am ET.
</p>
<p>
As to what we can expect this time around, Nintendo's being as coy as always. However, it <em>is</em> promising "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie titles for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. And if that appeals, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>
A release date for Silksong - developer Team Cherry's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel - is, of course, the great hope this time around, especially given the excitement generated by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">reappearance in Nintendo's Switch 2 showcase back in April</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anticipation for the title - and frustration over the continuing lack of a release date - has now reached such a fever pitch other developers are savvily starting to get in on the action. Earlier this month, indie developer Pere Albacar promised social media followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope if Silksong made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">last week's third-party focused Nintendo showcase</a>. In the end it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show">didn't show up</a>, but there's always next time - which just happens to be this Thursday.
</p>
<p>If you're curious about what else is coming to Nintendo Switch consoles, you may also like to know that there'll be a separate Showcase in Japan, where the Indie presentation will be an extra five minutes long - these bonus minutes are usually home to some pretty cool stuff, so we will make sure to watch this, too, and bring you any extra information you need. </p><figure>
