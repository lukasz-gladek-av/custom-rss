<p data-characters="260" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Quite frankly, there are too many fantastic tracks for me to put on this list to elevate your reading experience. However, the following recommendations will likely become your go-to tracks for quite a while to come. So sit back, get comfy, and get swept away.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">I have gathered these tracks from my own extensive personal research, and from very popular recommendations from fellow fantasy readers, making this list rather comprehensive. Certain readers will want specific tracks to compliment the genre of fantasy they’re reading, so thankfully the following composers and OSTs will have something for everyone.</p> <div data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-best-composers-and-bands-for-fantasy-reading" data-level="2">Best composers and bands for fantasy reading</a><ul><li><a href="#h-faun" data-level="3">Faun</a></li><li><a href="#h-adrian-von-ziegler" data-level="3">Adrian von Ziegler</a></li><li><a href="#h-thomas-bergersen" data-level="3">Thomas Bergersen</a></li><li><a href="#h-peter-gundry" data-level="3">Peter Gundry</a></li><li><a href="#h-nest" data-level="3">Nest</a></li><li><a href="#h-rest-here-traveler-ambient-music" data-level="3">Rest Here Traveler ambient music</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#h-best-osts-to-listen-to-for-fantasy-reading" data-level="2">Best OSTs to listen to for fantasy reading</a><ul><li><a href="#h-dwarf-fortress-ost" data-level="3">Dwarf Fortress OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-witcher-3-ost" data-level="3">The Witcher 3 OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ost" data-level="3">Pirates of the Caribbean OST</a></li><li><a href="#h-elder-scrolls-osts" data-level="3">Elder Scrolls OSTs</a></li><li><a href="#h-the-lord-of-the-rings-ost" data-level="3">The Lord of the Rings OST</a></li></ul></li></ul></div> <h2 id="h-best-composers-and-bands-for-fantasy-reading" data-injectable="false">Best composers and bands for fantasy reading</h2> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">OSTs get a lot of love when it comes to fantasy music, so I’ll be starting with some lesser-known – yet excellent – composers. I either listen to these composers myself or keep seeing their names pop up around this discourse. Although there’s an unimaginable wealth of fantasy music out there, the following composers are some of the best.</p>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">There are some names you may expect to see here that I’ve omitted, as their works will be included in the OST section, so don’t worry.</p> <figure data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Lupercalia" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKXLg40eb4s?list=OLAK5uy_mrSm_kvalrLs26oeVblzNN9fMaEiGkpZU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-faun" data-injectable="false">Faun</h3> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">Faun is a band I’ve only just come across. Their music ranges from sweet and light fantastical pieces to more somber numbers with lyrics. It sounds not inspired by fantasy worlds but as though it were ripped right out of one. Heavier, darker pieces and more upbeat jigs also populate their works.</p> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">This is a band I’m going to be listening to more of immediately, as their music seems to fit effortlessly into almost any fantasy setting. </p>
 <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="81" data-injectable="false">I’d personally <a href="https://geni.us/AM5r9K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">recommend their Eden album</a>, although honestly, any will do. </p> <figure data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Celtic Music - Tale of the Gaels" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-YxthsXo2Q?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h3 id="h-adrian-von-ziegler" data-injectable="false">Adrian von Ziegler</h3> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Adrian von Ziegler is a composer I had the privilege of stumbling across many years ago. He composes mostly Celtic pieces, although he does dabble in a variety of other genres. He has years of musical content to listen to, including collections of his compositions for an uninterrupted and flowing listening experience.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">I would strongly suggest the celtic music, not only as there’s so much of it, but because it’s some of the best upbeat and lively fantasy music out there. As there are no lyrics, I can properly be immersed in the ebbs and flows of the music. His pieces immerse themselves into your reading experience fluidly.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/the-celtic-collection-adrian-von-ziegler/v6o36ogt0dwkc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celtic Collection</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Thomas Bergersen - Age of Gods (High Quality Audio)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fU3pHi6TCQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-thomas-bergersen" data-injectable="false">Thomas Bergersen</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">You’ve likely already heard lots of Thomas Bergersen’s music, or at least music from his production music company Two Steps From Hell. Seriously, open up Spotify or YouTube and search his name. The Invincible album is full of classic pieces that are instantly recognizable.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">For more exciting and action-packed fantasy stories, you can’t really go wrong with putting any of Thomas Bergersen’s tracks on. They have the power to turn any scene you’re reading into something ten times as epic.</p>
 <p data-characters="86" data-current-count="86" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/invincible/372716645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invincible album</a> for dramatic moments and chapters.</p> <figure data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Last of the Sky Guardians | Symphonic Destruction" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VUzg9K1DO4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h3 id="h-peter-gundry" data-injectable="false">Peter Gundry</h3> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">You have likely heard of Peter Gundry, for he is a rather popular composer. His music is typically slower, with more sinister or somber undertones for the most part. Each track makes the perfect background noise for darker or tragic fantasy stories.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">They will blend in with the words, slowly protruding into your mind until they become the backing track of the film playing in your mind. He is truly an excellent composer that I’ll certainly be listening to more of.</p> <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-edge-of-darkness/1023540312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Edge of Darkness album</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Moonbow" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZwCG2XWBoTM?list=OLAK5uy_lvBq9fbwjN5AxalbCJkoB6E3kQ_bENhpQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-nest" data-injectable="false">Nest</h3> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">I kept seeing Nest pop up – and I couldn’t resist but to give them a listen. The tracks that Nest produces are more mystical and slower pieces, to allow for the story to take center stage in your mind. </p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">The tracks are very lyric-light and tend to meander and weave around your mind. They’re not particularly exciting, although they’re not boring either. Such tracks could prove perfect for those who do not want anything too obnoxious to distract them from their reading.</p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend the <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/trail-of-the-unwary/1595733078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail of the Unwary album</a> for moody and more somber fantasy reading.</p> <figure data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="6 Hour Rest Here Traveler ambient music with fire burning" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2VzuA6UZ7A?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h3 id="h-rest-here-traveler-ambient-music" data-injectable="false">Rest Here Traveler ambient music</h3> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">This isn’t a composer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2VzuA6UZ7A&amp;list=PLdMVpI56As754ealpF1zFGYGfNDh0Qa4p&amp;index=16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but is one track</a> I thought I’d add as a little bonus. I am unsure why, but I <em>adore</em> this track, and it is my go-to for lots more than just reading. Although it’s essentially the same melody repeating with the sound of a bonfire, I have yet to get bored of it.</p> <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">This track is a personal recommendation, sure, but I feel so strongly about it that I can’t not include it.</p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this track for more relaxing reads or to block out background noise.</p> <h2 id="h-best-osts-to-listen-to-for-fantasy-reading" data-injectable="false">Best OSTs to listen to for fantasy reading</h2> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Most readers who listen to music, myself included, love to listen to OSTs. So popular are these OSTs that you’ve likely already used them for your fantasy listening pleasure. If you find one or two that you haven’t yet listened to – then save it for later.</p> <h3 id="h-dwarf-fortress-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dwarf-fortress-original-game-soundtrack/1656317303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dwarf Fortress OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Starting off with an OST I simply keep coming back to that’s also criminally underrated, I’d love to introduce you to the Dwarf Fortress OST by Dabu and Simon Swerwer. There is something too rich about this OST that is a struggle to put into words, but I’ll try my best.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">These tracks, especially the main theme, are brimming with their own stories woven into the mystical notes and melodies. This OST provides you with ominous ambiguity, action, melancholy, and, strangely, hope. I am literally listening to this OST as I write.</p> <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for melancholic, casual, and deeper fantasy stories (and for life in general).</p> <h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-original-game-soundtrack/1333501415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3 OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">The Witcher 3 is very renowned for its OST by Marcin Przybyłowicz. <em>Many</em> readers recommend the tracks in this OST that resemble the White Wolf himself: dark and hopeful, quick and calm, powerful and gentle. </p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">The world of The Witcher is a very detailed and rich fantasy world, and this OST pays it a huge compliment. These tracks feel native to the continent, and they’ll seep into your fantasy worlds effortlessly.</p> <p data-characters="72" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for casual high-fantasy reading.</p> <h3 id="h-pirates-of-the-caribbean-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of/1440649561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Caribbean OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">The Pirates of the Caribbean has a vast OST if you include all five films, which I highly recommend you do. Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, and Geoff Zanelli all contributed to the exciting and incredible scores that make whatever you’re doing so much cooler than it already is.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">These OSTs hit many different themes expertly. You’ll find gloomy and sad pieces, romantic and tragic pieces, and, most importantly, epic action scores. The films are known for their excellent fantastical elements and action sequences, and none of them would be as good as it is without the music.</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">I’d personally recommend this OST for grand adventures or action sequences.</p> <h3 id="h-elder-scrolls-osts" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-original-game-soundtrack/596951310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elder Scrolls OSTs</a></h3> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">The Elder Scrolls series is a franchise rich with entries – and with music. The past three installments of the main Elder Scrolls franchise, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, have incredible and renowned fantasy tracks that inspire all sorts of emotions. Jeremy Soule is the music composer for all three titles.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Considering how vast each of these three games is – in theme, locations, story, and setting – the soundtracks from these OSTs are ripe for any fantasy scenario. With such a grand catalog of premium fantasy music, you won’t be running out of music to listen to any time soon.</p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Out of all the games, I’d personally recommend the Skyrim soundtrack for all sorts of fantasy reading. </p>
 <h3 id="h-the-lord-of-the-rings-ost" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship/323714092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings OST</a></h3> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Ending this list with an absolute classic and staple of fantasy culture – The Lord of the Rings OST, by Howard Shore. This collection of tracks really doesn’t need an introduction and has become the official soundtrack of fantasy for many.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">The pinnacle of fantasy – the books and films – were complimented perfectly by these tracks, so I’m sure they’ll transpose your stories into something even more magical. Also, there are loads of remixes and covers out there. I personally enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVlN327sn0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lofi versions from Bits &amp; Hits</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">I’d recommend this OST for almost <em>any</em> fantasy reading, be it dramatic, tragic, adventurous, or romantic.</p> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">With these excellent music recommendations, your fantasy reading will be elevated to new heights.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After the release of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-skyline-valley-patch-notes-map-expansion-vault-63-secrets-and-new-public-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyline Valley update for <em>Fallout 76</em></a><em>, </em>players quickly noticed that scrapping Pickaxes resulted in Legendary modules. This obvious glitch has fans on the hunt for these previously mediocre but now extremely valuable weapons.</p> <h2 id="h-pickaxe-spawns-have-been-temporarily-disabled" data-injectable="false">Pickaxe spawns have been temporarily disabled</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fallout-76-scrap-pickaxe-legendary-module.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately for players hoping to get some easy Legendary modules, this exploit was busting the economy of <em>Fallout 76</em>. Bethesda released a hotfix to temporarily disable Pickaxes from spawning in the world. This also means that if you have the blueprint to craft a Pickaxe, you’ll get a “lack the requirements” message when you try to make one.</p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">However, even after the hotfix, Pickaxes still appear in some locations, and they occasionally drop from Scorched enemies as well. Here are the places you’ll want to check out to find a Pickaxe after the hotfix:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false"> <li>Foundation – Exterior</li> <li>Gauley Mine</li> <li>Glassed Cavern</li> <li>Nuka World On Tour – Tunnel of Love</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-pickaxes-in-fallout-76-normally" data-injectable="false">Where to find Pickaxes in Fallout 76 normally</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fallout-76-pickaxe-tunnel-of-love.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">If you want a Pickaxe because you’re a completionist and need to collect every weapon in the game, you might want to know all the places you can find them in normal circumstances. In addition to the above locations, Pickaxes usually spawn in the following areas:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true"> <li>Blackwater Mine</li> <li>Garrahan Mining Headquarters</li> <li>Greg’s Mine Supply</li> <li>Lucky Hole Mine</li> <li>Miners Monument</li> <li>Tygart Wastewater Treatment Plant </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Though Pickaxes can currently still be found in <em>Fallout 76 </em>even after the hotfix, it’s only a matter of time before Bethesda notices the oversight and also disables those spawn locations or patches the Legendary module glitch. So if you’re hoping for some easy looting, you might want to hurry.</p>

<p data-characters="62" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><strong><em>This article contains spoilers for Destiny 2: The Final Shape.</em></strong></p> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">If players have spent some time combing through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/"><em>Destiny</em>&nbsp;<em>2</em></a>‘s endgame content, there’s little doubt they’ve encountered one of the mysterious shrouded statues. These fixtures have been an enigma since their first appearance in-game, with little to no explanation about the origin or purpose of the identical structures.&nbsp;However, in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians finally get some answers about these creepy statues.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">The shrouded statues first appeared in the&nbsp;<em>Shadowkeep</em>&nbsp;expansion, found throughout the campaign and at the very end of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/">Garden of Salvation Raid</a>. Since then, they have sporadically popped up wherever Darkness gathers, like the Deep Stone Crypt Raid. While an apparent connection to the Darkness, as The Witness uses it to speak to players, the statues have literally remained shrouded in mystery until now.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-destiny-2-s-shrouded-statues" data-injectable="false">What are Destiny 2’s shrouded statues?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">During The Final Shape’s campaign, the shrouded statues take a bit of a spotlight. After Commander Zavala’s past is dredged up and his resolve tested, the character notices the statues trying to speak with him. The Commander believes they’re trying to help. While Zavala’s abrupt change in demeanor and the clear connection between the statues and The Witness cause alarm for Ikora Rey and our allies, he’s ultimately&nbsp;right.</p>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Investigating the statues deeper, players and Zavala discover that they are indeed trying to communicate with us&nbsp;—&nbsp;and&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;not overtly hostile.&nbsp;However, at first, the most Guardians can get out of the entities is their desire to see us give ourselves to Darkness. When Zavala briefly gives in to the influence of The Witness, the statues show him what they really are: dissenters.</p>
 <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">The Witness is an entity created from the mass sacrifice of an entire species.&nbsp;And we learn that not&nbsp;every one&nbsp;of those progenitor people&nbsp;shares&nbsp;the same vision as The Witness.&nbsp;The shrouded statues are still part of The Witness, but these individual conscious objectors have been suppressed and excised from the greater collective that’s unified in purpose.&nbsp;Some of the voices from these statues note that time has twisted the intent of The Witness, while others seem&nbsp;to&nbsp;never have&nbsp;been&nbsp;on board with the endeavor.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-do-the-shrouded-statues-want" data-injectable="false">What do the shrouded statues want?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">As dissenters, the individuals within the shrouded statues are&nbsp;aghast&nbsp;to see The Witness so close to enacting its Final Shape. Physically trapped and separated within statues, they’re almost powerless to stop The Witness. However, as they&nbsp;still are a&nbsp;part of The Witness, the shrouded statues are an unguarded weakpoint.</p>
 <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">When we finally discover the statue’s intent, Guardians realize they must embrace Darkness to sequester their help. This comes to pass in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-defeat-dolgith-blade-of-reasoning-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Iconoclasm </a>mission, where we’re gifted a sword forged of Light and embrace Darkness while engaging The Witness. From within the Darkness, Guardians find themselves surrounded by the shrouded statues, with many more dissenters than initially imagined.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have a simple ask: to die.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">The dissenters within the shrouded statues are in a perpetual state of undeath as they watch The Witness carry out its heinous acts. They beg for Guardians to use the Light sword to destroy them, severing their connection to The Witness and ending their existence. While individually helpless in undying life, their collective dissection and death make The Witness vulnerable.</p>

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Naoya Matsumoto’s <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>has been a smash hit for the past few years, and that trajectory got white hot when the anime adaptation premiered back in April. Now it’s getting a shot at video games with the <a href="https://x.com/kj8_thegame/status/1801984554858934272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly-announced</a> and tentatively-titled <em>Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Akatsuki Games is in charge of development and distribution for the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>game. The studio is also behind Extreme Baseball action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tribe Nine</em></a>, which was first announced in 2021 and finally has a closed beta test on the way this August. Neither that nor <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>have release dates in place yet.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="670" data-injectable="true">Joining Akatsuki Games are TOHO Games and anime studio Production I.G, which handles animation production for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-is-the-feel-good-monster-mash-we-need-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>anime</a>. Beyond that, all we know is that <em>Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME </em>is in the works for mobile devices and PC, and will be available via the App Store, Google Play, and Steam. You can see a quick cinematic tease in the debut trailer below.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="『怪獣８号 THE GAME』第１弾トレーラー／『Kaiju No. 8 THE GAME』OFFICIAL TRAILER 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kJ7mXzFbGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>manga has been running in the pages of <em>Weekly Shonen Jump </em>since July 2020. As of March 2023 it had 11 million copies in circulation around the world. Those numbers are sure to continue climbing following the anime, which is currently running with Shigeyuki Miya and Tomomi Kamiya directing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="600" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The story follows Kafka Hibino, who finds that his dreams of enlisting in the Defense Force have fallen to the wayside by the time he’s in his thirties. Instead, he spends his days handling stomach-turning cleanup duties after the dust has settled on the latest colossal Kaiju battle. After meeting Reno Ichikawa, however, that ambitious spark is reunited, and he vows to join his childhood friend Mina Ashiro in the Defense Force ranks and protect humanity from the encroaching Kaiju threat. Then, in an unexpected twist of fate, he ends up gaining the ability to turn into a Kaiju himself… </p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">Yep, this is the good stuff. Both the <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>manga and anime are worth your time if you haven’t checked them out already. Hopefully the game will be able to follow suit with confidence whenever it arrives.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has donated $4311 (£3397) to the Save the Children charity after Helldivers chose morality over manslaughter earlier this week.</p>
<p>Arrowhead CCO and Helldiver 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt confirmed the donation after <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1800533719985311947">Helldivers players chose</a> to save the trapped survivors – which turned out to be thousands of sick children – on Vernen Wells rather than hunt down the raw ingredients they could use to make MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines on Marfark.</p>

<p>Why $4311 exactly? Well, that's because Helldivers managed to save 4311 in-game children, which turned into a charity donation to save real-life children, too.</p>
<p>"Since the Helldivers 2 community chose to save the children, [Arrowhead Game Studios] does the same," Pilestedt wrote. "We have made a donation to, well, Save the Children. Great job Divers!"</p> <div>

<p>Players were also then treated to a follow-up message from The Very Sick Children of Super Citizen Anne's.</p>
<p>"Dear Helldivers: Thank you so much for saving us. They told us you made a lot of sacrifices (mines/lives) to help us. We'll always be grateful. Now, we can grow up to become Helldivers too."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We also have a special message to share with you:</p><p>"Dear Helldivers,</p><p>Thank you so much for saving us.

<p>Players were then <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1801625047418667450">encouraged</a> to go for the mines, too, even though the development team was certain "they never will" get it done in time…</p>
<p>Sorry, Helldivers, but no – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-helldivers-2-story-mode-is-not-happening">Arrowhead has no plans to introduce a story mode for Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Responding to a commenter on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, newly-appointed CEO Shams Jorjani confirmed a story mode was "not happening".</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 may be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers have declined</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 24 hours is 80,038, although that only accounts for Steam players, of course.</p>

		<p>Jason Schreier did as Jason Schreier does last week and published a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a big-name game, full of wild revelations from sources that did not want to be named in the article because these are the kinds of bombshell stories They don't want You to know.</p><p>The game in question was <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and the article told the shocking story of a celebrated development studio tried to branch out beyond its wheelhouse and realized that it wasn't as good at that new thing as the thing they've been doing to tremendous acclaim for the past decade or more.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Leadership didn't seem worried, they say, even as other traditionally single-player game studios that chased the live-service trend were delivering abysmal results with games such as Anthem (which earned a lowly score of 59 out of 100 on Metacritic), Marvel's Avengers (67 out of 100) and Redfall (56 out of 100)."</em> — Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?ref=remapradio.com">notes in his Suicide Squad feature</a> that BioWare, Crystal Dynamics, and Arkane likewise struggled to reproduce their single-player success in a live service world.

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p><em>Suicide Squad’s</em> problems with creative direction at the highest levels that were so bad, even the rank-and-file developers could clearly see the pitfalls they were headed straight for. There was some chasing of trends, some organizational mismanagement, key leaders who had a hand in everything but didn't seem to know what game they were making, resulting in frequent changes that wasted a bunch of work.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Levine would tell his staff to overhaul large chunks of levels or sections of the city, seemingly at a whim, based on what he thought would be best for the game. Every cut or change Levine made had trickle-down effects for the lower-level designers, artists, and programmers. It was demoralizing to put weeks of your life into something only to watch it get flushed down the drain."</em> – In his book <em>Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/5/10/22424321/a-look-inside-bioshock-infinites-troubled-development?ref=remapradio.com">excerpted by Polygon</a>, Schreier details a lot of the same complaints from developers who worked on BioShock Infinite at Irrational Games.
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>Schreier noted that <em>Suicide Squad</em> also suffered from "a culture of rigid perfectionism" at Rocksteady that aggravated the studio's other problems.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Shooting a sack of grain in Uncharted 4 would cause the sack to deflate as barley poured out of it. Shining a flashlight at Ellie's face in The Last of Us led her to blink and turn away. Those details exist because Naughty Dog has built a culture of perfectionism, where games have to be great, no matter the human cost."</em> – Schreier, in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962?ref=remapradio.com">2020 Kotaku feature</a> on the development of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>.
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>And even as the troubled project limped down the home stretch, studio leadership was confident it would all come together at the last minute.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>
<em>"Within the studio, there's a term called 'BioWare magic.' It's a belief that no matter how rough a game's production might be, things will always come together in the final months. The game will always coalesce. It happened on the Mass Effect trilogy, on Dragon Age: Origins, and on Inquisition... Even when a project feels like a complete disaster, there's a belief that with enough hard work—and enough difficult crunch—it'll all come together."</em> – <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964?ref=remapradio.com">Schreier's Kotaku feature on Anthem.</a>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>OK, so maybe the revelations in the <em>Suicide Squad</em> feature weren't quite as wild as the lead made it sound. If this feature feels a bit formulaic at this point, it's not because of the things Schreier had control over; the writing, the reporting, the facts included, and the context given. The problem was in the story itself, because it's a story we've seen time and time again in the AAA game space, and one Schreier has told himself more than a few times.</p><p>In fact, the behind-the-scenes game dev story is so formulaic at this point, I'm more interested in the parts of the formula that weren't included here, specifically the rampant crunch (of the kind detailed in Schreier's <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466?ref=remapradio.com"><u>2018<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> feature</u></a>) or sexism (as in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the feature he wrote about Ubisoft</u></a> in the wake of public allegations about the company culture).</p><p>The absence of such complaints doesn't necessarily mean these things weren't present, but given how these complaints have fit the formula we're talking about in the past, perhaps we can be cautiously optimistic about their omission here.</p><p>Those angles aside, the fact that these studio tell-all features have started to feel so same-y says less about the journalist reporting them and more about how mundane this kind of dysfunction is in AAA game development. That's why the stories behind flops like <em>Anthem</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em> can sound so similar to the stories behind hits like <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, <em>BioShock Infinite</em>, and <em>Mass Effect</em>, and it's why the people in charge of a team making the former can convince themselves they're actually making the latter until it's too late.</p><figure></figure><p>In a lot of ways this is simply how many AAA games are made, and this dysfunction no more guarantees a flop than a rational and efficient development process guarantees a hit.</p><p>Again, none of this is to take away from the work of Schreier, who has built his career on a valuable form of in-depth reporting that is not so regularly done in this field, and is vital given the industry's absolute disdain for any amount of transparency. His stories, however, are accounts of what happened behind the scenes, but they don’t explain why one game is good and successful and another is poor and a flop. Together they paint a picture of practices endemic to the industry.</p><p>Even if these stories don't stand out as singularly massive scandals or all start to blend into one another, I think there's still value in these kinds of stories. Because if the goal is to actually produce meaningful improvements in the way the industry makes games to reduce the amount of human collateral damage—and it really should be—blockbuster reporting on industry-shaking scandals doesn't really go as far as you might hope.</p><p>I'm thinking here of the sexism scandals we've seen around Riot Games, Ubisoft, and Activision Blizzard over the past six years or so, each of which was either sparked or furthered by investigative reporting. We've seen some accountability in the form of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/27/riot-discrimination-100-million-settlement/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>multimillion-dollar lawsuit settlements</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/blizzard-entertainment-activision.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>executive departures</u></a>, and even <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ubisoft-sexual-harassment-police-1850898896?ref=remapradio.com"><u>criminal investigations</u></a>, and that's not nothing. But in each case, the accountability has stopped short of the people most responsible for fostering corporate cultures where indefensible behavior was tolerated and even protected.</p><p>Riot co-founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill are still with the company in leadership roles. Yves Guillemot is still CEO at Ubisoft, if you can “<a href="https://x.com/UbisoftItalia/status/781531519198257152?ref=remapradio.com"><u>belYves</u></a>” it. And while Bobby Kotick is no longer running Activision Blizzard, it's hard to take a look at <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-ceo-stands-to-reap-nearly-400-million-in-microsoft-deal-and-that-may-be-just-the-start-11642540612?ref=remapradio.com"><u>how much he made</u></a> from the $70 billion sale to Microsoft and think this represents comeuppance of any sort.</p><p>As much as some people might have made a big show of how they would no longer support such companies (and let's go ahead and say every last one of them followed through for the sake of argument), it didn't really make a difference. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Ubisoft</u></a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/overwatch-2-helps-activision-blizzard-rake-in-record-bookings?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Activision Blizzard</u></a> both set new bookings records in the years since their scandals broke, so whatever negative impact the scandals may have had was more than offset by the masses of people who either never heard about them, or figured it wasn't a big enough deal to impact their purchasing decisions.</p><p>I'm convinced now that there is no story so earth-shattering, so horrifying, so diligently researched and expertly told that we could Upton Sinclair's<em> The Jungle</em> our way to a better games industry. Even Sinclair's landmark novel—informed in part by his first-hand experiences with the shockingly unsanitary and brutal working conditions in Chicago's meatpacking industry—didn't have the impact he wanted, despite it prompting popular outcry that ultimately <a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/changes-science-law-and-regulatory-authorities/part-i-1906-food-and-drugs-act-and-its-enforcement?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20nauseating%20condition%20of%20the%20meat%2Dpacking%20industry%20that%20Upton%20Sinclair%20captured%20in%20The%20Jungle%20was%20the%20final%20precipitating%20force%20behind%20both%20a%20meat%20inspection%20law%20and%20a%20comprehensive%20food%20and%20drug%20law"><u>led to the creation</u></a> of what is now called the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Sinclair understood it wasn't his heartbreaking depiction of how capitalist structures enforce and exploit hopeless poverty that moved people; they were just grossed out at the idea of workers falling into the meat grinders and winding up in their food.</p><blockquote>"I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach." – Sinclair, on the response to The Jungle.</blockquote><p>Much of <em>The Jungle</em> is about the exploitation of the poor more broadly, but it was the meatpacking bits that resonated most strongly because while people generally dislike systemic abuse of the poor, they find fingers in their hotdogs infinitely more distasteful.</p><p>So while public outcry and the "vote with your wallets" crowd might have moved the needle in early 20<sup>th</sup> century meatpacking, it's not going to be effective in the modern games industry because there's no equivalently distasteful byproduct of these scandals that impacts the end user. (And that's not for lack of trying, given the industry has already forced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-industrys-disingenuous-defense-of-loot-boxes-this-week-in-business?ref=remapradio.com"><u>gambling</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/always-online-simcity-burns-to-the-ground-10-years-ago-this-month?ref=remapradio.com"><u>DRM</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-gives-gran-turismo-sport-the-boot-this-week-in-business?ref=remapradio.com"><u>planned obsolescence</u></a> into games over the objections of players, who eventually grew to just accept it all.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>The scene of some deeply ironic moments in Bioshock Infinite.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The industry's ongoing switch to digital effectively makes a surprise worker's finger in the end product even more of an impossibility (except in cases of $300 collector's editions, where an honest-to-goodness developer body part might be seen as a feature rather than a bug).</p><p>All that is to say I've lost a bit of faith in the power of one sensational story to bring about meaningful change. After all, journalism can't fix problems directly; it can only bring them to light, at which point the people and institutions that actually do have the power to hold others to account are supposed to kick in and do their job. And as you may have noticed, many of those people and institutions seem to have taken the past decade off.</p><p>So what can bring about meaningful change? It's not particularly sexy, but I think a better understanding of the common causes of these problems absolutely helps, and like water wearing down stone, that understanding is more likely to be driven by a continuous drip of stories like the <em>Suicide Squad</em> feature than one big splashy piece about the Worst Studio Ever.</p><p>It's easy for an executive to look at stories like Activision Blizzard or Riot Games and learn absolutely nothing, or come away thinking they are doing a good job because they aren't actively <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-activision-blizzards-kotick-knew-about-sexual-misconduct-allegations-for-years?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20the,allegations%2C%20it%20said"><u>overruling HR</u></a> to protect a studio co-head accused of sexual harassment, or because they aren't <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483?ref=remapradio.com#:~:text=One%20former%20male%20employee%20said%20that%20Riot%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cbro%20culture%E2%80%9D%20is%20more%20pronounced%20behind%20closed%20doors%2C%20and%20hurts%20men%20too%3A%20One%20of%20Riot%E2%80%99s%20male%20senior%20leaders%20regularly%20grabbed%20his%20genitals%2C%20the%20source%20said%2C%20adding%2C%20%E2%80%9CIf%20he%20walked%20into%20a%20meeting%20with%20no%20women%20he%E2%80%99d%20just%20fart%20on%20someone%E2%80%99s%20face.%E2%80%9D"><u>farting in employees' faces</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine it's harder for them to brush aside the drumbeat of stories about the <em>Suicide Squads</em> and <em>Anthems</em> of the world because what went on in those studios is not particularly sensational. It's the same kind of people in the same kind of roles making the same kind of mistakes over and over.</p><p>So how do things get better? Well, here's the concluding paragraph of the initial draft of this article I submitted:</p><p>"Assuming the creative directors running these studios aren't completely obtuse (just go with me here), there's only so many times you can see so many different peers stepping on the same rakes for the same reasons before you start watching where you put your own feet."</p><p>Originally, that was the end of the article. To which my editor here Rob Zacny took a page from <em>Return of the King </em>and said, “That was great, but what if it had more endings?”</p>

This is one of so very many details I desperately wish I could fact check, but never will. Because in 2016, my dad—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-hugh-walker-1949-2016&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-hugh-walker-1949-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Walker</a></span>—unexpectedly dropped dead on the sidewalk at the age of 66. He was walking home from breakfast at a friend’s, and then he wasn’t any more. And with him went nearly seven decades of encyclopedic information on every detail of world history, and forensic knowledge of the UK game development scene of the 1980s.</p><p>My dad was like a cuddly toy in many respects, but one in particular was the metaphorical hoop on a length of string protruding from his back, that when pulled would unleash a breathless spiel of informed and entertaining knowledge. It was always a monologue, but it was generally worth listening to. It might be that you’d accidentally trigger something on the royal turbulence of the 1500s, but it could equally be the origins of film-license specialists Ocean Software, or personal anecdotes on how he became friends with the developers at Level 9, developers behind text adventures like <em>Jewels of Darkness</em> and <em>Ingrid Strikes Back</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-recommend-id="image://912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-format="jpg" data-width="988" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Level 9 / Mobygames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-recommend-id="image://912be8c7d4f82a1a97db45c9c6fd5725" data-format="jpg" data-width="988" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Level 9 text adventure Ingrid's Back, with drunk dwarfs in a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In 1981, Hugh Walker got the first ever affordable (although we could barely afford it) mass-produced home computer, the ZX-81. In 1982 he was sent a pre-release ZX Spectrum 48K to review for a magazine. In 1984 he had a game published, a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/zx-comp/zx_names.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/type-ins/zx-comp/zx_names.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">type-in</a></span>” for a magazine, called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0025997/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://worldofspectrum.net/item/0025997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warlock</em></a></span>. (I can make a strong argument for it being the first ever roguelite.) He regularly contributed to a popular UK fanzine called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/adventure-probe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://worldofspectrum.org/archive/magazines/adventure-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Adventure Probe</em></a></span> (in 1990 he wrote an against-the-grain lengthy feature arguing in favor of “character interaction” being included in games). I remember helping him playtest unreleased text adventures. And he’d come back from big gaming events like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Computer_Trade_Show&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Computer_Trade_Show" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECTS</a></span> with bags of swag—all of which is made much stranger when you learn that he didn’t work with computers, nor have anything to do with the gaming industry. He was an NHS dentist (as in, the badly paid kind)—computers and gaming were simply a hobby.<br></p><p>I was born in 1977, so I wasn’t even in school when computers first entered our house. Because of dad’s connections, I reviewed my first video game at the age of 11. It’s some messed up superhero origin story stuff, given my job now, minus the “super” and “hero” parts. And of course, growing up surrounded by gaming is the most normal thing imaginable now, but it was much more rare back then.</p><p>Games were a key part of my relationship with my dad. The first time I knew he was capable of being scared was watching his hand shake on the mouse as he battled the dragon on level 13 of FTL’s seminal 1987 RPG, <em>Dungeon Master</em>. He demonstrated his enormous tolerance of me as I begged him for a go in the middle of his game of <em>UFO: Enemy Unknown</em> and would get his entire squad killed because I wanted to play it like an arcade game. I learned of his enormous, inexplicable patience, as I would sit next to him, watching him play 1991’s original <em>Civilization</em>, pestering him to start a war rather than working out wheat prices or whatever the hell that boring-ass game had you do.</p><h2 id="h4861"><a id=""></a><strong>The great gaming schism</strong></h2><p>As I grew through childhood, so did games. From white text on a black screen, they gained crude images, then entire games were made from these moving sprites. And as I became a teenager, video games very appositely represented the ways in which I deviated from my father, as is tradition. Adventures had diverged, evolving into both graphic adventures and RPGs. I went left, he went right. I played every single Sierra and LucasArts game, plus all their knock-offs (as well as FPS games as well, of course), occupying his 486 PC until my bedtime mercifully returned his machine to him, when he would then be sat surrounded by hand-drawn maps on squared paper as he explored dungeon after dungeon. SSI’s <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> games occupied him far more than was reasonable, alongside stone-cold classics like <em>Betrayal At Krondor</em> and <em>Lands of Lore</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-recommend-id="image://86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I’d imagined.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mobygames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-recommend-id="image://86a679ed5880ce03a9fbf68c60749aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Betrayal At Krondor has not, um, held up as well as I'd imagined." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But we still intersected, like slot cars on a crossover track. The collisions were when we both wanted to play the same game at the same time, as was certainly the case for the all-time great Looking Glass title, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/four-of-the-best-pc-games-ever-are-free-right-now-1847448962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/four-of-the-best-pc-games-ever-are-free-right-now-1847448962"><em>Ultima Underworld II</em></a></span>, the first game we bought for dad’s shiny new PC. (It pushed all 2 MB of RAM to the limits.) But primarily, dad lost his patience for obscure puzzles, and I lost my patience for mixing potions. It wouldn’t be until BioWare started flexing (with <em>Baldur’s Gate</em>) that I’d rediscover the RPG, but that would be the same time the genre lost dad’s interest.<br></p><p>Thankfully for him, <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>never went away. He adored all of them, and somehow without ever learning how to install a mod. And he loved none more than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Skyrim</em></a></span><em>.</em> After he died, one of the admin jobs I had to do was sort his PC, which was still logged into his Steam account. He had <em>hundreds</em> of hours on <em>Skyrim</em>. Although the “1,263 hours on record” for <em>X-COM: UFO Defense</em> suggests that maybe he left that running in the background rather often. Video games had been a permanent accompaniment for him (along with my mum, I should probably add) for 35 years.</p><figure id="" data-id="1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-recommend-id="image://1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="896" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Margaret Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-recommend-id="image://1abd5bb5c5f38d4b1e739f47d7f51f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="896" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hugh Walker, in a red top, lit by a garish flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My dad was a good man. One of the true ones. He was normal, he messed up, he sometimes made bad choices (he bought an Atari ST instead of an Amiga for goodness sake), and he and I shared similar struggles with anxiety and mental health. But he was a truly <em>good</em> person, who would fight for those with less, who was capable of changing his mind when he recognized his own prejudice, and who made sure the people around them knew they were loved. He had a solid grounding in his morality, and I knew he was there for me, had my back.<br></p><p>I very strongly remember in 2015, just under a year before he died, and very shortly before he retired, a great example of his just being there when I needed him.

I had spent the day receiving some of the most horrendous abuse on Twitter and in my email and via my website. At the same time, I had terrible toothache and—with some irony—had to travel across the country to Guildford, where my parents lived, and where Molyneux was based. And dad just understood. He knew I had done the right thing, that I had stood up for what was true and fair, and he made that clear to me. He hugged me, he made me feel safe. He also fixed my tooth.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-recommend-id="image://c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexus Mods / Elianora</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-recommend-id="image://c474f8e8a1b299e89d4dfc262c8aafbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Another picture from the mod an RPS reader made in tribute to Hugh." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All the way until his untimely end, we would chat about video games. As dad got older, his interests narrowed, and his tolerance for burgeoning genres lessened. Despite loving the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> so much, he bounced off of <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>4</em>. I would tease him for just replaying the same five games over and over, and especially for his habit of endlessly restarting things like <em>Civ</em> until he found some impossible perfect route. He was the sort of person who’d finish every RPG with a backpack full of potions that he was saving for the right time, then start over and do the exact same thing again.<br></p><p>But we did overlap one final time. It was the completely wonderful <em>Legends of Grimrock</em>, a traditional dungeon-crawling RPG made in tribute to the mighty <em>Dungeon Master</em>. It was so perfect, evoking the memories we both had from 1987, of him playing that game on our Atari ST sat at the kitchen counter, and me, nine years old, watching in awe.</p><p>I was playing an early review copy of <em>Grimrock</em>, and managed to get the lovely developers—Almost Human—to send me a second pre-release Steam code so dad could play too. I then commissioned him to write about it for <em>RPS</em>, leading to a series of completely barmy articles called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-dad-in-a-dungeon-part-one&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-dad-in-a-dungeon-part-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dad In A Dungeon</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed120678788981134635a45e2f217c1d" data-recommend-id="image://ed120678788981134635a45e2f217c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="899" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dad looking swish on holiday in Greece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dad looking swish on holiday in Greece." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Margaret Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed120678788981134635a45e2f217c1d" data-recommend-id="image://ed120678788981134635a45e2f217c1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="899" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dad looking swish on holiday in Greece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I really miss dad. Obviously I miss having my father, miss being able to talk nonsense with him on the phone or in person late into the night, and I lament the loss of the vast amounts of knowledge he carried. But the thing that brings this home for me more often than anything else is video games. He would have played <em>Starfield</em>. He would have had a lot more patience for it than I do, and likely motivated me to stick with it past its abysmal beginning. He would have watched Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em>, but been incapable of discussing it without repeatedly explaining to me why he didn’t get on with the games. For some reason, Firaxis carried on making <em>Civilization</em> games after he died, which doesn’t even make sense to me. Why did they bother with <em>VI</em>, when dad was never going to get to play it? I want to pick up the phone and pester him to stop being stupid about it and play <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. And you know what? I absolutely cannot remember if he ever played <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and there’s literally nothing I can do to find out.<br></p><p>What do I want anyone to get from this meandering, shapeless thing? Honestly, that you learn my dad was a good man. He deserves people to know. And that such a person eventually goes away, often very suddenly. It’s worth knowing. Thanks dad. Happy Father’s Day.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-722<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            
<p>Sundays are for hoping the plumber has ordered that new sink part in. My sink is ‘non-standard’ apparently. "Why can't I just be normal?!" I scream in silent longing. Armitage Shanks would never. Before I look forward to no longer having to wash up my pasta bowl in the same place I brush my teeth, let’s read this week’s best writing about games (and game related things!)</p>

<p>For <a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made">Aftermath</a>, Luke Plunkett spoke to ‘Albert’, an anonymous industry vet, about the struggles of making a demo for a big showcase or event - despite sometimes knowing it’s “100% Grade A Bullshit”.</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, now that I think about it, I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production, we had an external team create a trailer to build hype. It was completely divorced from anything we hoped to do, and it was so early in development that it couldn't help but be misleading or tie our hands. That one sucked. It thankfully didn't eat up a ton of our resources and time, but it was still demoralizing because we had little to do with it and we all knew it was going to be promises that we couldn't necessarily deliver on.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2024/06/06/supergiants-scrappier-better-underworld/">Unwinnable</a>, Jay Castello wrote about “Supergiant’s Scrappier, Better Underworld.” That being the landscapes and characters of my favourite Supergiant game, Pyre.</p>
<blockquote><p>But unlike the spaces of the Hades games, the Downside is not an infinite labyrinth of rooms, filled only with enemies (and the occasional Charon store). The Downside is a world. Escaping it is a journey that takes the Nightwings through a variety of jewel-toned, hazily lit environments, each with their own moods. It necessitates the wagon, a home base that feels simultaneously comforting and crowded. And it gives all the characters a sense of grounding, a place in the world that lends them important narrative weight.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/06/reinventing-the-pdp-10">The Guardian</a>, Keith Stuart chatted to the enthusiasts creating a replica of the PDP-10 mainframe computer - the same series on which prehistoric game SpaceWar! was designed.</p>
<blockquote>The attention to detail is wild. The lights on the front aren’t just for show. As in the original machine they indicate the instructions being carried out, a smattering of CPU signals, the memory contents. Vermeulen refers to it as watching the heartbeat of the computer. This element was taken very seriously. “Two people spent months on one particular problem,” says Vermeulen. “As you know, LEDs flick on and off, but incandescent lamps kind of glow. So there was a whole study to make the LEDs simulate the glow of the original lamps. And then we found out that different lamps from different years had a different glow time. Measurements were done, math was applied, but we added lamp glow. More CPU time is spent on simulating that than on simulating the original CPU!”</blockquote>
<p>House Of The Dragon is back! The first season was great! I can understand if you’re twice shy by this point, but I think you should give it a shot. You could just absorb it all by proxy through Glidus’s <a href="https://youtu.be/uh8fpm4liB8">excellent recap videos</a>, though.</p>
<p>‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LR511iAedYU">Orientalism: Desert Level Music vs Actual Middle-Eastern Music</a>’ is a video Brendy recommended after a chat about Metal Slug Tactics.</p>
<p>Ed sent me this. While you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, why not play <a href="https://woe-industries.itch.io/fromsoftword?ref=warpdoor.com">FromSoft Word</a>? ‘The Dark Souls of word processors. One typo, and it's game over.’ I’m so mildly amused by it that I don’t even mind such flagrant simplification of FromSoft’s design ethos. In this seven hour long video essay I will…</p>
<p>Music this week is <a href="https://youtu.be/QmRwov11nkw">Previous Industries</a> by Open Mike Eagle, Video Dave and STILL RIFT. I once had an illuminating conversation with Open Mike outside a show about linguistic determinism and the work of Robert Anton Wilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/R3ib9gCw1F4">Ziggy Starfish</a> is still the vibiest song ever written about social anxiety. Thanks, Michael Eagle, and thank you readers. Have a great weekend!</p>

			<p>Will the upcoming Gears of War E-Day have a multiplayer mode like previous installments in the series? The Coalition talked about it in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The Coalition and Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted a stunning trailer</a> for E-Day during last week's Xbox Showcase. Yes, it turned out that this trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-trailer-wasnt-rendered-in-real-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn't in real-time</a>, but it has many excited nonetheless. Since the release of the trailer, fans have been wondering whether E-Day will also include Gears' iconic multiplayer mode. In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/will-gears-of-war-e-day-have-multiplayer-what-about-gears-6-the-coalition-gives-us-some-hints-at-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new interview</a> with WindowsCentral, Creative Director Matt Searcy briefly touched on the subject, and while he didn't directly confirm multiplayer, he did provide some hints.</p>
<p>"I would say, this is the next mainline Gears game," the Creative Director said when asked about multiplayer, "Gears has a pretty clear DNA for gameplay modes, so you can probably anticipate where we'll be going with E-Day."</p>
<p>Based on this reply, it's pretty likely that E-Day will offer a fan-favorite multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, further in the interview, Searcy and Brand Director Nicole Fawcette also mentioned the story arcs of Gears 4 and Gears 5. After all, many Gears fans expected The Coalition to announce Gears 6 after the events of Gears 5. This, however, didn't happen and the team announced a prequel. Luckily for some, The Coalition isn't deserting the story of Gears 4 and 5, as emphasized by Fawcette.</p>
<p>"We're focused on this and pouring everything we can into it right now, what the next game is will be for us to decide in the future," Searcy said. Fawcette added, "We're not retreating from the stories of Gears 4 and 5, though. We just spent time thinking about the stories we want to tell, and we can flex the franchise from both sides. We're excited about telling this story, and hopefully, fans will love this story too."</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[700,000 People Are Clicking a Banana on Steam to Make Money]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/700-000-people-are-clicking-a-banana-on-steam-to-make-money.902652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>That’s one of the strangest titles I’ve written in a long time, but it’s the way of the world. In recent days, a bizarre game on Steam has snowballed in popularity – Banana. The premise of this game is that players click on a banana until they earn new bananas. That’s it. But there’s a huge twist at play – users will periodically earn random banana skins (that’s clever) of varying rarities with which they can turn a profit, selling them in Steam’s marketplace to other users.</p>



<p>The problem is, that the developer has recognised that the vast majority of the 700,000 peak players recorded on Banana are bots. With this game using ‘less than 1%’ of your computer’s resources, people are setting up thousands of fake profiles to run this clicking-based game in the hope of securing and selling rare banana skins, which are quickly growing in value.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-secure-the-skins">Secure the Skins</h2>



<p>Presently, the most expensive banana skins to be sold on the marketplace have reached more than $1,000, which is why users with armies of bot accounts are getting involved. In an interview with Polygon, the game’s developer admitted it’s a ‘legal infinite money glitch’, and the team was pondering how long it’ll take before Valve steps in to shut the game down. </p>



<p>Here’s the gameplay loop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open Banana</li>



<li>Click the on-screen banana</li>



<li>Earn drops</li>



<li>That’s it</li>
</ul>



<p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, the developer confirmed that when the player count was 141,000, only a third of those players were <strong>real</strong>. The rest were bots. While most users are selling their banana skins for single-digit cents, some have made hundreds of dollars through Banana. Also, the developer is pushing the community engagement aspect of the game, stressing that users are contributing their designs to the pot, which is indefinitely increasing the number of banana skins available for unlock.</p>



<p>On Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Banana is ranking higher</a> than Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and GTA 5 in terms of its overall player count, even if the majority of those ‘players’ are bots driven by auto-clicking functions.</p>



<p>What a world.</p>

<p>As the video says at the start, RePop lets players choose between "Original mode", which maintains the grindhouse violence of the cult hit original, or the RePop mode which replaces some of that violence with "pop-art damage effects."
</p>
<p>It's one of several changes designed to make RePop the "definitive version of the game", according to producer Yoshimi Yasuda. RePop will also have faster load times, support for 4K resolutions and 60 frames per second.
</p>
<p>RePop was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lollipop-chainsaw-is-getting-a-remake-out-2023">announced back in 2022</a> with a summer 2023 release window, but soon slipped into 2024. We haven't heard much about it since, and what has been shared has been cause for concern. Original developers Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suda51-and-james-gunn-arent-back-for-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake">aren't involved, and neither is original writer James Gunn</a>, who is fairly busy making superhero movies these days.
</p>
<p>Perhaps most worringly of all, RePop isn't expected to include the original soundtrack, which included licensed songs from Skrillex, The Human League and MSTRKRFT, among many others. Yasuda has said that the original soundtrack will be replaced, and will only include "a few licensed tracks".
</p>
<p>I never played Lollipop Chainsaw at the time, because it seemed the wrong kind of dumb. (For the record, Revengeance and Bayonetta were the right kind of dumb.) It also only got middling reviews, although its style and bombast seem to have earned it a cult following in the years since, like many Grasshopper games. Maybe this September is when I finally give it a go.</p>

            <p>League Of Geeks are going "into hibernation". The Australian developers behind fantasy strategy games such as the animal-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a> and hellish remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/solium-infernum">Solium Infernum</a> said that their remaining staff are going to take an extended break, and they're not sure "when (or if)" they will revive the studio.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"With over 13 years under our belt as an entirely independent studio, and the economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off," says <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months.
</p>
<p>"We’re not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we’re incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved, both in the experiences we’ve crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions."
</p>
<p>Solium Infernum released earlier this year to strong reviews - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solium-infernum-review">including our own</a> - but the remake of Cryptic Comet's niche, famously complex roleplaying strategy game has not achieved sales strong enough to fund further development or DLC, League Of Geeks say.
</p>
<p>There were already signs of trouble for League Of Geeks late in 2023, when the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jumplight-odyssey-development-suspended-indefinitely-as-league-of-geeks-face-redundancies">paused development of early access spaceship colony sim Jumplight Odyssey</a> and laid off half the studio. At the time, League Of Geeks cited rising operating costs, the weak Australian dollar, and poor sales, and said they'd be focusing on the then-imminent launch of Solium Infernum as the last best hope of securing the studio's future.
</p>
<p>The announcement of the studio's hibernation confirms that Jumplight Odyssey has "not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development." Instead they're planning to bring the game out of Early Access in t he next 12 months without the "fully realised v1.0 release" they had orignaly planned.
</p>
<p>"Makin’ videogames is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years, but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."</p>

            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wizard-with-a-gun">Wizard With A Gun</a> are closing down. Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they'd run out of time to find funding for a new project.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Despite the promising start of Wizard With A Gun, sales are  not strong enoguh to sustain our studio," said the <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112">announcement shared on X</a> by company founder Patrick Morgan. "The last year has been particularly tough for games. While we had numerous encouraging conversations at DICE and GDC, the process of signing new projects, even in a good year, takes longer than the runway we had left."
</p>
<p>Wizard With A Gun was published by Devolver Digital, which Morgan described as a "dream come true for us." Morgan also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207451502972477440/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207451502972477440%2C7207451937464569857%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207451937464569857%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207451502972477440%29">shared a post on LinkedIn</a> which points to some of the Galvanic Games team members who will now be looking for work.
</p>
<p>Playable with 1-4 players and with an obvious combat-focus, Wizard With A Gun was also reminiscent of Don't Starve in its camera perspective, art style and collect-and-craft survival mechanics. It seemed to be well received when it launched in October last year, but the game-playing audience is fickle. Wizard With A Gun has a couple of thousand Steam reviews and a very positive rating, compared to the superficially similar Cult Of The Lamb, published by Devolver Digital the previous year, which has over 67k. 
</p>
<p>Galvanic Games released two games before Wizard With A Gun, including futuristic point-and-click Some Distant Memory, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-some-distant-memory">resonated with Katharine as we entered lockdown back in March 2020</a>.

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>series is hailed for its impressive storytelling, iconic characters, and emotional impact. From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Not counting <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, which is <a href="https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-gb/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">due to come out later this year</a>, the <em>Life is Strange </em>series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the <em>Life is Strange </em>games in chronological order.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-farewell-episode-dlc-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Farewell Episode DLC (Life is Strange: Before the Storm)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2008</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>timeline begins with a pair of departures that impact Max and Chloe, the protagonists of the original two games, for years to come. The episode’s content goes by quickly and can be completed in under an hour. It’s best to play this after playing the original game, but you don’t necessarily have to finish the other parts of <em>Before the Storm </em>first.</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2010</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><em>Before the Storm </em>is a prequel to the first game that tells the story of Chloe’s relationship with Rachel Amber, the teenager who has gone missing when the events of the original game unfold. Together Chloe and Rachel ditch school, navigate trauma, and uncover family secrets.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2013</p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Life is Strange </em>game features iconic storytelling, a beautiful soundtrack, and a cast of deeply drawn characters. In addition, Max’s ability to reverse time and change the outcome of every scene gives the player’s decisions serious weight. At the end of your quest to save Arcadia Bay, you’ll make a final critical decision that affects the rest of the universe’s timeline.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-comic-series" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange (Comic Series)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Starting in 2014</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://life-is-strange.fandom.com/wiki/Life_is_Strange_(Comic_Series)">comic book tie-in series</a> for the <em>Life is Strange </em>games begins about a year after the events of the first game, and takes place over the course of six story ‘arcs’. In order they are: Dust, Waves, Strings, Tracks, Coming Home, and Settling Dust. The comic series follows the Bae (not Bay) ending of the first game, but is in many ways a divergent timeline from the other games to come. &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-1-amp-2" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: October-December 2016</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The direct sequel game in the series follows two brothers, Sean and Daniel, as they journey south from Washington to the US-Mexico border. When their father is killed by a police officer, Daniel’s telekinesis powers aid the pair in escaping danger.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit</strong></h2> <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="34" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: December 2016</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"><em>Captain Spirit </em>is a short demo game that allows players to learn more about Chris, a side character encountered by Sean and Daniel near the end of the second episode of <em>Life is Strange 2. </em>This chapter in the <em>Life is Strange </em>universe is often forgotten because it’s not as essential to the main story, but it’s worth playing nonetheless.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-3-5" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 3-5</strong></h2> <p data-characters="45" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">Year it takes place: December 2016- June 2017</p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">The conclusion to Sean and Daniel’s story occurs over the course of many months, but also features flashbacks that bring players back to events that occur before the game starts.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-wavelengths-dlc-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Wavelengths DLC (Life is Strange: True Colors)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

In many ways, this DLC is just as much a sequel for <em>Before the Storm </em>as it is a prequel for <em>True Colors.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: True Colors</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

There are plenty of twists and turns here, and Alex’s superpower fits her story remarkably well.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Unknown</p> <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">In <em>Double Exposure</em>, the original protagonist of the series Max Caulfield makes a welcome return. This time, we’ll be opening parallel universes in an attempt save her friend Safi. It’s apparent from Max’s character design in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOYz4NCFIXg">the reveal trailer</a> that several years have passed since the first game, and we know that she’s a photographer in residence at a university, but for now, the exact dates for the events of this game are unknown. From what we can see, however, it seems likely that this game is the furthest forward in the timeline.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-how-many-life-is-strange-games-are-there" data-injectable="false">How Many Life is Strange Games Are There?</h3> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Counting <em>Double Exposure</em>, which comes out October 29th, 2024, there are six games in the Life is Strange universe. However, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>and <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm </em>are available together as a single remastered collection on select consoles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-which-life-is-strange-game-should-i-play-first" data-injectable="false">Which Life is Strange Game Should I Play First?</h3> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="false">If you are new to the series, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>is undoubtedly the best place to start.

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">From speedrunning to interesting mods to porting the games in unusual ways, <em>Doom</em> persists because it transcends the pixelated world built by its original developers. Now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/"><em>The Dark Ages</em> has been announced</a>, id Software’s iconic series is once again in the public eye.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">Although, it never really stopped being part of the wider gaming conversation. As a series, <em>Doom</em> has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it’s stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">With the new game on the horizon, I thought it was time to remind ourselves just where it all began. This <strong>brief history of <em>Doom</em></strong> aims to reflect on the early days and how it’s managed to remain impactful after three decades. And for once, I will make sure I don’t talk about how old all this makes me feel (this sentence notwithstanding, of course).</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-an-era" data-injectable="false">The beginning of an era</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="589" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="true">Let me say this first to just get it out the way: the original <em>Doom</em> was not the first ever FPS to be developed and released. That title doesn’t even go to <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, which came out the year before and was also created by id Software. You need to go way further back than the 90s. According to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/95409-first-first-person-shooter-fps-videogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guinness World Records</a>, the first ever first-person shooter was <em>Maze War</em>, which came out in 1973. Much of what came during this period has largely been pushed to the wayside thanks to time, but it’s a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-complete-history-of-first-person-shooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascinating read</a> if you’re ever in the mood for a gaming history lesson.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">The genre has only been growing ever since those heady days, but it was the original <em>Doom</em> (and, to some extent, <em>Wolfenstein</em>) that popularized 3D gaming, especially in the guise of a newfangled thing called an “FPS”. <a href="https://in.ign.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/134891/feature/most-impactful-fps-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> referred to the 1993 release as the “father” of the modern shooter, noting its fast-paced action and mindless violence, which would eventually catch the attention of fans and the media (see also: <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100412024424/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979298,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat</a></em>).</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">A sequel – <em>Doom 2: Hell on Earth</em> – was released in 1994, which kept much of its predecessor’s aesthetics and mechanics, but added in new monsters and weapons, including the now-legendary Super Shotgun. An expansion called <em>Master Levels</em> was released in 1995, as was an updated version of the first game called <em>Ultimate Doom</em>.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">While the two main entries alone solidified their place in PC gaming history, it was arguably the 1993 OG that had the most impact. Since then, these classics have been ported across many platforms over multiple generations, which also includes some pretty <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/literally-mow-down-demons-as-doom-comes-to-this-robotic-lawnmower/">gnarly ports of the origina</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sink-your-teeth-into-a-port-of-doom-playing-on-a-smart-toothbrush/">l <em>Doom</em></a>. As such, getting hold of a copy of the old <em>Doom</em> games is not exactly hard. Accessibility is probably one of the reasons we’re still talking about these retro titles to this day.</p>
 <h2 id="h-that-wobbly-bit-in-the-middle" data-injectable="false">That wobbly bit in the middle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">Had <em>Doom</em> stopped in the mid-1990s, with two critically acclaimed releases under its belt, it would still have left its mark on the industry, given how influential it’s been. It led to the evolution of the first-person shooter, which seemed to tie in nicely with advances in gaming technology. Without it, we probably wouldn’t have <em>Quake</em> (another banger from id Software), which implemented full 3D models, <em>Half-Life</em>, which changed the way FPS narratives were told, or <em>Unreal</em>, which brought about visuals that were seen as unprecedented at the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">But <em>Doom</em> carried on. In 1997, a Nintendo 64 game was released. Because it was locked to a single console, it didn’t have as wide an impact as its predecessors at the time. It has, however, gone down as something of a cult hit. It also wasn’t developed by id – instead being helmed by Midway, which was also responsible for bringing <em>Quake</em> to the N64 – but it wasn’t a port, either. Instead, it was its own standalone release with a new story that aimed to carry the baton for the original entries.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Then things went quiet for a few years, until <em>Doom 3</em> launched in 2004. Now, technically <em>Final Doom</em> (released in 1996) was the third main installment, but you can class that as part of the first era of the series. I do, at least. Also, it was developed by the now-defunct TeamTNT. So for argument’s sake, we’ll say the third game was the early 2000s one.</p> <p data-characters="663" data-current-count="1028" data-injectable="true">Things had moved on in the FPS genre at this point. <em>Half-Life 2</em> was yet to come out, but <em>Halo</em> had been kicking about the place for a few years and was something of a game-changer. As such, <em>Doom 3</em> had to be pretty special to stand out. And stand out it did, but maybe not to everyone’s tastes, for it swapped out the high-octane action for something more horror-based (though it still had action). Maybe not everyone liked this direction the series had gone in (personally, I did), but it kept the <em>Doom</em> name in the limelight. At least for a little while. It also made use of the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">id Tech 4 engine</a>, so it had some pretty advanced visuals for the time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-great-comeback" data-injectable="false">The great comeback</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">Look, for the sake of brevity, I’m skipping a few details here. In the interim before the big reboot, we got <em>Doom Resurrection</em> – which was an attempt to turn the franchise into a survival horror – as well as a couple of <em>Doom</em> RPGs (yes, seriously). But outside these, there wasn’t a lot going on until <em>Doom 2016</em> made an appearance.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">Many of you are probably aware of this already, but for those who aren’t, we very nearly got a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-4-was-canceled-because-it-felt-too-much-like-call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty</em>-style <em>Doom</em> game</a> at one point. During the development of a fourth installment in the mid-2000s, parent company Zenimax pulled the plug and instead asked the studio to do a reboot of the series. And that was what we got in the end. You can see early footage from the cancelled project below.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Unreleased DOOM 4 [cancelled] &amp; DOOM 2016 Development Gameplay" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uvb04gU_UmU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom 2016</em> was such a success because it was a return to those glory days of the 90s when it was all about the insane action, the brutal violence, and the sheer chaotic spectacle of it all. Sure, it was visually on par with the modern era, but it retained a lot of that fast-paced shooting that many of us grew up with thanks to the classics. It was also nice to play something where you felt like the most dangerous one among a horde of bloodthirsty monsters. Power fantasies, man.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom Eternal</em> came in 2020, right before much of the world went into lockdown I hasten to add, and was as well-received as the previous game. Having recently replayed it myself, I think <em>Eternal</em> is great but has a number of flaws that stop it from being on the same pedestal as the 2016 reboot (first-person platforming, anyone?). Whatever your thoughts, <em>Doom</em> was truly back, and we now know it’s not going away any time soon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-and-here-we-are" data-injectable="false">And here we are</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via id Software/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">I’ll admit, I don’t quite know how to feel about <em>The Dark Ages</em>. On the one hand, it’s a new entry in the continued success of one of gaming’s most influential series. On the other, a third installment can be tricky to pull off, retaining what made the previous entries special while keeping things fresh. Generally, I like to think I’m keen to try it out when it releases next year.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">But it represents one more chapter in the <em>Doom</em> saga, a timeline that stretches back to the mid-1990s, when fresh-faced developers like John Carmack and John Romero were cutting their teeth in a relatively new industry. Not many other franchises can say they can comfortably keep the lights on for a solid 30+ years. Of course, id Software is not the studio it was back in the day, with people departing and new teams forming, but it counts itself as one of the big developers.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">But the fact is, the story of <em>Doom</em> is one that will live on for a very long time. Who knows for how long, really? But there’s a reason why the name crops up in lists of the most influential or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most impactful FPS games</a> of all time. That goes for both the classics and the modern reboot. Both old and new are typically amongst some of the best in the business, and that’s not an easy feat.</p> <figure data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Many of us grew up playing the earlier games, so to see <em>Doom</em> still kicking it decades later is like a parent watching with pride as their child makes it in the big, wide world. When some young programmers and designers from Louisiana got together to start making games, there’s no way any of them could possibly have visualized just how far that ambition would take them.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="false">I don’t want to get too sentimental or hero worship-y about all this, because it is just a game, after all. Had <em>Doom</em> never come to fruition, would another name have emerged and we’d be talking about that instead? We’ll never know, but this is the timeline we’re living in and id Software is a studio that will forever be associated with thrusting the first-person shooter into the mainstream. Here’s hoping <em>The Dark Ages</em> can continue the legacy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rpg-fans-are-eating-well-for-several-years-to-come/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>2023 was a memorable year for fans of RPG titles, and the foreseeable future looks brighter than ever after the recent Summer Game Fest event. The biggest contribution comes arguably from Xbox Game Studios, thanks to Microsoft's investments in some of the most successful RPG studios and franchises. But there's a lot more coming to market - let's take a look at the next couple of years, beginning with the latter half of 2024.</p>
<p>In the action/soulslike (or lite) subgenre, players can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> (out next week), the one and only expansion to 2022's game of the year. We've already said so much about this one that it's not worth dwelling too much on it, but feel free to check out our recent hands-on preview in case you missed it.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: Siege of Dawn</a>, the new game from Ashen developer A44. Its fantasy world mixes magic and supernatural with firearms while taking visual cues from the studio's home country of New Zealand. The 'wide linear' game will be released on July 18, and Game Pass subscribers will get it as a complimentary addition to their library on day one.</p>
<p>Just over a month later, Chinese developer Game Science has scheduled its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong.</a> This is a reinterpretation of the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. Players will be asked to play as the monkey-like 'Destined One' creature, who sets on a journey across beautiful landscapes to uncover the truth behind an old mystery. To defeat his many foes, designed out of Chinese mythology, the Destined One will have to master his staff's techniques while also wielding spells and abilities and acquiring powerful gear.</p>
<p>Another action RPG scheduled for August is <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> by Square Enix. In this game, players explore a semi-open world with a party of three characters, all of whom can be directly controlled. Each character has different combat classes, which can be unlocked by acquiring items called Spirit Vessels and can be changed at will, giving them access to new abilities and powerful attacks called Class Strikes.</p>
<p>Going back to the soulslite genre, Italian developer Jyamma Games has set a September 19 date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-gets-another-short-delay-demo-out-next-week-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enotria: The Last Song.</a> Far removed from the gloomy atmospheres championed by FromSoftware, Enotria takes place in a sunny world inspired by Southern Italy, though that doesn't mean there aren't ominous enemies to conquer. You can play an updated demo right now on Steam.</p>
<p>Fans of Japanese-made RPGs will get their highlight in October when Atlus plans to launch the long-awaited new IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. With turn-based combat inspired by Persona and a medieval fantasy world called the United Kingdom of Euchronia that somehow mirrors the modern world, the game will also allow players to develop intimate relationships with their&nbsp;character's companions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Vampire-the-Masquerade-Bloodlines-2-Stare-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Gamers who prefer Western-style roleplaying games will undoubtedly find what they're looking for between these four heavy-hitters: Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, BioWare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-gorgeous-new-saints-sinners-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a>, and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sees-its-debut-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines II</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous titles mentioned in this article, these four underline the R in RPG by allowing players to shape the world around them and the storylines through choice-based gameplay, potentially leading to major differences and even multiple endings.</p>
<p>Despite this similarity, there are some key differences. Avowed, set in the fantasy world of Eora (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity games), can be played in either first-person or third-person view. It features a party of three characters, although the action is focused on the main character and there is no tactical pause. However, players can quickly swap their loadout in combat as required by the situation, switching from a two-handed ax to a sword and a Grimoire, for example. While interacting with companions and befriending them is a major part of the game, there won't be any romance.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard takes place in the fantasy world of Thedas, following more or less directly from the plot of 2014's Inquisition. The game is played from a fairly close third-person camera to enhance immersion. Like in Avowed, the party size is three; however, The Veilguard lets you pause the action and issue orders to your companions to activate specific skills against the targets on the battlefield, potentially enabling devastating combos. The game also allows players to romance any of the seven companions, regardless of the main character's race or gender, and there will even be some nudity.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance II, on the other hand, is set in a purely medieval world, more specifically, 15th-century Bohemia. Unlike the previous two RPGs, this one is not party-based and features a fixed protagonist (the same as the first installment), Henry from Skalitz, who's on a revenge mission against Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, responsible for the destruction of his village and the death of his parents. Kingdom Come Deliverance II is only available in first-person view. Moreover, its unique directional combat system certainly sets its apart from the other games, though the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it will be a bit more accessible.</p>
<p>The last of the Big Four Western RPGs in 2024, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines II is also the one that raised the most concerns due to its highly troubled development phase. A new studio (The Chinese Room) was brought in following the split with Hardsuit Labs, but they don't exactly have a track record in the genre. Anyway, like Kingdom Come Deliverance II the game is played in first-person view and does not rely on companions. Players will step in the shoes of an Elder vampire who was mysteriously put into slumber for over a century. They'll be able to choose gender, appearance, backstory, and clan, the latter of which will influence the kind of powers and abilities at their disposal. Clans Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue will be playable at launch, with two more set to be added later.</p>
<p>Finally, cRPG fans will want to take note of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Arc Line</a>, a steampunk/fantasy turn-based game from Ukrainian indie studio Dreamate Games. It's slated to launch later this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fable-trailer-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, roleplaying game aficionados can look forward to many interesting projects even going into 2025 and beyond. At Summer Game Fest 2024, Playground <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that its Fable reboot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> with the collaboration of Eidos Montreal) would launch at some point next year, and the in-engine trailer certainly had fans excited to return to the city of Bowerstone after a long time.</p>
<p>We didn't see it at this Summer Game Fest, but last year inXile's steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution made a big impression with a gameplay trailer, and a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> it may indeed launch in 2025.</p>
<p>Next year is also when Spiders plans to release GreedFall: The Dying World out of early access. This game has transitioned from action to tactical gameplay; you can read more about that <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the fresh preview.</a> The Gothic Remake is also currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> to launch by March 2025 at the latest, with more information likely coming this August at gamescom. Indie game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, also slated for 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitely caught our attention</a> at Summer Game Fest thanks to its unique setting and mix of turn-based and real-time combat. Lastly,</p>
<p>Finally, Q4 2025 is the expected launch window for Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy, the new fantasy cRPG from the makers of the old Fallout-style games Atom and Atom: Trudograd. The game was crowdfunded last month <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atomrpg/swordhaven-iron-conspiracy?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Swordhaven" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kickstarter</a> and will enter early access in Q4 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Elder-Scrolls-VI-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Looking at 2026 and farther into the future, there's a few triple-A RPG titles already lined up: the remake of The Witcher, in development at Fool's Theory; the new The Witcher 4 game, in development at CD Projekt RED, just like the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel; Bethesda's Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5; BioWare's new Mass Effect; and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2. On the AA spectrum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/outward-2-qa-director-says-sequel-is-a-few-years-away-will-be-just-as-cruel-obscure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outward 2</a> is also worth mentioning, as well as the indie Daggerfall-inspired <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wayward Realms</a>, which was just funded on Kickstarter. Many more games will doubtless be announced over time, but even with just those listed here, fans of roleplaying games will have thousands of hours worth spending in these increasingly lifelike virtual worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-atlus-enhanced-edition-ranked-shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance<em> </em>is finally here! Branded by developer ATLUS as the “definitive” version of the game, it promises to expand on the original with iterated mechanics, new characters, and a new storyline that revolves around the Qadištu faction; which consists of demonic women who, depending on who you ask, are either evil or are wrongfully scorned by society. This game seems to be an expansion at all costs, though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-5-to-be-delisted-from-nintendo-eshop-next-month"><u>ATLUS is delisting the original Shin Megami Tensei V from the Nintendo eShop on June 13th</u></a>. This has left many questioning ATLUS’s penchant for releasing enhanced versions of their games and if they’re always good enough to merit the soft erasure of the original version of the game.  </p><p>That’s why this article is going to dig into every enhanced version of a game in ATLUS’s discography, and sort them from worst to best for some added fun. ATLUS has a long history of releasing games this way, and there have been both missteps and back steps in crafting rereleases that truly improve upon the base game. By looking at what’s worked and what hasn't, it’ll become easier to evaluate Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance as a new take on the original, rather than assume it’s the new and improved version of the original title. </p><p>As a clerical note before kicking this list off, ports from one platform to another do not count as an enhanced edition and will not be included in this list. There has to be a significant material change beyond the device the game runs on for a game to meet the “enhanced” criteria. So the likes of the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection will not be included here, but the reimaginings of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the Nintendo 3DS will be discussed. </p><h3><strong>19. Growlanser (remake)</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2012/01/19/growlanser-iv-wayfarer-of-time-20120118052459104-3589750.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Growlanser series of games are a consequence of the Career Soft division of Mayasa Games split away from the Mayasa brand, and partnered with ATLUS to create a spiritual successor to the still ongoing Langrisser franchise. They’re tactical RPGs with a distinctly shojo visual style, and the entire franchise is viewed as a bit of a cult classic by people who are, both, way into anime and tactics games. </p><p>The Growlanser enhanced remake for the PSP is at the bottom of this list, though, because it <strong>BIZARRELY </strong>was never released outside of Japan. Growlanser 2, 3, and 4 were all localized but, in spite of their mixed to favorable reception, the Growlanswer enhanced remake remained a Japan-only title. As there’s no legitimate way to play this title outside of Japan, it can’t be discussed further or evaluated higher. </p><h3><strong>18. Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment for the PSP</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Persona 2 duology (treated here as a single entry as this is already a pretty long list) has always been a bit of a black sheep in the Persona series. While segments of the older fanbase love it for its queer themes, catching art direction, and distinct setting; the games never really got </p><p>a fair shake outside of Japan. </p><p>The original version of the first game, Innocent Sin, was never released outside of Japan; making the second game, Eternal Punishment, the international entry point. This was flipped for the PSP enhanced remakes, though, where the upgraded version of Innocent Sin was available globally but not Eternal Punishment. Honestly, these games are in desperate need of Persona 3: Reload style remakes, and hopefully this lower ranking will encourage that kind of updated release. </p><h3><strong>17. Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/06/etrianodysseyuntold21600jpg-67c0e1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Etrian Odyssey series is made up of some of the best games around for dungeon crawling sickos. In a similar vein to Square Enix’s Dungeon Encounters, the Etrian Odyssey games heavily prioritize gameplay loops like exploring and mapping dungeons, turn based combat, and managing the economy of running a guild over any kind of narrative. Which is why it’s strange that the enhanced edition of Etrian Odyssey 2 tacks on story mode that detracts from the focus of the original title. </p><p>There’s a reason that ATLUS decided to use the base versions of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the recent Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection, and it's because the “enhanced” part of Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight feels more like an ancillary add-on than something that builds upon the game’s strong points. </p><h3><strong>16. Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Everything about the enhanced version of Etrian Odyssey 2<em> </em>is applicable for the enhanced version of<em> </em>Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl, which also focuses on story content. So, go re-read that first paragraph and a half if you want a quick rundown of why this title is also fairly low on this list. </p><p>The Millennium Girl<em> </em>beatus out The Fafnir Knight, though, because this 3DS enhanced edition actually scored a few Metacritic points higher than its original version. Whether this is a statistical quirk or an indication of genuine improvement is unclear, but that’s enough of a reason to rank The Millennium Girl one slot higher than its sequel. </p><h3><strong>15. Catherine: Full Body</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/09/23/03-1537680347210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Catherine series is a bit of a minefield. On the one hand, it’s action-puzzler gameplay, adult cast of characters, and supernatural murder mystery plot make it feel like it was tailor made for older Persona 4 fans. On the other hand, many objected to the casual bigotry levied towards trans characters in the original release, and trans and gender nonconforming characters in the Full Body enhanced edition.    </p><p>In fairness, plenty of people did find the gender expression of the marginalized characters in both versions of Catherine to be inspiring too. However, this game is also a prime example of ATLUS’s on-again, off-again, “more is better” enhanced edition philosophy; where over-encumbering a game with more story and levels is treated as a superior experience. Bigger, of course, does not always equate to better and this added material detracts from the tighter experience of the original Catherine.</p><h3><strong>14. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/wiiugeneiibunrokufescrn03e3jpg-bfd659.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As a crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei games with a focus on idol culture, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE<em> </em>is a game made for very specific segment of the gaming audience. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore<em> </em>does a solid job building upon the original, even if piled on characters and story content can feel like it’s putting a hat on top of a hat. </p><p>The US and Japanese release of this game were mired in a bit of controversy, though, which knocks it down a few ranks on this list. Tokyo Mirage Sessions is the source of the infamous “vagina bones” meme, which is both hilarious out of context and still potent shorthand for localization changes around the sexualization of characters. Additionally, all versions of Encore were based on the Western version of the original game, meaning that the more risque content of the Japanese version of the original did not appear in any version of the enhanced edition.</p><p>While that content is definitely a weird thing to be left on the cutting room floor, removing material whole cloth definitely works against the idea of an “enhanced” edition of a game. </p><h3><strong>13. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor is a tactics based spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise for the Nintendo DS. Think Persona 5 Tactica, but with an original cast of characters. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked<em> </em>is an enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS, that adds the compendium mechanic featured in most mainline games, and even adds voice acting! </p><p>While these more deliberate and mechanically focused add ons are in the spirit of what make enhanced versions of games worthwhile, they don’t quite work cohesively in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked. In fact, the enhanced version of this title actually has an aggregate review score that’s a few points lower than the original version of the game, so it falls to the bottom half of this list. </p><h3><strong>12. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/12/10/smt-record-breaker-desu2jpg-8775bf.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The sequel to Devil Survivor, aptly named Devil Survivor 2, also got an enhanced edition in the form of Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker. While this 3DS enhanced edition did mostly boil down to additional content after the original game’s ending, this enhanced edition was reviewed more favorably than its base version. Between this higher critical reception, and the fact that characters from the Durarara!! anime inexplicably appeared as DLC characters in the enhanced edition, Record Breaker<em> </em>narrowly beats out Overclocked on this list. </p><h3><strong>11. Persona 5: Royal</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/04/24/persona-5-royal-1556114898757.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>For as much as Persona 5: Royal is seen as the definitive version of the game that brought mainstream acclaim to the long running series, it actually exacerbates some of the original’s biggest issues. While it’s great to spend more time with Akechi after he outs himself as a lil freak, and Sumire’s storyline is certainly moving; Royal tacks on at least fifteen hours of gameplay to a title that already bridged into a triple digit runtime. </p><p>While both Persona 5 and Royal are great games, the pacing and repetitive writing are low points and Royal’s tacked on third semester can make the game feel like even more of a slog. While more of a great video game sounds ideal on paper, it’s not as appealing when most of the additional content doesn’t address underlying issues. I’ve said it before, but when it comes to Shin Megami Tensei games, there’s a difference between “more” and “enhanced” and that’s why Royal is in the middle of the pack in this ranking. </p><h3><strong>10. Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/07/1-1496872814814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux<em> </em>is a pretty standard enhanced edition as far as ATLUS games go. There are some new demons, quality of life changes, an additional dungeon, and a new character that also brings some new endings. What makes Redux a better than average ATLUS enhanced edition is the timing of its release more than its content, though. </p><p>SMT: Strange Journey Redux came to the 3DS a little over a year after the original version of Persona 5, and about seven months after the release of the Nintendo Switch. So not only did it capitalize on the growing interest in the broader SMT franchise, but it also breathed a last bit of life into a sunsetting console. It’s important to remember that “enhanced editions” of games are, on some level, marketing tactics; and Redux deserves props for releasing as interest was peaking and on a ubiquitous piece of hardware about to fall into irrelevancy.</p><h3><strong>9. Maken Shao: Demon Sword</strong></h3><p>Maken X is a hack and slash game for the Dreamcast and was also the directorial debut of Katsura Hashino, who would go on to direct Persona 3, 4, and 5. The game also received a manga adaptation by Q Hayashida, the famed mangaka behind series like Dorohedoro and Dai Dark. </p><p>While Maken X received a mixed at best reception, the Maken Shao: Demon Sword enhanced edition earns a higher spot on this list by transforming the first person action game into a third person action game. While the enhanced edition doesn’t quite come together cohesively, this change had to be a massive undertaking and offers the kind of refreshed experience that makes enhanced editions worthwhile. </p><h3><strong>8. Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/08/18/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-hd-remaster-51125672274-o-1629329279415.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Did you know that the version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne that most people outside of Japan are familiar with is actually an enhanced version of the game? Dubbed the Maniax edition and often referred to as a Director’s Cut, and included the famed cameo of Dante from the Devil May Cry series. This version of the game also featured the enhanced difficulty that the title, and future SMT games, would become known for. </p><p>Is it a little weird to include an enhanced edition that most people know as the default version of the game so high up on this list? Yes, but also Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax<em> </em>got the ball rolling for the slowing growing popularity of the SMT and Persona franchises, so Maniax deserves this recognition and praise. </p><h3><strong>7. Persona 3: FES</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/12/18/persona-3-wallpaper-hdjpg-c73627.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: FES is the first enhanced edition of Persona 3, and is the first time a Persona title got this kind of upgrade. Today it can more or less be viewed as the template from which later enhanced editions of their games would draw upon. FES adds story content beyond the ending of the original game, and cleans up a lot of backend technical issues. </p><p>While FES is a rock solid foundation from which ATLUS has developed their enhanced game identity, there are better versions of Persona 3 that you can play right now and therefore this game falls a bit short of the top five on this list. </p><h3><strong>6. Persona 3: Reload</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/21/persona3reloadaigistrailer-ign-blogroll-1700577589695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Reload has enough graphical changes and quality of life improvements to make it as much of an enhanced edition as it is a remake of the original game. Also, with ‘The Answer’<em> </em>content from FES on the horizon as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-announced-xbox-partner-preview"><u>DLC</u></a>, it’s  starting to feel more like a refresh of the enhanced edition than just a remake of the original game. This version of Persona 3 is far and away the easiest way for fans to experience the title that would influence the franchise for more than a decade to come. </p><p>That being said, some of the changes in Reload work against the intent of the original game. Reload borrowers the peppier visuals of Persona 5, which undermine the melancholic tone and themes of the original game. This enhanced version makes the game more approachable, but less distinct, and an enhanced version of a game should build a title up rather than squeeze it into a popular mold. </p><h3><strong>5. Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Radiant Historia<em> </em>was a rock solid turn based role playing game that had the misfortune of releasing internationally in 2011, when global interest in those kinds of games was at an all time low. This means that, despite resoundingly positive reviews, not many played the title; making it a prime candidate for an enhanced edition that could give it another chance to shine. </p><p>Perfect Chronology for the 3DS does just that while also adding animation from the famed A-1 Pictures studio, voice acting, and quality of life changes that sped up gameplay. Sure, the new story content felt a bit tacked on, but it’s difficult to pick up on that if you aren’t familiar with the original release. Ultimately, Perfect Chronology does exactly what an enhanced version of a game should; which is to further polish what worked in the original and build upon the momentum of the previous release to take a title to even greater heights. </p><h3><strong>4. Persona 4: Golden</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/28/nintendoswitch-persona4golden-screenshot-2-1656445494022.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 4: Golden is one of the best enhanced editions of a game ATLUS has ever made because I can’t think of a single reason why someone should play the base version over this edition. Does the added story content pad out the runtime? Yes, but the game can still be beaten in around 80 hours, which is the sweet spot for these kinds of sprawling RPGs. Golden also adds new cutscenes and character interactions, which is more than welcome for a game that thrives on the quality of its character writing. </p><p>Chances are, though, that you already knew that Persona 4: Golden<em> </em>was one of the best enhanced games in ATLUS’s catalog. Even as the Persona 5 games have become the new hotness and many people’s gateway into the franchise, Golden remains the gold standard in which all other ATLUS games are measured. </p><h3><strong>3. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona for the PSP</strong></h3><p>The PSP remake of the original Persona game, titled Revelations: Persona on the PS1, is definitely a strange pick for one of ATLUS’s best enhanced editions, but it’s here for good reason. Did you know that only half of the original Persona game was ever released in the US? No, this isn’t a Persona 2 situation where a sequel/prequel was left unlocalized; half of the story in the first Persona game was removed in the Western release! </p><p>Dubbed the Snow Queen route, this storyline leans into the urban legends elements that would go on to make the Persona franchise so endearing. With this content restored in the PSP enhanced edition of Persona, the game is made complete and becomes even more of a gem that new fans should check out. The game’s more grounded, biblical apocalypse setting still feels novel today and this version of the game enhances the base game more than any other title on this list. </p><h3><strong>2. Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/04/27/5jpg-652ae5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What happens when one of the best games made by ATLUS and Vanillawear gets an enhanced edition? It becomes arguably the best game to come out of either studio. Odin Sphere was a cult classic that was deeply influential to all who played it, as evident by American folk band sensation The Mountain Goat’s hidden track, “Enoch 18:14”<em> </em>on The Life of the World to Come album. Leifthrasir brought the action RPG to a broader audience as the best version of itself. </p><p>In a departure from most other enhanced editions on this list, Leifthrasir makes no story changes to the base game and instead focuses on graphical improvements and refining gameplay systems. In perfectly recognizing what worked and the base game and what could be refined, Leifthrasir is the ideal of what an enhanced edition of a game should be, and is only by an enhanced edition that goes well above and beyond what is reasonable for this kind of release. </p><h3><strong>1. Persona 3: Portable</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/10/xbox-game-pass-in-january-2023-1673360336609.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Portable<em> </em>lets you play as a girl and date the male cast characters present in the game. While that might sound like a small change, it’s actually a fairly large undertaking from a writing and coding perspective and is probably the reason enhanced editions of later Persona games haven’t had that feature. However, this change indicates that the team behind it knew exactly what was appealing about the original Persona 3, and enhances that experience without any form of detraction. </p><p>The main appeal of Persona 3, or any of the modern Persona titles, are the characters. In playing the game you get to experience some of the best character writing in the games medium, and you’re left wanting more time and new experiences with these characters by the end of it. P3P does just that, as giving the player the option to play the game with a character of a different gender identity, lets you see new sides of established characters and connect to them in different ways. </p><p>Between this brilliant recontextualization of the game and some battle mechanic updates to make it play more similarly to Person 4, Persona 3 Portable is the best enhanced edition that ATLUS has ever put out. While it would be a phenomenal undertaking for ATLUS to iterate upon other games to this degree for future enhanced editions, no game better encapsulates everything associated with that kind of release than Persona 3 Portable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Be sure to check out IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">review of Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</a> for our take on the most recent Atlus expanded re-release.

            <p>Wizard With a Gun developer Galvanic Games is closing down.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to the Seattle-based studio's social media channels, president and founder Patrick Morgan said the announcement was made with "a heavy heart" and the "irony of spending a decade building [their] ideal team, only for it to end after [the team's] most productive year".</p>

<p>"Despite the promising start of Wizard With a Gun, sales are not strong enough to sustain our studio," Morgan said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>"Working with Devolver Digital was a dream come true for us. Together, we created a game I'm incredibly proud of. There is a certain bittersweetness to knowing that we accompanied all the things we set out to do when we founded Galvanic in 2015. From launching unique, weird, and interesting games to collaborating with some of my favourite people in the industry all while building a tight-knit productive team focused on a healthy and creative culture."</p> <div>

<p>"However, it is incredibly difficult to see our team facing the uncertainty of the current market. I may never get over the irony of spending a decade building my ideal team, only for it to end after our most productive year. The dedication, creativity, and hard work of every person on our team have been nothing short of extraordinary."</p>
<p>Morgan closed by thanking the team and players for "the support and memories", and <a href="http://v/">shared a list of the LinkedIn résumés and portfolios</a> of devs affected by the closure.</p>
<p>In response, Devolver Digital simply said: "Love you all".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>It's unclear how many jobs have been affected by the closure.</p>
<p>Galvanic's closure is just the latest in an long  line of studio shutdowns and redundancies, and marks an unflinchingly miserable time for games and the people who make them. By the end of May 2024 – so not even halfway through the year – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year across the video game industry</a>.</p>
<p>When Ed wrote the article above at the end of May, 10,000 people had lost their jobs in the games industry. Now – just 15 days later – that total has increased to 10,800. For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning more game devs have been impacted by the layoffs so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>
<p>In June alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">Just Cause developer Avalanche</a> shut two of its five offices and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">League of Geeks</a>, the studio behind Armello, Jumplight Odyssey, and Solium Infernum, recently announced it was going into "hibernation for the foreseeable future", following its decision to cut 50 percent of its workforce at the end of last year.</p>
<p>"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.</p>

  <p id="EnQ78F">The moment Pixar revealed the first new characters in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems"><em>Inside Out 2</em></a>, fans of the animation studio started arguing about the film’s basic conceit. 2015’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review"><em>Inside Out</em></a> centered on five characters who represent the basic emotions of an 11-year-old girl named Riley: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. In the sequel, Riley hits puberty on her 13th birthday, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess">new emotions</a> suddenly take form in her head: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment">Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui</a>. Fans of the first film had a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/17tsr9x/inside_out_2_is_adding_new_emotions_and_thats_bad/">questions and complaints</a>: Aren’t these emotions just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1crtsxr/why_did_pixar_feel_the_need_to_introduce_new/">minor variants of the existing ones</a>? Why are they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/18nrsz3/why_are_there_no_new_positive_emotions_in_inside/">all negative</a>? And above all, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment">why weren’t any of these emotions</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/y1asuu/is_it_just_me_or_does_insideout_2_having_new/"> around in the first movie</a>?</p>
<p id="vV1FxM">Of all the concerns, that last one seems most legitimate: <em>Inside Out</em> took viewers inside many different heads, but only found the original five emotions there. There’s been a lot of theorizing about how <em>Inside Out 2</em> would reconcile that seeming continuity error. In the end, though, the new movie really doesn’t address it. And you know what? It’s fine. It’s not a big deal. And it certainly isn’t a reason to reject a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review">thoughtful, emotionally powerful movie</a>. Here’s why.</p>

<p id="7x7X5B">The complaint about the new emotions holds water. While the concomitant arrival of puberty and feelings like anxiety and embarrassment is both a source of humor for the movie and an invitation to empathize about how hard it is to be 13, it does bring up a lot of the world-building questions Pixar fans <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23762172/elemental-pixar-cars-comparison">love to gripe about</a>. Once the new movie acknowledges Anxiety as a separate emotion from Fear, with her own problems and her own agendas, it raises a lot of questions.</p>
<p id="RDTrTS">The biggest one comes from one of <em>Inside Out</em>’s best gags: a closing-credits montage that rushes into many other minds, to see what the balance between the five basic emotions looks like for other people. (Plus a cat and a dog.) Once <em>Inside Out</em> director Pete Docter has established the movie’s <a href="https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1663-inside-out/">complicated visual language and symbolism</a>, he uses this kind of look into other people’s heads to say things about the human experience in pretty subtle ways.</p>
<p id="xyUcCQ">In Riley’s head, Joy is in charge, to the point where she loudly resists and resents any input from Sadness. But in her mother’s mind, Sadness is positioned as the leader of the group, which she runs like a respectful, thoughtful committee. And Riley’s father is piloted by Anger, a brusque military type who treats all the other emotions like lower-ranked officers. Both of these decisions help the audience understand Riley’s parents in a surprisingly intimate way. But mostly, the peeks into other people’s heads are just for quick-burst humor. The fact that we see into so many heads and never see Anxiety there does feel weird in retrospect, and it spoils the joke about how people are so internally similar, yet so wildly different.</p>

<p id="3GwlSa"><em>Inside Out 2</em> does address this discrepancy in a very small way, with short gags where adult versions of Anxiety pop out from behind a curtain to address the five original emotions inside Riley’s parents’ heads. Those moments — one of which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4DrolmDxmw">included in the film’s final trailer</a> — is an obvious after-the-fact fix, a “We were here all along, you just didn’t notice us” explanation that isn’t particularly convincing, given that any other emotions hanging out in Riley’s head certainly would have at least been consulted during the chaos of the first movie. But honestly, it doesn’t really have to be convincing, because strict, doctrinaire continuity just is not important for the Inside Out movies.</p>
<p id="p68O4U">Both Inside Out movies are built around emotional truths, not literal ones. And the emotional truth here is that when Riley faces problems she’s never faced before — the vast hormonal changes of puberty among them — it <em>feels </em>like she’s not just experiencing brand-new emotions, but that they’re taking over. Much like the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996520/turning-red-panda-meaning">magic panda transformations in <em>Turning Red</em></a>, the conceit of new emotions showing up is metaphorical and centered on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">the experience of becoming a teenager</a>. It isn’t a scientific map of the brain. And it’s concerned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems">first and foremost with Riley’s subjective experience</a>, not with psychoanalyzing the rest of the world. </p>
<p id="AITFPG">Director Kelsey Mann and his co-writers (including <em>Inside Out 2</em> co-writer Meg LeFauve) aren’t saying adults never experience embarrassment or envy. But they also can’t retroactively refit <em>Inside Out</em> to fit their story. That’s a purely practical, mechanical problem — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23180299/obi-wan-kenobi-show-age-fictional-character-played-by-actors">the kind of thing that sometimes necessarily happens in franchises</a> — rather than an error of carelessness or of the new filmmaking team not understanding the original property. It’s worth taking creators to task over continuity when they <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/5/14/21249881/gargoyles-animated-series-disney-plus-greg-weisman-interview-oj-simpson-goliath-chronicles">take over a beloved story and get the tone or characters entirely wrong</a>. But it feels beside the point to ding them for not having invented time travel.</p>

<p id="6Ulong">Yes, Mann and company could have insisted on making a movie that only uses the original film’s characters — but they would have risked falling into the usual “more of the same, but louder” problem that sequels so often have. Instead, they <a href="https://time.com/6987825/inside-out-2-neuroscience/">talked to psychologists and a neuroscientist</a> about how puberty affects the brain, and built a story that acknowledges those changes and how they can feel. And yes, they could have strained for a solution that eventually melds the new emotions into the existing ones — Anxiety and Embarrassment dissolving into Fear, Ennui into Disgust, and Envy into Sadness — but that wouldn’t necessarily have felt true to the human experience either.</p>
<p id="6IsfND">For some people, the new emotions may be a narrative deal-breaker, and that’s fine — adding new characters to a new iteration of an existing story can sometimes be a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23755642/transformers-movie-deaths-rise-of-the-beasts">mercenary decision</a>, a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">lazy one, or both</a>, so it’s reasonable to be dubious. For people suffering from their own anxiety in particular, it may be frustrating to have that experience glossed over as something that doesn’t happen to adults, except in the meekest and most minimal terms.</p>
<p id="741ttJ">But instead of totting up this break in continuity for a CinemaSins-style roundup of unforgivable flaws, it’s worth considering everything that went into it, and how little effect it has on the many meaningful ways these two movies interact with each other, beyond making a few scattered gags land less effectively. And it’s also worth considering how well <em>Inside Out 2</em> works on its own merit, in terms of exploring how these new emotions interact with each other, and what that means to Riley’s life and her relationships with other people.</p>
<p id="sAMSlP">After all, Mad Max creator George Miller thinks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity">strict franchise continuity isn’t as important as telling a compelling story</a>. Why should we? </p>

The current Mac <em>Resident Evil </em>games are essentially a dedicated showcase of just how powerful the M-series chips and integrated graphics cards can be, especially on devices such as the Mac Book Air, which don’t have a fan.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-games-for-mac-available-now" data-injectable="false"><strong>Resident Evil Games for Mac Available Now</strong></h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">Mac and iPhone users can currently purchase both <em>Resident Evil Village </em>and the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake via their device’s App Store. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> on Mac in particular is a spectacle to behold; I can personally vouch for its impressive performance on the M1 Mac Book Air. While there have been a few audio glitches here and there, the port is exceptionally well optimized.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">The <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake on M1 devices also has generally positive reviews on the Mac App Store, though users should note that you’ll need approximately 125 GB of free space on your drive to install the game, which is nearly double the listed size requirement in the store.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-upcoming-resident-evil-games-for-mac" data-injectable="false"><strong>Upcoming Resident Evil Games for Mac</strong></h2> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">The <em>Resident Evil Biohazard </em>Mac and iOS port is currently slated for July 2nd, 2024. However, Capcom has also announced on <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/apple/en-us/">its Apple games page</a> that it will be bringing the <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>remake to all M-series Apple devices as well. We don’t have a release date for this one yet, but if the previous Mac <em>Resident Evil </em>ports are anything to go by, it’s sure to be an exceptional experience.</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After choosing to save the children in a recent Major Order, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have been showing a softer side of themselves. Through <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/oil-on-canvas-helldivers-2-paintings-manage-to-romaticize-the-absolute-hell-that-is-spreading-managed-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan art</a> that usually shows memes or epic landscapes, players are instead highlighting those they fight for in the Helldivers universe. </p> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">Usually, Major Orders are little more than flavor text that justifies playing more <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Yes, they add to the story, but the gameplay is what we’re all here for, and if we can make it into just one more mission by shouting, “Won’t someone please think of the children?!” then we’re absolutely going to do it. Right now, though, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are experiencing a more somber mood, sharing artwork that commemorates the children and civilians they save on a daily basis, not just in the recent Major Order.</p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-players-show-a-different-side-of-themselves-after-choosing-to-save-children" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> players show a different side of themselves after choosing to save children</h2> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit</a>, players are sharing some of the most heartful fan art I’ve seen for the game to date. some of it’s genuinely making me tear up and want to dive in so I can save more fictional people from their fictional deaths at the hands of the Automatons. </p> <figure data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dftetn/devs_can_we_have_this_on_the_wall_of_our_ship/">VanuVampire</a> shared the first and probably most popular image of a child’s cartoon of them and a Helldiver after being saved from certain death. They ask, “Devs, can we have this on the wall of our ship please?!?” which I don’t think is unreasonable. </p> <figure data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dg60r1/final_hours_on_vernen_wells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TurnMajestic8035</a> shared some fan art of a Helldiver clutching a child in the final hours on Vernen Wells when as many children as possible were saved in the name of freedom, democracy, and a brand new Stratagem. This one gets me, but not as much as the one below. </p> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dgadie/remember_why_we_dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">misterwot</a> shared a pixel art scene that just breaks me each time I see it. The image shows Helldivers coordinating rescue operations for civilians while Super Destroyers fly in overhead to deliver more democracy to the Automaton menace. </p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Something about these powerful warriors being so gentle and helping people with horrific injuries into beds and around a medical camp is just too much for me to bear. The Helldiver at the back holding a child’s hand through all this hits on a scary level because of the world’s conflicts right now.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Even the memes have some heart behind them. This one from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dg6b14/awesome_job_securing_the_future_of_democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domkesslr</a> is a conversation between an Automaton and a Helldiver, but the Helldiver is speaking so much truth on multiple levels. In both the satirical universe of <em>Helldivers 2</em> and the real world, the children are the future.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">I don’t want to leave you on a downer, so I’ve included this meme, posted by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfspv6/isnt_that_sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KurnaKovite</a>, which shows how some members of the community hopped on saving the children as the Major Order because they thought it would be funny but ended up having a hugely positive impact on everyone they play with as well as the developer that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-succeed-in-their-rescue-operation-with-the-dev-donating-to-charity-and-hinting-the-mines-arent-out-of-reach-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donated money for every child saved to Save the Children</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, in-game messaging, and dialogue paint a satirical version of humanity’s future. Super Earth citizens are encouraged to sign up to spread freedom and manage democracy by killing robots and giant bugs without ever questioning authority. As the icing on the cake, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">families are even charged for the return of</a> whatever pieces of their loved ones are left, provided they didn’t help create a new black hole or something else fairly substantial. </p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="false">This is a moment for the community, though. While they may not all realize it, the choice to prioritize saving children has opened up everyone’s heart and made them see the innocent lives that are so often lost in the Second Galactic War. Super Earth will undoubtedly rally the troops to get more oil gushing from the Terminids soon enough, but it can’t take away from the fact that its democracy-spreading machines of war just shed a tear and showed some compassion for once. </p>

<p>That's according to Sony's own metrics and a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/playstation-store-may-2024s-top-downloads/">new blog post</a> which revealed that Rare's 2018 swashbuckler tops the PS5 chart after Xbox finally brought the game to its competitor's system at the end of April.</p>

<p>Other Xbox Game Studios games like Grounded, Fallout, 4 and Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 – which is also now owned by Xbox, of course – also take spots in PS5's Top 20 downloaded games run-down, and Minecraft still dominates the PS4 downloads across all three territories, too.</p>
<p>"F1 24 is off to the races in May's PS5 list by entering the top 3 of most downloads in the EU region, with Sea of Thieves ascending the list in both the US and EU regions," the blog post explains.</p>
<p>"The PS VR2 list saw new release Madison VR enter the fray of most downloads in May."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/pocketpair-assures-fans-official-palworld-merch-is-coming-if-they-can-wait-a-little-longer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pocketpair-assures-fans-official-palworld-merch-is-coming-if-they-can-wait-a-little-longer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As any fan of <em>Palworld</em> will tell you, the game is ripe with possibilities for merch and goodies to decorate our homes. From plushes to figurines, clothing and even terrifying nightmare fuel, if you look hard enough you’ll be able to find everything <em>Palworld</em> related, but none of it is official merch.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Posting on Twitter this morning, Pocketpair has assured that there is indeed some official merchandise on the way, if fans can wait a just little longer to get their hands on it.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🎀Pal Merch!🎀<br>Official Palworld merch has not yet been released.<br>All the merch currently on the market is unofficial. </p><p>We are currently working hard to make official merch for you all, so please wait a little longer! <br>(A sneak peek at the stuffed toys currently in… <a href="https://t.co/7RMavOytL1">pic.twitter.com/7RMavOytL1</a></p></div>— Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1801608541473751095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Accompanying this plea was a purposefully faded image of a Cattiva plush, giving fans something to get excited about. However, the comments were mostly focused on fans asking for their favorite Pal in plush form – although a staggering lack of those are after a Depresso plush, I must say.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-unofficial-palworld-merch-is-hit-or-miss" data-injectable="false">Unofficial Palworld merch is hit or miss</h2> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">It’s safe to say there is a lot of unofficial Palworld merchandise out there. A quick search for “<em>Palworld</em> merch” on Google will prove that the internet is positively overflowing with plushes and clothing that is almost good, but just not quite right. There’s a scale of not quite right, starting with wonky-eyed plushes and going all the way to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-players-left-horrified-by-nightmare-fuel-aliexpress-items/">sleep paralysis demon costumes</a> I wrote about a while back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The demand for <em>Palworld</em> merch is obviously there. There’s a whole string of websites dedicated to selling unofficial merch from the game, and they’re all sold out of plushes, so that’s got to say something for how much fans want these items in their homes.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">The problem here is that every player has a different favorite Pal. Of course there are some Pals with a larger fanbase, like Chillet, but there is a Pal for every person. The only way to keep every plush-loving player happy would be to bring out a line of plushes for the entire <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-many-pals-are-in-palworld-complete-paldeck-pal-list-so-far/">Paldeck</a>, which may prove problematic, especially considering the ever growing number of Pals.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="false">I’m just hoping for an official Depresso plush who can keep me company while I hide away from the world, avoiding human contact.</p>

<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Horror requires a certain degree of unpredictability to really succeed. That can be difficult when you’re trying to keep things believable, so why not throw believability in the trash can?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em>Anthology for the Killer</em> is a compilation of nine previously available, completely absurd, short-form horror titles that have decided, as many of us have, that reality really sucks. But while there’s a heaping dose of comedy mixed inseparably with the rest of the horror stew, the pure discomfort of not finding a reliable grip is enough to make you sweat. Or whatever people do when they’re afraid.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><strong><strong><strong>Anthology of the Killer (<a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>)<br>Developer: thecatamites<br>Publisher: thecatamites<br>Released: May 29, 2024<br>MSRP: $6.00</strong></strong></strong></p>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">The <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> staples together nine related short horror games going back to 2020. They were first available (and still are) on <a href="https://gamejolt.com/@garmentdistrict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamejolt for free</a>, but the anthology will run you six American greenbacks, which sounds like a reasonable fee to not have to juggle executables. Plus, there are some pretty great extras thrown in. Also, the weird art showing party that links the games together is pretty great.</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Each of the stories follows BB, a woman who lives in a city where murder is routine. Some cities have rat problems, XX City has serial killers. While she and her sister ZZ pay the rent by plumbing the decaying depths of the city’s dead shopping malls for kitsch from decades gone by, BB also publishes a zine about spooky happenings. I feel like that’s something anyone going through YouTube dependency withdrawal would do.</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">The stories of the anthology are generally framed around her seeking out content for her zine, which is a great way to get a protagonist to willingly delve into dangerous situations, but that’s rarely how things begin.</p> <figure data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">It’s not uncommon to have the word “dreamlike” applied to a work of fiction. It’s usually shorthand for the weird and surreal. But I don’t think I’ve seen one come closer to actually resembling a dream than <em>Anthology of the Killer</em>. Some of the stories are extremely evocative to what my subconscious will present to me on any given night; usually when I have a high fever.</p> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The first story has BB walking you through a day at the call center. It’s disjointed, the police show up, and the conclusion is rather nebulous.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">One of the stories has her doing her civic duty and acting in a play. However, the chapter is not framed like the acts of the story. She just wanders through various scenes connected by twisting corridors until she gets the sudden urgent goal of finding the script to learn her character’s motivation.</p> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="905" data-injectable="true">It’s these disconnected, warped depictions of otherwise familiar places and things that give it the quality of something you’d wake up from, drenched in sweat and gripping the bedsheets. I’d completely believe it if I was told that these stories were based on dreams. In my dreams, I’ve been late for class, but my high school was combined with a grocery store for some reason. The class in question was in the bread aisle. I obviously don’t know what everyone else’s dreams are like, but for me, the structural similarities are enough to put me in the same discomfort I feel on bad nights.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, much of its dialogue and narration is sharp and lucid. Even with the bizarre environments, the writing is very straightforward, laced with dry, referential sarcasm. That’s important for the dream aesthetic too, I think. After all, how common is it to wake up from a horrific nightmare only to realize that none of it made sense and was only scary in the context of itself?</p>
 <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The chapters that make up <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> are simply walking sims. The only real action and challenge here is when you need to escape from pursuing killers. Most of the time, you’re largely just walking around and looking at stuff. Observing the environment often comes down to walking into little hovering bubbles to hear BB’s thoughts. She’s a great guide through the game’s weirdness, often talking as though the things she sees are obvious or expected. Rarely are you given the whole picture, but she makes sure you aren’t lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">It’s a bit weird for a walking sim to have its character on screen at all times, and I should warn you: you aren’t in control of the camera. It follows you around, sometimes in a fixed direction, but it has a habit of getting confused. This is especially true in the early episodes. Often, you’ll walk past a camera cut and not know which direction you’re supposed to be moving. A lot of the chases require you to run toward the camera, and it’s not well-signposted where you’re supposed to turn.</p>
 <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">In a lot of these chases, you’re supposed to be caught eventually, so it doesn’t matter in terms of the bigger picture.</p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> is the culmination of at least three years of work, you get to watch as they improve mechanically. The problem there is that the first couple of chapters that it throws at you are rather rough. They get better over time. The first experience isn’t <em>bad, </em>and the second is my favorite, narratively, but you only get one chance to make a first impression.</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">Also, watch your fingers around the ESC key, since that will boot you out of the current chapter without warning and with no way to resume,</p> <figure data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">While <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> is disturbing in its surreal, nightmarish way, I’d be hesitant to say it’s scary. At least not in the conventional sense. It doesn’t try to get your heart rate up, but, in a way, it’s more effective in that sense. Its sketchbook serial killers aren’t likely to be the part that sticks with you. Instead, it’s the aloof confidence that it presents its otherworldly horror.</p>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">Shortform horror is well-established within the indie sphere, and you can generally find whatever niche or subgenre you’re looking for. From RPG Maker narratives to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-stay-out-of-the-house-puppet-combo-pc-lofi-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raunchy slasher horror</a>, hobby developers have stuck their fingers in a lot of scary places. But through slick and enjoyable writing and a surreality of its own, <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> manages to be more than just another corpse on the pile.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-science-fiction-book-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-science-fiction-book-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The joy found in science fiction novels is, of course, entirely subjective. Some love a series that keeps things only galaxy-wide, spanning maybe only a millennia. Others prefer multi-dimensional, million-year space epics. To keep this ‘best of’ list fair, I have tried to pick some of my favorite all-time science fiction book series that cover all bases.</p> <h2 id="h-10-wayfarer-series-becky-chambers" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/JxiqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#10 Wayfarer Series – Becky Chambers</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">The Wayfarer Series by Becky Chambers is one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recently published </a>science fiction series on this list, but it still deserves its place. For anyone new to the genre, it is a fantastic gateway into the world of space-based drama and adventure. </p> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">Becky Chambers brings the notoriously galaxy-spanning stereotype of sci-fi and reduces it down to three relatively small worlds. Her first book, ‘A Long Way to A Small Angry Planet’, is based almost entirely on a single spaceship, bringing the reader on a journey to a remote planet destined to set the crew up for life. The first book in the series is a wonderful character study, using the medium of aliens and AI to create some fantastically diverse characters. </p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://geni.us/JxiqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">next two books</a>, which are planet-based, follow loosely on from this. Without giving too much away, both of these novels look at the complexity of the human spirit when confronted with people who are outside of their comfort zone. They dissect love, prejudice, fear, and many other very human emotions, using the science fiction backdrop to really delve deep into what makes us… human?</p> <h2 id="h-9-the-expanse-james-s-a-corey" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/T3oB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#9 The Expanse – James S. A. Corey</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Earth is a bloated and failing planet, Mars has become a technocratic threat, and the asteroid belt hosts a vast population of long-limbed outcasts. James S. A. Corey has created a universe in which he has based a phenomenal nine books delving into the conflicts, relationships, and adventures that revolve around these three populations.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/T3oB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Expanse books</a> stray away from becoming wildly futuristic, instead focusing on the technology we have now, or maybe in the not too distant future. For some, this realism isn’t what they’re looking for in the best science fiction series, but for others, it gives the series the verisimilitude it requires to truly connect.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The Expanse has everything you need from a magnificent space opera, with space battles, politics, relationships, a looming alien threat, and warring factions. If you’re looking for something that may very well take years to read, The Expanse saga won’t leave you wanting. However, if you’re finished and looking for something similar, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-the-expanse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have you covered</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-8-the-forever-war-series-joe-haldeman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/A53Sk4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#8 The Forever War Series – Joe Haldeman</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="827" data-injectable="true">Haldeman is a veteran of the Vietnam War, and I feel this trauma and disillusionment come through in his collection of Forever War science fiction narrative very clearly. In this <a href="https://geni.us/A53Sk4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">collection of books</a>, interstellar has become possible through ‘collapsers’. However, doing so will only take moments for the traveller but years in real time. These are used to transport troops across great distances to fight with the alien ‘Taurans’.</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">The first book follows Mandella’s path as he goes through his training and is sent to war on a distant planet with an enemy he has never met. While only two years pass for him, almost 30 pass on earth. When he returns after his tour of duty, the earth has changed. His disconnection from a world he once remembered leaves him ‘travel shocked’, and he finds himself completely unable to reassimilate, driving him to sign up for another tour, once again leaving his family and world behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The books focus on the way the world moves forward over and over again, leaving Mandella to return to civilizations he no longer recognizes. He is ostracized and outcast despite his many accolades. The books expand on the tragic ways in which war can change a person. I feel The Forever War has deep elements of Joe Haldeman’s personal experience and provide a view into the world of a veteran from a tragic science-fiction perspective. </p>
 <h2 id="h-7-enders-game-orson-scott-card" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ahLZZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#7 Enders Game – Orson Scott Card</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Depending on how deep you want to get into the monstrous Enders Saga by Orson Scott Card, the story can span five books or 20. Ender’s game, or at least the core five <a href="https://geni.us/ahLZZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Ender’s Series books</a>, follows Ender as he first fights a war that leaves him in possession of perhaps the last hope of the civilization they wiped out in the form of an egg.</p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Amazon </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="631" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">Over the next few books, years pass, opinions on the war change as Ender writes the story of the now-extinct Formics, and humanity spreads itself across the galaxy. The Ender’s Universe, even over the first five books, is vast, infinitely complex, and incredibly engaging. Summing it up can’t be done in a few brief paragraphs. If you are looking for a science fiction saga that spans generations, planets and includes vast and complex ideas, this is the one to pick up. The Ender’s Game saga is magnificently written and infinitely in-depth, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rarely not included</a> in any ‘best of’ science fiction list.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-douglas-adams" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/fcWUV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#6 Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy – Douglas Adams</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">For something light-hearted yet still written with incredible skill and world-building, there are few science fiction sagas better than <a href="https://geni.us/fcWUV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to The Galaxy</a>. Douglas Adams puts us in the shoes of Arthur Dent, a regular, everyday Englishman who has been robbed of his home planet and left drifting through the universe.</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">While the idea of hitchhiking from planet to planet may be many science fiction readers’ dream, for Arthur Dent, it is all just a bit annoying. Douglas Adams wrote this collection of books with the dry humour and satire that is only found in English writers. The worlds and concepts that the books produce are hilarious and incredibly inventive. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Each of the books in the series is a gem in itself, introducing amazing new characters and concepts. Although wildly alien, the world beyond the borders of our atmosphere still suffers from many of the problems we face today. Having Earth turned to rubble for the sole reason of building an ‘Intergalactic Highway’ is one of my favourite planetary destructions in science fiction of all time. </p>
 <h2 id="h-5-commonwealth-saga-peter-f-hamilton" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0zjv4OB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#5 Commonwealth Saga – Peter F Hamilton</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton is a <a href="https://geni.us/0zjv4OB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">monstrous pair of books</a>, but ones that I tore through. These two novels take us through a serious case of ‘curiosity almost killing the cat’. When a star mysteriously disappears from the sky, a spaceship is sent to find out why.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">A Dyson sphere surrounds the sun, enclosing it completely. However, when it is approached, it disappears, releasing a genocidal hive-mind alien into the universe, previously trapped for everyone’s good. The next few books cover the relentless spread and devastation of this all-encompassing life form.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">These books highlight the futility of war against an alien life form that is phenomenally better suited to genocide than even humans. The sense of fear and dread that Hamilton creates in this science fiction saga is second to none for me. The foul, polluting, planet-devouring parasite that begins its journey to ‘The Commonwealth’ is truly an alien to fear.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">These books create a universe rich in action, relationships, politics, and difficult decisions. Despite their vast length, they rarely feel like they drag and will keep you flipping pages cover to cover.</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-hyperion-cantos-dan-simmons" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/IPtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#4 Hyperion Cantos – Dan Simmons</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">Dan Simmons breaches many topics, from religion to sex and everything in between, in his Hyperion Cantos. Although the first two books mostly focus on the lives of the central five characters, as the science fiction saga opens up, so does his universe.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/IPtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos saga</a> presents us with a universe populated by humans, a seemingly benevolent AI, and other humanoid but friendly aliens. Humanity has spread itself across galaxies, utilising the wormhole technology provided by AI. However, there are factions of aliens who choose to remain separate from AI, and war is breaking out.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">On the planet of Hyperion, tombs are opening up, moving backward through time, and with them is coming an evil never before witnessed by humanity. As the time tombs start to emerge, alien forces fight over the control of Hyperion. </p>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">The Hyperion Cantos explores where this evil is coming from, who created it, and what humanity can do to save itself. Dan Simmons is not afraid to go big when it comes to the events in his science fiction saga, creating some of the best ‘Oh Shit’ moments of many in this list. The saga spans thousands of years and shakes up everything the foundations of the first books lay out.</p> <h2 id="h-3-dune-frank-herbert" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/nY1qLA5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#3 Dune – Frank Herbert</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true">Hell, you can’t have a ‘best of’ science fiction saga list without <a href="https://geni.us/nY1qLA5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">good old Dune</a> on there, can you? Sandworms, future sight, rebel forces, and interplanetary genocide are always going to be a recipe for a good time. Frank Herbert created six books before his death, and then his son capitalised and wrote three preludes after.</p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">These books take you on a journey based around the production of Spice, a material only found on the planet of Arrakis. This Spice powers interstellar travel and provides extra sensory perception, making it one of the most treasured resources in the universe.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">However, there is a boy prophet. The Dune series covers the rise from a small freedom fighter cell to galactic-wide genocidal warlords of the inhabitants of Arrakis under the guidance of a boy hopped up on huffing interstellar spaceship fuel. The writing of these certainly tails off after the first three books, but Dune always must be included in any best of science fiction list.</p>
 <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you’re finished with this saga, and looking for something in the same thread, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try one of these on</a> for size.</p> <h2 id="h-2-the-foundation-series-isaac-asimov" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/3BB14Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#2 The Foundation Series – Isaac Asimov </span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Isaac Asimov is widely regarded to be one of the granddaddies of science fiction, and rightfully so. Many will know the film I, Robot, starring Will Smith. This is loosely based on the book of the same name from <a href="https://geni.us/3BB14Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">the Foundation Series</a> produced by Isaac Asimov.</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">If you want to dig into some of the earliest science fiction novels ever written and witness phenomenal world-building, prediction, and galaxy-spanning writing, I cannot recommend the Foundation series highly enough. Beyond the wonderful storytelling, the cultural significance and genre-defining work these books hold cannot be ignored. </p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">There are seven books in the saga, but three core ones. Due to their vast reach, reading them all in order isn’t essential. The books cover many theories both in technology and psychology of the time, capturing the paranoias and fascination of the 1950s. </p> <h2 id="h-1-the-culture-novels-iain-m-banks" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/pB4hJgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#1 The Culture Novels – Iain M Banks</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned at the beginning of this piece, of course, any ‘best of’ science fiction list is going to be heavily subjective. <a href="https://geni.us/pB4hJgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Culture Novels</a> by Iain M Banks are, for me, where I have found the most joy in any science fiction writing. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The universe Banks creates with his many varied and creative worlds never fails to pull me in. The books in his science fiction saga can really be read in any order, with some crossover in characters and planets. Each book is a standalone tale captured within the Culture universe.</p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">These novels take place in a future utopia, with everything living in a post-scarcity society. The AI of the planet-sized ships is beyond our understanding of intelligence but entirely benevolent, seeing humanity as a sweet pet rather than a threat. Humans live how they choose, deciding on the paths they want to take, aided by the ships.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">This doesn’t mean the universe of The Culture Novels isn’t without its drama. Many incredible and beautifully crafted narratives are pulled from this world. Rather than creating stories from struggle and conflict, Banks chooses to take the path of resistance and arm humanity to the hilt but still create adventure and struggle.</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The Culture Series has, for me, some of the most interesting concepts and beautiful writing in Science Fiction sagas. The many varied books that have come from it are each incredibly individual, with each one digging into a new concept or conflict. Pick any one of these up, and you’ll immediately understand why.</p>

            <p>Sorry, Helldivers, but no – Arrowhead has no plans to introduce a story mode for Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>Responding to a commenter on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, newly-appointed CEO Shams Jorjani confirmed a story mode was "not happening".</p>

<p>When asked if the team could "create a story mode for co-op [...] with epic moments and tragic scenes," Jorjani replied briefly but candidly.</p>
<p>"Not happening. Sorry bro," Jorjani said. "That's like building an entirely new game."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not happening. Sorry bro. That's like building an entirely new game.</p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801312333379084727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As for what's next for the viral shooter? Jorjani confirmed that first the team is set to take a well-earned summer break – it may have a <a href="https://x.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801342513103487286">"small impact"</a> on things in the immediate term – but after that, the studio will "try to stick" to the cadence of updates and patches releases we've seen recently.</p>
<p>"[That's] the intent, at least," Jorjani said.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 may be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers have declined</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 24 hours is 80,038, although that only accounts for Steam players, of course.</p>
<p>The most notable explanation as why this has happened could be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="498" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">On May 24, 2024, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/">the controversial third season of <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5</a> launched, thrusting players into a frenzied and chaotic map. A portion of it has been overtaken by a desolate post-apocalyptic wasteland occupied by sparse thrown-together structures. Players don’t want to be caught traversing it on foot, either, seeing as massive weapon-equipped vehicles of all varieties roam the landscape. It’s all very much <em>Mad Max-inspired</em>, and yet, there’s no <em>Mad Max</em> tie-in to be seen.</p> <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The very same day <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3 kicked off, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> released in theaters. After ages of development, the story of Mad Max: Fury Road’s favorite Imperator Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) was told on the big screen. Thus, it seemed like an opportune time to add some Mad Max franchise skins to the item shop, or even as part of the Battle Pass. Instead, for whatever reason, <em>Fallout</em> skins were added to the game. While these aren’t totally inappropriate for the dystopian setting, they don’t quite mesh with the nitro-fueled mayhem the season has to offer.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Though no concrete reason for the lack of <em>Mad Max</em> skins has come to light, it stands to reason there was some kind of licensing issue that prevented their inclusion. In the event such troubles are remedied before the season ends, however, <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3 could use, at the very least, these five of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/">the many weird and wild <em>Mad Max </em>universe characters</a>.</p>  <figure data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-nux-mad-max-fury-road" data-injectable="false">5. Nux (Mad Max: Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Along with a host of other villains, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> introduces the War Boys to the <em>Mad Max</em> mythology. They’re a fanatical lot who serve the Citadel with pride, fiercely protecting its leadership without question. Among them is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who goes from a deeply committed War Boy to a hero of the Wasteland, ultimately giving his life to help the likes of Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) defeat Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne/Lachy Hulme) and his forces.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Nux would be an excellent addition to the latest <em>Fortnite</em> season. He has a unique look and is one of the most energetic characters in <em>Fury Road</em>, hence why he’s so fondly remembered almost a decade after the film’s release. Not to mention, his car, the Chevrolet 5 Window Coupe 1934, would be a blast to drive around in. An exclusive emote featuring him spraying his teeth with chrome spray paint, a War Boys tradition in battle, would be the cherry on top.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-dementus-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga" data-injectable="false">4. Dementus (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="842" data-injectable="true">Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) makes his<em> Mad Max</em> franchise debut in <em>Furiosa</em>, and he’s quite a unique entity in a world full of them. The leader of the Biker Horde, he takes Furiosa in at the start of the film, only for them to drift apart in short order. As they clash and he gives up on her ever seeing him as her adoptive father, Dementus becomes increasingly manipulated by the Wasteland. By the film’s end, he’s nothing short of a charismatic yet violent warlord, ultimately killed by Furiosa after being defeated in battle.</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Though he’s a new addition to the <em>Mad Max</em> film canon, Dementus is more than worthy of a <em>Fortnite</em> skin. He has several costume changes throughout Furiosa that could justify alternate looks, his motorcycle chariot would be awesome to drive around the map, and, overall, his inclusion would be some nice (albeit a bit late) promotion for <em>Furiosa</em>. Besides, the character is just Chris Hemsworth running around in crazy costumes acting like a wild man. Who wouldn’t want to drop a few V-bucks on that?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-immortan-joe-mad-max-fury-road-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga" data-injectable="false">3. Immortan Joe (Mad Max: Fury Road/Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="862" data-injectable="true">Dementus may be a threatening enemy, but he pales in comparison to Immortan Joe. The leader of the Citadel and the Cult of the V8, he uses the water supply of his fortress to control those below him. Despite the fact that he’s falling apart at the seams due to age and poor health, his followers are entirely devoted to him and see him as a god, and he’s more than willing to exploit them for his own gain. To put it simply, he’s a tyrant, hence why it’s so cathartic when Furiosa brutally takes his life at the end of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">With his pale white skin and hair, piercing eyes, intricate armor, and grimacing breathing mask, Joe is tailor-made for a <em>Fortnite</em> skin and would be so cool to see in the Wasteland. His signature vehicle, The Gigahorse, which is comprised of two 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Villes along with a host of custom-made attachments, would be a force to be reckoned with on the road, too. The Megalo Don skin evokes some of the main design elements seen on Joe, but having the real deal would be so much better.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-imperator-furiosa-mad-max-fury-road-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga" data-injectable="false">2. Imperator Furiosa (Mad Max: Fury Road/Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="true">Since her franchise introduction in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Furiosa has risen to become one of the most popular characters in the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise. As if that film doesn’t drive home just how tough-as-nails, cool, and capable she is, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> makes that point abundantly clear. She goes from an abducted child to a full-on warrior, exacting revenge on Dementus for killing her mother and attempting to forcer her into a life of servitude to Immortan Joe.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">Not only does Furiosa’s overall badassery make her a perfect fit for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3, but so do her many looks throughout her two movie appearances. She could come with a range of different alternate attires. Long hair, short hair, face paint, no face paint, arm, no arm, the list goes on. The Tatra T815, better known as the War Rig, would be an awesome addition as well and make for solid opposition against the season’s hulking War Bus.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-max-rockatansky" data-injectable="false">1. Max Rockatansky</h2> <p data-characters="553" data-current-count="853" data-injectable="true">If there could only be one <em>Mad Max</em> skin added to <em>Fortnite</em>, then there’s no denying that it should be Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson, Tom Hardy) himself. The character has anchored the franchise since its beginning in 1979, braving all the perils that the Wasteland has to offer, defeating evil in various forms, helping those in need, and coming out the other side just fine. He’s a big screen legend and has jumped to other forms of media like comics and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/">video games</a>, which is to say that his appearance in <em>Fortnite</em> would be entirely on brand.</p>
 <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="false">Of course, the big question is, should the Gibson or Hardy version of the character be the one to soar from the Battle Bus? All things considered, both are viable picks. With three movies behind him, Gibson’s Max comes with a few costumes to choose from. On the other hand, what Hardy’s Max lacks in outfits he makes up for in relevance, as his interpretation is far newer and likely more recognizable to most <em>Fortnite</em> players. Between the two, there are several unique vehicle options, too, completing the Max ensemble.</p>
