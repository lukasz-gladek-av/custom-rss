The new 8BitDo Ultimate 2 features a similar asymmetrical stick layout to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/30/23326887/8bitdo-ultimate-pro-controller-bluetooth-preorder-nintendo-switch-wireless">8BitDo’s original Ultimate controller that launched in 2022</a>, but adds additional buttons, interactive LED lighting, and tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) joysticks that are even more durable than Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p>We still don’t know if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">Nintendo will switch to Hall effect joysticks</a> for the Switch 2, but companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">GuliKit have already moved away from them</a> in favor of TMR. The technology has already long been used in hard drives to boost storage capacities. For controllers, it allows for joysticks that draw less power, which can improve battery life while nearly eliminating the risk of joystick drift that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">plagued the Nintendo Switch</a> and other modern controllers before magnetic Hall effect technology was adopted.</p><p>8BitDo is also bringing over the RGB Fire Ring lighting effects first introduced on its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325092/8bitdo-ultimate-mini-wired-microsoft-xbox-controller-rgb-lighting">smaller-sized Ultimate C wired Xbox controller</a>. As the branding implies, both joysticks feature a ring of color-changing LEDs around their base with several lighting modes that react to button presses (including the triggers) or the direction the joysticks are being pushed.</p><p>The Ultimate 2’s triggers still use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and reliability, but 8BitDo has introduced a switch that lets you swap their behavior between longer draw triggers ideal for racing games and short pull tactile triggers for quicker responses while playing first-person shooters. And like the budget-minded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2c</a>, the Ultimate 2 has an extra pair of customizable shoulder buttons on the back.</p><p>The controller connects to 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2, which is also available as a mobile app, allowing buttons to be remapped and the sensitivity of joysticks and triggers to be adjusted. The controller has support for motion controls for games that support it, and a charging dock is still included.</p><p>Connectivity options include Bluetooth, a wired USB-C connection, or a low-lag 2.4GHz wireless connection using an included USB-C dongle. But like the cheaper Ultimate 2C, 8BitDo has only made its new Ultimate 2 controller compatible with PCs running Windows 10 and later or Android devices running Android 9.0 and newer.</p><p>Versions of the new Ultimate 2 compatible with the Xbox, iOS, or Nintendo Switch (and presumably the Switch 2) haven’t been announced yet, but 8BitDo previously released <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/">additional versions of the original Ultimate controller</a> with alternate compatibility.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ensemble, led by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-grammy-award-8-bit-big-band-meta-knights-revenge-1848745709">Grammy-winning 8-Bit Big Band director Charlie Rosen</a></span>, performed never-before-heard rock arrangements of music most people had only heard as chiptune tracks backing up a shovel-swinging hero’s adventure. And yet, there are only two planned performances of these arrangements by this group of musicians. The setlist included selections from the base <em>Shovel Knight </em>game, as well as the DLC campaigns developer Yacht Club Games released. When the show reached its final number, Rosen—in defiance of the posted notices to the contrary—asked the audience to record the rest of the performance, lest the entire show become nothing but a memory for the few hundred fans in the audience. If you were wondering why the only footage from the performance seems to be of the <em>Shovel Knight</em> end credits theme, that’s probably why.</p><p>As a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/shovel-knight-live-steel-thy-shovel-concert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-show concert series</a></span> with performances only happening in New York and L.A., the potential audience for Shovel Knight Live is limited to people who already live in those cities, and those sickest of <em>Shovel Knight</em> sickos willing to invest the time and money into travelling there for one night. So as wonderful as it is to hear talented musicians reimagining these iconic tracks for a live show, it’s sad only a fraction of <em>Shovel Knight </em>fans will ever hear them.</p><p>And my god, what a show it was. Live performances have a way of making you appreciate aspects of a piece’s composition that you might not even process when listening to it on your headphones, or when it’s playing in the background as you whack people with a shovel in <em>Shovel Knight</em>. Rosen and crew’s rearrangements of composer Jake Kaufman’s original score were incredible reimaginings with guitar, horns, and strings that had me and the rest of the audience popping off in the Town Hall. Hearing a violin soar over the rest of the band had me welling up in my seat. It took me back to playing <em>Shovel Knight </em>on my PlayStation Vita in 2015. The grand sense of adventure and stress I felt when playing some of the more challenging levels flowed back into me after having not played the game in a decade, all punctuated by footage of the game playing in the background of each song.</p><p>Even though I hadn’t played <em>Shovel Knight </em>in years, I couldn’t help but get caught up in the passion in the room. In a previous life, I was studying to be a music teacher before I pivoted into journalism, and I’ve only recently gotten back to music as a hobby. Some of my defining musical projects when I was a semi-professional musician involved rearranging songs so my local choirs could perform them, so I know that breaking a piece of music you love and putting it back together as something else is the kind of thing you only do if you’re passionate about the source material.</p><p>Earlier this year I went to see the <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>orchestra concert, which was an incredible show full of talented musicians, but those were more or less one-to-one recreations of the tracks you’ll hear in the RPG. Maybe it’s the hibernating composer in me hyperfixating on the little details of how a violin or horn section was able to create something new and exciting out of chiptune music, but seeing a group of incredible performers playing <em>Shovel Knight</em>’s music in ways it never had been before elevated the show beyond what might, on paper, just look like an event for diehard fans. It was an exceptional showcase of musical talent and passion of a sort that only a live show can truly communicate. I hope that these first two shows are successful enough that Yacht Club Games gives more people the chance to experience this performance. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis are finally giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> a burglar of its own in a new update that's live on all platforms. The Sims 4's burglar update coincides with the launch of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-businesses-hobbies-expansion-adds-tattoo-artist-career-and-ceramic-incense-burners/1100-6529300/" data-ref-id="1100-6529300">Businesses and Hobbies expansion</a>, though you don't have to buy the new pack to get the burglar. It's a free update for the base game with special interactions if you own certain other expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Maxis included a burglar in The Sims, The Sims 2, and The Sims 3, but never in The Sims 4 until now. Robin Banks, the new version of the criminal mastermind, behaves in much the same way as the burglar in previous iterations. There's a low chance that Robin will enter your residential or business lot at night, and she can potentially make off with anything inside that isn't attached to the structure, such as windows or lights, or that isn't planted in the ground, like your shrubbery. The update also adds a new lot challenge, Heist Havoc, that increases the likelihood of Robin appearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims might wake up, catch Robin, and call the police before she makes off with their property, though there's no guarantee the police will arrive before Robin makes her getaway. Maxis said the only sure way to stop a burglar is to install an alarm, which alerts police as soon as Robin enters the premises. Sims who are good with their hands can upgrade their alarm to keep it from breaking as frequently or even modify it to release an electric charge and stun the burglar. If your Sim is more physically inclined, they can also pick a fight with Robin, though they might lose if they aren't in good shape.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wnGkiBOtM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_wnGkiBOtM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of other Sims 4 expansions include unique interactions for the burglar. For example, if you own the Cats and Dogs pack and have a dog in your house, they might chase Robin out. Vampire Sims can turn Robin into a thrall and command her to leave, while scientists from the Get to Work pack can use a freeze ray to stop Robin. Non-playable Sims, such as Agnes Crumplebottom in the Cottage Living pack, will have their own methods for dealing with Robin.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Maxis said The Sims 4 treats Robin like other special NPCs. You can make friends with her and add her to your household, and if she moves in with you or dies, another, generic burglar will spawn and take up her criminal mantle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Games has shut down three studios, including Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego. This follows the reports that the Wonder Woman game (which is now canceled) <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was in development trouble</a>, not to mention the failure of MultiVersus, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down soon</a>.</p>
<p>Monolith Productions is by far the most storied developer out of all three. Founded in 1994, the studio released games like Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, No One Lives Forever, Tron 2.0, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War games. The latter was the last game they released back in October 2017. At The Game Awards 2021, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a Wonder Woman game featuring an original story and the studio's trademarked Nemesis system seen in the Middle-earth games. However, as mentioned in the aforementioned report, after all these years, the development was still nowhere near ready, and Warner Bros. Games (which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced division chief David Haddad</a>) must have decided to cut its losses instead.</p>
<p>The publisher has released the following statement to comment on the news:</p>
<p><em>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises — Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately, this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. </em></p>
<p><em>This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith's storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</em></p>
<p>Even the outstanding success of Hogwarts Legacy, the best-selling game in 2023, was not enough to offset several disappointing releases for the publisher, including Gotham Knights, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus, and now Wonder Woman. It didn't help that all the studios at Warner Bros. Games, except for NetherRealm and Avalanche Software, seemingly took between six and seven years to release a new game, far longer than the average triple-A title.</p>
<p>It's yet another hard blow to an industry that is facing continuous rounds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio closures</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invincible-ttrpg-by-free-league-brings-superhero-action-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League and Skybound Interactive are working on an official <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG. Several industry veterans will design this tabletop adaptation of the superhero property created by Robert Kirkman, including a producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Invincible</em> TTRPG will be coming to Kickstarter later this year. The game's initial release will include a Core Rulebook containing everything needed to play and a beginner-friendly Starter Set. Both books will be illustrated by original comic artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley with graphic design by Johan Nohr.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invincible-ttrpg-book-cover.jpg?itok=UjNqeNsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invincible-ttrpg-book-cover.jpg?itok=lcEZqEfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The names attached are noteworthy for who is designing this RPG. The lead designers include Adam Bradford, the founder of the virtual tabletop platform D&amp;D Beyond. Bradford has also produced for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Cortex Prime</em>, and <em>Marvel</em>. The second designer is Free League co-founder Tomas Harenstam, whose design credits include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-alien-tabletop-rpg-hits-shelves-this-december" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Alien RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, and <em>Dragonbane</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One of my very first tabletop roleplaying games was the old Marvel Superheroes by TSR, and making a superhero RPG has been a lifelong dream. I think the genre, and Invincible’s more grounded and visceral take on it, is a great fit for the Year Zero Engine game mechanics,” says Tomas Härenstam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notably, the press release doesn't state what RPG system the <em>Invincible TTRPG</em> will use. Given Free League's history, there's a chance it will use a modified version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-year-zero-engine-ogl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Year Zero Engine</a>, the same one used for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Coriolis</em></a> and<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-ttrpg-shambles-to-tables-fall-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em> The Walking Dead RPG</em></a>. Given the system's versatility, it is not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Invincible was a comic series created by Robert Kirkman in 2003. It heralded the end of the Dark Age of comic books thanks to its well-written and complex characters, mature but heroic storylines, and a complex superhero world unburdened by decades of history or the messy storytelling baggage of retcons told over 144 issues.</p>

<p>The series has recently been adapted into an animated series on Prime Video. This series recently aired its third season.</p>

As reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring?embedded-checkout=true">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company’s gaming division is canceling the <em>Wonder Woman</em> game announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827161/wonder-woman-game-warner-bros-monolith-productions-the-game-awards">in 2021</a> and shutting down three studios: <em>Wonder Woman</em> developer Monolith Productions, <em>MultiVersus</em> developer Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego.</p><p>WBD confirmed the changes in a statement to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24"><em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach</a>. “We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises — <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, DC and <em>Game of Thrones</em>,” according to the statement. “After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.”</p><p>As for why <em>Wonder Woman</em> is being canceled, “our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities,” the statement says. “This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games.”</p><p>Warner Bros. Discovery says in the statement that it remains “focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.”</p><p>The cancellation and shutdowns are yet another rough spot in Warner Bros.’ gaming efforts. Player First Games recently announced that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24097129/multiversus-release-date-warner-bros-games"><em>MultiVersus</em> will be taken offline</a>, ending a development period that has already included a long hiatus and a relaunch. <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> was a flop, with that game receiving its last season <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">less than a year after launch</a>. A previous report from <em>Bloomberg</em> said that WB’s gaming division <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/608375/warner-bros-games-has-burned-a-300-million-hole">suffered $300 million in losses last year</a>.</p><p>2023’s <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> has been a success for WB, and the company is reportedly working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/">a definitive edition for the game</a> with more content.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lizk5skwps2d?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jason Schrier on BlueSky">report from Jason Schreier</a>, shared that the latest studios to be cut are: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p>

<p>As part of the closure of Monolith Productions, the Wonder Woman game that they were working on is also being cancelled. The game was expected to make use of their signature Nemesis System that premiered back in <em>Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor</em>. As of last known count, over 170 people worked at Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>This follows the stepping down of WB Games head <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros. Games Head David Haddad to Step Down After 12 Years">David Haddad last month</a> after 12 years on the job. It marks a decrease in WB Games' lineup following the failure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, <em>Harry Potter Quidd itch Champions</em>, and struggles with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/multiversus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Multiversus"><em>Multiversus</em> </a>(which was worked on by Player First Games and WB San Diego).

<p>The remaining studios that are part of WB Games are:</p>

<ul><li>Rocksteady (who worked on<em> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and previously made the <em>Arkham</em> games).</li>
	<li>WB Montreal (<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>),</li>
	<li>TT Games (Lego games),</li>
	<li>NetherRealm (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em>),</li>
	<li>WB Games offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.</li>

This is also part of WB Discovery's pattern of massive cuts under CEO <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros.

The TV executive has said that these cuts took "courage" to make.</p>

<p>For now we're left pondering the works that came in the past, such as the masterful <em>Shadows of Mordor</em> from Monolith Productions, or the missed potential of <em>Multiversus</em>.</p>

My colleague Antonio has seen in his time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335012/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-amd-ryzen-max-plus-price-specs">with the Asus Z13 gaming tablet</a> that Strix Halo is roughly around the performance of an Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile chip. AMD gaming architect boss Frank Azor was also here with some 1080p benchmarks at high settings; it apparently can’t quite play the most demanding games (like <em>Black Myth Wukong </em>and <em>Starfield</em>) at over 60fps at native resolution with everything turned up, but the claim is that even 1440p at 60fps is possible with AMD’s FSR upscaling.</p><p>Even if you’re not getting your money’s worth out of AI, though, the prices on these desktops don’t seem all that outlandish. While a desktop with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, 80MB of cache of the 395 Plus chip, and 128GB of memory will cost $1,999 — not including bring-your-own storage and OS — you can pick one with 8 CPU cores, 32 graphics cores, 40MB of cache and 32GB of memory for $1,099. There’s also a 395 Plus with just 64GB of RAM for $1,599. Or, you can buy a mainboard alone for $799 if you provide your own mini-ITX case and power supply, too.</p><p>If you are looking for the most powerful mini-PC, Patel suggested the $1,999 model compares favorably to an Apple Mac Studio, which can cost over twice as much for the same 128GB of RAM.</p><div><p>Framework says these desktops and mainboard should be available to preorder today, with plans to ship in Q3. If you’re reading these words shortly after they were published, I’m currently at a Framework event in San Francisco, where the company also just introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/618769">new AMD-powered version of its Framework Laptop 13</a> and the new Framework Laptop 12: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618784/framework-laptop-12-touchscreen-convertible-announcement-release-date">its first budget laptop, its first touchscreen, and its first convertible. </a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But when Vicarious Visions got absorbed, the publisher sought other developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth of it is that [Activision] were trying to find somebody to do 3 + 4 but they just didn’t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,” Tony Hawk said in a Twitch livestream in 2022. “Like, ‘What would you do with the THPS title?’ And they didn’t like anything they heard, and then that was it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question remains, then: if a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remake is happening, and it sure looks like it is, who's making it? The Singaporean ratings board only lists Activision as the publisher and developer.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stars-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-634584">Stars Reach</a>, a new sci-fi MMO seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsreach/stars-reach/description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a>, has blown past its initial funding goal of $200,000 in less than an hour of being live.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt the pedigree behind Stars Reach is part of the reason for that. The game is coming from studio Playable Worlds, led by Raph Koster, one of the lead creators of MMO classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ultima-online/" data-ref-id="5000-2222">Ultima Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-galaxies-the-complete-online-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-27644">Star Wars Galaxies</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRd5xiNfCg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZRd5xiNfCg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Stars Reach is putting a heavy emphasis on its sandbox nature, giving players the freedom to shape its galaxy how they see fit. That means it's up to players to terraform planets, build settlements, form trade empires, genetically engineer alien creatures, or wipe entire planets off the map. The game's universe is procedurally generated, and players will have the ability to shape it to their liking.</p><p dir="ltr">It all sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, albeit with far more players. There will be spaceships and action-based combat, but much like the more free-form Star Wars Galaxies from which Stars Reach is taking heavy inspiration, combat doesn't sound like the game's focus. There will be dozens of professions to choose from, some ideal for combat, but many that aren't. Its "endgame" sounds like it's whatever players want it to be, whether it be governing a city or exploring the deep reaches of space. It certainly sounds ambitious, with cities and even a planet's ecosystem all falling on the shoulders of players to manage.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike some Kickstarter games that seek funding on little more than concept art and a dream, Stars Reach is said to already be fairly far along, having been in development for several years at this point. There have been playable pre-alpha tests for months now, with the goal being for Stars Reach to launch in early access this summer. A full release is tentatively slated to come in the first half of next year. As stated on the Kickstarter page, seeking public funding "isn't about starting the game--it's about finishing it, expanding it, and bringing this living galaxy to its full potential."</p><p dir="ltr">Those who want to play during early access will need to support the Kickstarter at the $30 tier or purchase an early access supporter pack when those become available. The full game, however, will be free-to-play with optional microtransactions. Like many free-to-play MMOs, there will be an optional monthly subscription as well, though this one will be required for those looking to build homes on the intergalactic frontier. It's called the Property Pass, and along with letting players become landowners, it will also grant access to unique cosmetics and other items.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first Kickstarter update after surpassing its initial goal, Playable Worlds said it was humbled and grateful for the support.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is your victory as much as ours, and we can't wait to take this journey together," Playable Worlds' statement reads. "But the journey isn't over. The more we raise the faster we can bring this game to market. And the better the game will be."</p>

            <p>
Following recent claims Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game was in trouble and still "years away from release", the company has reportedly now cancelled the project and shut down its developer Monolith Productions as part of a string of studio closures.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d">made the claim in a post shared on BlueSky</a>. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego, sources tell Bloomberg News," Schreier wrote. "Warner Bros. is also canceling the Wonder Woman game."
</p>
<p>
Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">first suggested Wonder Woman was in trouble earlier this month</a>, as part of a report detailing the culture of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president David Haddad</a> - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision".

<p>
At the time, Schreier claimed Wonder Woman had "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year. All that upheaval was reported to have cost Warner Bros. $100m, with sources telling Bloomberg its future remained "in question".
</p>
<p>
Wonder Woman's reported cancellation comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros.'s games division, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. 
</p>
<p>
We've reached out to Warner Bros. for comment on these latest reports and will update the story as more comes in.

<p>Warner Bros. Games has canceled its Wonder Woman game and shut down multiple studios. Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier broke the news on Tuesday afternoon that, in addition to the game, Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego are all being closed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring?srnd=undefined&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Schreier</a> states that the cuts “reflect a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refocusing of the games division</a> on major franchises such as Harry Potter,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>&nbsp;and DC Comics, primarily Batman.”</p>



<p>In an internal memo obtained by Schreier, Warner Bros.  head of games and streaming JB Perrette said that “too many” recent releases have “really missed the mark”.</p>



<p>“We need to make some substantial changes to our portfolio/team structure if we are to commit the necessary resources to get back to a ‘fewer but bigger franchises’ strategy,” he said.</p>



<p>In addition, Warner Bros. Games gave a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>. Insider Gaming also received the same statement. Rather than cut it up, you can read it in full below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.</em></p>



<p><em>The development of Monolith’s Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions.</em></p>



<p><em>As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wonder Woman was first announced at The Game Awards 2021, and was being developed by Monolith Productions. The game was set to feature the Nemesis system made popular by its Middle-earth games. Since its reveal announcement, news surrounding Wonder Woman had been scarce with it reported that the game had been completely rebooted sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>Monolith was formed in 1994 before becoming a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Games in 2004.</p>



<p>The closing of Player First Games comes after its debut game MultiVersus was canceled with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutdown happening in May</a>. Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired the studio</a> in July 2024. Lastly, WB San Diego was founded in 2019 and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-opens-new-mobile-studio-in-san-diego" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">focused primarily</a> on mobile and free-to-play games.</p>



<p>The news of the cancelation and closures also comes just weeks after it was announced that current Warner Bros. Interactive president David Haddad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-david-haddad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was leaving the company</a> this spring. His departure comes after 12 years in his division.</p>



<p>As of writing, there’s been no public statement from Warner Bros. Games. It’s also unclear if anyone from the closing studios will be moved, or if everyone will be let go. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-steam-next-fest-demo-impressions-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m floating in space, clinging to the hull of a spaceship. I peer in through a trash chute – not the most glamorous window into the ship’s vacuum-sealed world, but it will have to do. Inside, a lone guard patrols around a laundry room. Perfect, she’ll make for an easy ambush. I wait for her to turn her back, and then I burst in. Immediately, everything goes awry. Because I entered through the trash chute, I’m now stinky, and the guard snaps to attention as soon as she catches a whiff. I frantically scurry under a counter, where I happen upon a hidden stash of soap. Fantastic. I can work with this.&nbsp;</p><p>I throw a couple bars onto the ground, producing sudsy bubbles and causing the guard to slip and fall. I rush out to finish her off, only to… also faceplant as a result of my self-made slip ‘n’ slide. The guard opens fire, and I roll into a nearby vent with just a sliver of health left. OK, I think, this isn’t going <em>great</em>, but I still have options. As I linger in the vent, a meter fills telling me that I will soon sneeze – not great for stealth – but that gives me an idea. Earlier I picked up a container full of black pepper; I barge back into the laundry room, take aim, and throw it at the guard, who begins sneezing and wheezing. It’s now or never. I leap onto her back and wrestle her onto one washing machine, followed by another. That leaves her down for the count. Then, of course, I pop her head off nice and clean and throw it out the airlock. You know, so she can’t levitate over to a new body. Another job well done.</p><p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skin Deep</em></a> in a nutshell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Skin Deep - Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rP1matuR3qQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Skin Deep</em> first appeared on my radar almost as soon as it was announced several years ago, largely because I’ve been a fan of developer Blendo Games since the hazily-remembered days of <em>Gravity Bone</em> and <em>Thirty Flights Of Loving</em>, games that told tight, absurd stories with a uniquely cinematic flair for the dramatic. But on other occasions, such as 2016’s <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, the studio revealed its true passion: densely-packed mechanical systems, the kind that fit together like gears in a pocketwatch. <em>Skin Deep</em>, which comes out in April, applies pretty much every tool in Blendo’s belt to a sci-fi immersive sim. It makes a phenomenal first impression.</p><p><em>Skin Deep</em>, a brief demo of which is now available as part of Steam Next Fest, describes itself as an “immersive first-person shooter” in which you play as an insurance operative who rescues talking cats. (When you do so, by the way, they explode out of their tiny jail cells, and the word “MEOW” flies across the screen.) You’re outnumbered and outgunned aboard nonlinear spaceships, with standout features that include the aforementioned sneezing tendency, as well as the fact that your character is constantly barefoot for some reason.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>The setup might sound silly, but it works. For example, if you step on broken glass, it gets lodged in your foot. Yikes. But if you yank it out, you can both recover some health and gain a new weapon. This kind of thinking suffuses the whole experience: Even the most mundane objects can be potent offensive tools in the right hands (or feet). I’m talking books, hunks of metal, walkie talkies, tuna cans, and slapstick classics like banana peels and fishbones. Creativity is your paintbrush. Every level is a canvas.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I’ve replayed the second level several times, with a devious glee that takes me back to childhood afternoons spent with the <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> demo that came bundled with <em>Zone of the Enders</em>. There are just so many ways to mess with these three hapless guards, and they’re all funny. Certainly, I’ll always remember my nearly-botched first attempt, but my second go ‘round – when I realized I could use books and coffee cups to shatter numerous windows and turn most of the ship into an antigravity playground – represented a true turning of the tables, a new power dynamic born of ingenuity (and my character’s thus-far-unexplained ability to breathe in outer space).</p><figure><figcaption>Blendo Games</figcaption></figure><p>After only an hour or so, which includes replays, I’m extremely high on <em>Skin Deep</em>. It feels like one of those games that’s going to keep throwing comically ingenious (or perhaps ingeniously comical) curveballs at me as levels increase in complexity, and whatever comes next will be positioned atop a uniquely confident foundation. As it stands, games already have plenty of slick infiltrations and assassinations. They need more knock-down, drag-out cartoon brawls. They need more slapstick. <em>Skin Deep</em>’s demo gets it. I sure hope the full game does too.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down"><h3>Fuck WB</h3></a><p>Another all-time great studio sacrificed at the altar of Line Go Up</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/a-manga-about-transforming-into-a-plant-for-the-greater-good"><h3>A Manga About Transforming Into A Plant For The Greater Good</h3></a><p>Fool Night asks if humanity can enrich their hearts in eternal darkness</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop.1118730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/framework-known-for-upgradable-laptops-intros-not-particularly-upgradable-desktop/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599.&nbsp;If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny. </p>

<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. "If the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second" is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much&nbsp;<em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>

Games said it made the "very difficult" decision to restructure its development teams, resulting in these studio closures. Going forward, Warner Bros. Games said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p><p>The statement said the decision to close the three studios was a "strategic change" that had nothing to do with the teams or the talented individuals working there.</p><p>As for the new Wonder Woman game, Warner Bros. said it wanted to make "the highest quality" game, but "unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." Wonder Woman is, of course, a DC property, but it seemingly is not a fit within the company's new strategy.</p><p>"This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith's storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games," the company said.</p><p>WBD gaming boss JB Perrette announced these decisions in a memo to staff today obtained by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. He said some staff who were not laid off will be reassigned to other internal roles where possible. He also said Warner Bros. will look to do more in the mobile games space and aims to "regain our credibility and swagger at producing great games." Perrette also reflected on some of the company's recent misses in gaming, saying the "product-market fit and quality of too many of our new releases has really missed the mark."</p><p>He added: "We need to and will do better for our fans first and foremost, and also because regaining that credibility is critical to us securing even more investment in games in the years to come."</p><p>A recent report said the new Wonder Woman game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">had already cost Warner Bros. more than $100 million and was nowhere close to being ready for release.</a> This follows a trend at Warner Bros.
