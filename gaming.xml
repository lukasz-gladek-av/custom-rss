            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/tmnt-tactical-takedown-review-impressions-steam-tactics-1851782184<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> isn’t like most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972">other <em>TMNT</em> games</a></span>. Usually, in games featuring the famous turtle crimefighters, you punch and kick a ton of goons in real-time, either alone or with some buddies. That’s not the case in <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown,</em> which is instead a turn-based tactics game. Thankfully, the shift to turn-based mostly works for the Turtles, even if the game is a bit barebones. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,196394,196599" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em>, battles play out on small maps covered in grids. Each mission features one turtle fighting his way through these maps turn-by-turn, while enemies spawn throughout, also moving on their own turns across the grid. Your goal is often to clear out the baddies while reaching the end of the level. </p><p>At first, I was worried that this tactical and slower-paced turn-based gameplay wouldn’t feel <em>TMNT</em>-enough, that it would lack the kinetic excitement of most of the <em>Ninja Turtle</em> games and shows. But, developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903">Strange Scaffold</a></span> (of <em>Witch Stranding</em>, <em>E</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>l, Paso Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em> fame) did a great job infusing the strategic gameplay with flourishes and ideas that make it feel plenty exciting and fast-paced. </p><p>One significant way <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> makes the action feel exciting is ensuring that you don’t hang out in one area during missions. Instead, you are pushed forward every few turns as the levels grow ahead of you and fall behind you. For example, during one mission, I entered some subway trains and as the train started, the grid outside of the train turned red—a visual warning it was about to vanish—disappearing along with some goons. Then, once the train reached its station, and I had beaten up another dozen or so Foot Clan members, I exited before the carriage itself fell into the void, taking more baddies with it.</p><p> Having levels change every few turns means I had to keep moving forward, similar to an old-school beat ‘em up. And you can even take advantage of the levels changing by kicking back enemies into the red areas and watching them fall into nothing on your next turn. However, it’s even more fun to kick them off the edge of the maps, something I did a lot<em>. </em></p><p>Another design choice I appreciated is that most of the Turtles’ moves encourage you to be aggressive, and then reward it. A lot of times in <em>Tactical Takedown,</em> I was taking out multiple enemies in one turn by chaining attacks in satisfying ways, although given this also means the game is designed around you defeating tons of enemies quickly, it leads to some missions quickly filling up with Foot Clan soldiers who can too often overwhelm your Turtles if you make a mistake. I wonder if, for those hoping for a more arcade-like experience, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> might prove too tactically challenging. </p><p>Of course, any <em>TMNT </em>game is going to star the Turtles themselves, and this is easily the best part of the <em>Tactical Takedown.</em> The Turtles are separated for the entire game, mostly, and that’s a bit strange—sure, if you do enough cool shit you can pull off a team up move—but most of the time you are playing as each turtle separately. </p><figure id="" data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Strange Scaffold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while they don’t fight side by side throughout most of the game, they do talk to each other via cutscenes, and the writing here is excellent. I won’t spoil too much, but the conflict between the brothers is the core of the tale, and it’s shocking how invested I got in the rather simple, but well-delivered story of four mutated turtle warriors dealing with grief, loss, and trying to pick up the pieces together.</p><p>Sadly, too much of<em> TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> feels barebones. Levels look fine, but are very simple, rarely featuring varying locations or details. The Turtles all play differently, with various moves that reflect their personality, but so many sound effects are reused. Couple that with simplistic, stiff combat animations and levels that go on for too long, and <em>Tactical Takedown</em> can often feel like a game that is trying to trick you into thinking it’s more than it is.</p><p>Still, I’m happy <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> was made, and that I played it. It’s a unique spin on the franchise, and the turn-based combat is frenetic and fun. I also love the way the Turtles are depicted in cutscenes. It’s a shame that there’s not much else here, but what is there is good and feels like a solid foundation for future DLC or sequels that could add more. </p><p> <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>launched on May 22 for PC. It is available now on Steam and runs great on Steam Deck. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the duos out there though, it sounds like you'll need to be open to a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</a>, the Nightreign lead discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives. Who knows? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">You might match up with someone pretty good at the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing solo, it does sound like Elden Ring Nightreign takes that into account. Ishizaki said the parameters of Elden Ring Nightreign "adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session," so lone wolves shouldn't be too overwhelmed in single-player.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll have to find and locate some self-revive options, which are incorporated for those opting for single-player. And if you're playing trios, well, that's apparently what Elden Ring Nightreign is built around. Whether duos support shows up or not, having an extra hand around can't hurt against some of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">the fearsome bosses</a> waiting in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is out on May 30, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Read on to learn everything we know so far about Project 007, including plans for it to potentially kick off a new trilogy.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_platforms">Project 007 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</a></li><li><a href="#A_James_Bond_shakeup">A James Bond shakeup</a></li><li><a href="#History_of_James_Bond_games">History of James Bond games</a></li><li><a href="#The_next_James_Bond_movie">The next James Bond movie</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">There is no word yet on when Project 007 will be released.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, it's assumed the game will also come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. IO said the game is being developed for "modern systems and platforms."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Project 007 teaser video doesn't show Bond himself, so it's unclear if the character's likeness will be based on any of the actors who have played him over the years.</p><p>What is confirmed is that Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond--the first time ever for any form of James Bond entertainment--and it will be a "wholly original Bond story." Players will "earn their 00 status" in the course of the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that's all we know so far about the plot. James Bond movies are known to be globe-trotting affairs, as Bond hunts down villains across the world. The series is also known for its action, and it's expected Project 007 will include some of this. Bond also sometimes needs to be stealthy, and IO's experience with the Hitman series would seemingly help in this department.</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</h2><p dir="ltr">Project 007 is being developed using IO's proprietary Glacier engine. The company is <a href="https://ioi.dk/careers?panel=job%3Fid%3D5776172" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring a multiplayer programmer</a>, and a previously spotted job ad called for someone with multiplayer experience to work on Project 007. This suggests, but doesn't confirm, that the new James Bond game will have multiplayer.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</h2><p>Project 007 is in "active development" at IO's offices in Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>"Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities," Abrak said. "Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio."</p><p>Former MGM boss Robert Marick, meanwhile, said, "We plan to bring a new take on this legendary franchise to gamers and Bond fans around the world. IO Interactive are masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling." Marick left MGM after the game was announced.</p><h2 id="A_James_Bond_shakeup"><b>A James Bond shakeup</b></h2><p>A major unanswered question about Project 007 is whether or not anything about the project changed due to James Bond stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson getting bought out of their ownership, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">Amazon MGM Studios taking over all creative decisions.</a></p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy. Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</p><h2 id="History_of_James_Bond_games"><strong>History of James Bond games</strong></h2><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><h2 id="The_next_James_Bond_movie"><strong>The next James Bond movie</strong></h2><p>The 26th Bond movie is now in the works, with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond-producers-amy-pascal-david-heyman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on as producers. </a> Amazon MGM Studios will produce the film, but there is no word yet on any of the key details about it, including the biggest question of all: who will play James Bond? Aaron Taylor-Johnson was said to be the front-runner at some point. Also unknown is who may direct the new Bond movie or when it could release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal report from December 2024</a> said Broccoli and Wilson were sparring with Amazon executives over the future of the series, causing important developments on the project to be delayed. Now that Broccoli and Wilson are out, some are theorizing that Amazon might try to get the ball rolling quickly for Bond 26.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Summerfall Studios co-founder and former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider has been reflecting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/david-gaider-interview-romanceable-companions-and-his-cancelled-planescape-sequel">not for the first time</a>, on his career at BioWare under EA. In a brisk recap of a decade-and-change of sequels, changes of direction, and mid-project reboots, he sums up EA's difficulty with Dragon Age as basically one of having no real faith in the wide appeal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">role-playing games</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>"In many ways, Dragon Age was, I think, not a good match for EA," Gaider explained, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard/david-gaider-interview">PCGamesN</a>. "They never really knew what to make of it, or what to do with it. The expectation was always that it wouldn't do well, and when it did do well, it took people by surprise."</p>
<p>EA were far more convinced by sci-fi stablemate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Gaider went on, despite Mass Effect sporadically falling short of expectations. "By comparison, Mass Effect was slick and it was action-driven and very much up EA's alley, so they always expected that it should do better, and every time it didn't, it got excuses like 'oh they released in the wrong timeframe, or X, Y, and Z.'</p>
<p>"The idea was that the potential for Mass Effect was more - it could get the action audience as well as the RPG audience," he said. "It wasn't until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> that they started to realize that 'no, there's an action RPG audience, like a crossover,' but you don't just get both audiences together." </p>
<p>Last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> certainly suggests a level of hesitancy about the value of Dragon Age as a 'pure' role-playing game. Its development was, by most accounts, hellish: originally pitched as another narrative-led RPG, The Veilguard was re-envisaged as a live service multiplayer offering, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/so-i-tied-an-onion-to-my-belt-which-was-the-style-at-the-time">as was the style at the time</a>, then rebooted as a single player action-RPG in light of Anthem's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Gaider - who left BioWare after working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, my beloved - has yet to play The Veilguard, having poured so much of himself into Dragon Age that he feels uneasy about it evolving without him. He's also wary of judging its creators, many of whom have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">laid off</a> or relocated after EA declared The Veilguard a disappointment. But he does regard the game as symptomatic of EA's on-going mistrust toward Dragon Age and role-playing.</p>
<p>"Even though Dragon Age only catered to the RPG audience - at least initially - [EA] kept wanting it to move into the action space as well - and maybe by Veilguard it has," he went on. "I think their idea was that the 'cap' on the RPG audience was only so big. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes along and proves no, it's possible that if you lean into what a genre does really well, you can grow the audience, as it turns out."</p>
<p>Gaider would have liked EA and BioWare to similarly "double down on the choice-driven narrative, double down on the production value, like the presentation of the characters and the cinematics and dialogs, and just take it to the extent where quality is the watchword." But as he concludes, it's hard to imagine a publicly traded company like EA doing what Larian did with BG3, because the two "live on two different planets".</p>
<p>It's not clear what the future holds for Dragon Age. Or indeed BioWare, who have been stripped down to a core team currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA's Star Wars Battlefront II is experiencing a surge in players, potentially fueled by the recent May the 4th Star Wars holiday and the Star Wars TV series Andor. The resurgence in popularity for the 2017 game has prompted some fans--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">and celebrities</a>--to petition EA to make a third game. But it probably won't happen.</p><p>That's the opinion of former DICE live producer Mats Holm. He <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), "I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally." However, Holm said he believes there are people "who are talking about it." In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksxy9m/comment/mtp7jn9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Holm said it would be challenging to bring back the team that made Battlefront II. "We are spread far and wide," he said of himself and others who have since left DICE.</p><p>No new Battlefront games have been announced, which may sound surprising considering the 2015 game and the 2017 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell 33 million copies</a>. A report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">EA rejected a pitch for a third game due in part to licensing costs.</a></p><p>Holm--who now works at Paradox--went on to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ks4y8c/comment/mtmzvd9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pitch his own idea for the future of Battlefront games</a>, saying EA should remaster Battlefront II for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles in 2027-2028. After that, and if it's a success, the developers could focus on Battlefront 3, he said.</p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p><p>While Battlefront 3 may not be in the works, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">a number of upcoming Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream.</p>

			<p>Capcom has been on a pretty incredible hot streak since 2017, with Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, and Street Fighter all playing huge roles in the company's growth and success since.</p>
<p>The company has grown significantly since its biggest series all started to take off in record-breaking ways, and in its latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0ZYaiinJ8">presentation</a> to investors regarding its recent financial results for its previous fiscal year, Capcom laid out even more plans to expand.</p>
<p>A key point in its expansion is the announcement of a new development hub that will be built near the company's headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Reported by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/406072">GameBiz</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-to-continue-upsizing-workforce-by-100-employees-each-year/">Automaton</a>), the building is scheduled to be finished in 2027 and will be a new office meant to help Capcom accelerate its development capabilities. It's described as a new environment where "<em>creators can unleash their talents fully</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also reiterated its plans to continue hiring 100 new employees every year. In an age when so many others are looking towards generative AI and other technology to boost their potential, Capcom recognizes human talent as the "<em>essential driver of growth</em>."</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the best-selling game of 2025 so far, and after 2023's excellent remake of Resident Evil 4, fans of the long-running horror series are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the studio has in store for<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/"> Resident Evil 9</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steamos-3-7-brings-valve%E2%80%99s-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs.1197621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Valve's instructions will walk you through downloading a SteamOS recovery image and copying it to a USB drive using either <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">the Rufus tool</a> (on Windows) or <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Balena Etcher</a> (the preferred macOS and Linux utility). After turning Secure Boot off, you should be able to boot from the USB drive and install SteamOS as you would on a regular Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Note that there's no simple, officially supported way to dual-boot SteamOS and Windows; if you decide to turn your handheld, laptop, or desktop into a new Steam Machine, the only way to make it back into a Windows PC is to re-enable Secure Boot and install a fresh copy from another USB drive.</p>
<p>The SteamOS 3.7 update (officially, version 3.7.8) also includes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084700">a bunch of other updates to the underlying software</a>: version 6.11 of the Linux kernel (up from version 6.5 in SteamOS 3.6), "a newer Arch Linux base," version 6.2.5 of the Plasma interface in desktop mode, new Mesa graphics drivers, and various other tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<h2>A second act for SteamOS</h2>
<p>The original version of SteamOS was designed to be&nbsp;<span>widely compatible with all kinds of PC hardware and was available both from major PC manufacturers and as a standalone OS that you could (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/everything-you-need-to-know-to-install-steamos-on-your-very-own-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and which we did</a>) install on custom,</span>&nbsp;self-built PCs. But these computers and that version of SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">mostly flopped</a>, at least in part because they only ran a small subset of games that natively supported Linux.</p>
<p>The current version of SteamOS launched with more modest aims as the first-party operating system for a single piece of hardware. But by focusing on the game compatibility problem first and leading the way with category-defining hardware, Valve has actually built a much stronger foundation for the current version of SteamOS than it did for the original.</p>
<p>That doesn't make SteamOS a drop-in replacement for Windows—without strong support for Intel or Nvidia hardware, it's not a great candidate for the majority of gaming PCs, or even Intel-powered gaming handhelds like <a href="https://www.msi.com/Handheld/Claw-A1MX">the MSI Claw A1M</a>. And Windows is set up to be a multi-purpose general-use operating system in ways that SteamOS isn't; Valve still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">says</a> that, despite the presence of desktop mode, "users should not consider SteamOS as a replacement for their desktop operating system." But for certain kinds of systems that are primarily used as gaming PCs, SteamOS is a real contender.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has revealed gameplay for the next character joining the roster, Ultron, and showcased more of what's to come in Season 2.5 ahead of its launch next week on&nbsp;<strong>May 30, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The studio also released the latest <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250520/41548_1235575.html">patch notes</a> for the game's most recent update, which includes all the balance changes and fixes made.</p>
<p>The Hellfire Gala Moments event has been extended for another week in the back-half of this season, and on top of adding Ultron to the game, NetEase is also adding a new map and making some significant changes to Team-Up abilities, like the addition of the Jeff-Nado ability.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals: Season 2.5 Kick Off! | Dev Vision Vol. 06" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtEMrHcLDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Season 2.5 will also include a new limited-time mode to be added on June 6 called Ultron's Battle Matrix Protocol. The mode lets six players choose their own hero lineups and upgrade their abilities before going head-to-head against other players. According to a press release for the new update, the mode is "<em>an experiment for how the development team can attempt to fulfill players' fantasies of Marvel Super Heroes and Super Villains</em>."</p>

<p>Season 2 is the last season that'll have the three-month-long structure, NetEase revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/"> last month</a> ahead of the launch for Season 2. Beginning with Season 3, a full season in Marvel Rivals will last for only two months, with a new character and features added each month. Season 2 also introduced weekly missions to give players even more to do on top of the preexisting daily challenges.</p>

            <p>
Stop Killing Games are a self-described consumer movement who are aggrieved about all the games with online requirements that become partly or completely unplayable, once publishers end official server support. They’re trying to persuade larger advocacy organisations like The European Consumer Organisation to propose new laws that put a stop to such shenanigans.</p>
<p>To support their campaign, they’ve carried out a survey of games with online requirements to work out how many are "dead", dying or enduring thanks to developer or fan-implemented “end of life” plans, such as patched-in offline functionality. The resulting Google spreadsheet has 738 entries, of which a whopping 70% are apparently no longer playable or destined to become that way.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can view the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1at1k7qIo5dgPp6K1aCrYIyAgNOjY-IhF/edit?gid=1774166863#gid=1774166863">here</a>. Beware that Google might badge it “suspicious”, because it harbours a bunch of links to publisher websites – it’s possible some of those publisher websites have naughty code, but it could also be simply that Google considers giant walls of links innately untrustworthy. One of the Stop Killing Games organisers, Youtuber Ross Scott, has also put together a video discussing the survey methodology and summarising the highlights.</p>
<figure>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV2bCfm3zVM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GV2bCfm3zVM?autoplay=1" title="70% of games that require internet get destroyed">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV2bCfm3zVM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The survey sorts games into four broad categories: those that are no longer playable, those that are “at risk” for want of plans to maintain them once official support has ended, and those that have been “saved” by means of, say, the public release of the server code.
</p>
<p>
The volunteers found that of the 738 games included, 299 games were “dead”, with 313 games set to meet the same fate in the absence of publisher action. 110 of the games surveyed have been preserved by industrious players, following the cessation of official support, while just 16 had been salvaged by the developers.
</p>
<p>
The criteria for inclusion are a little blurry, admittedly. SKG have made some “judgement calls” about proof-of-concept fan emulators that launch the game in a minimally playable state, which they’re currently categorising as “dead”. The list also includes offline single player games that have online multiplayer components, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Scott strenuously makes the argument that these should be counted alongside always-online games, because it’s not like you can opt out of paying for multiplayer when you buy the game. He adds that, in any case, even if you strip away the games with offline single player components, 68.77% of the games that remain are still categorisable as either gone or going under.
</p>
<p>
The video notes that publishers can be frustrating elusive and unreadable on whether a game with an online requirement will be spared from demolition. A game might be said to support private servers, for example, theoretically allowing you to play it without official server support, but actually require you to access those private servers via the publisher.</p>
<p>
There are many, many online-required live service games currently in development, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">high profile disasters</a> and much discontent about live service as a concept. The fact that so many games with online requirements are "dead" is hardly surprising. Large publicly traded companies are, after all, fuelled by profits rather than goodwill. They gain little from ensuring that those games remain playable, once they're no longer part of the active portfolio. Still, you do come across the odd team or community that have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-completely-missed-that-ace-wizard-battle-royale-spellbreak-had-been-brought-back-from-the-dead">successfully reconfigured a game to survive the apocalypse</a>.</p>
<p>A few members of the Stop Killing Games team are hoping to set up a wiki of online games that face extinction, based on this research. If you fancy pitching in, you can get in touch by emailing deadgamestats@pm.me.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting trading card crossovers in years is nearly here. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy releases on June 13</a>. The upcoming set has been steadily building in hype since its announcement, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-trailer"><u>new trailer</u></a> has since kicked the excitement up an extra notch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to get your hands on the set, you're in luck. There's a lot <em>out of stock</em> right now, but several of the elusive Final Fantasy MTG sets are now back in stock at Amazon, Walmart, and TCG Player, including the <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxJv3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Play Booster Box</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the market price of that booster set has also surged this month. Only a few weeks ago you could pick it up for<a href="https://zdcs.link/akKXAr?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>$164.99 from TCGPlayer</u></a>; it's now just over $179. Amazon had also restocked at $189.99 again (sold and shipped directly), up from the original listing's $144.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4LB7?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>nine-booster Final Fantasy bundle (plus bonus cards)</u></a> for $89.92, despite still being available to preorder for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w7pj?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$70 at Walmart</a>, alongside<a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwAZB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> <u>single sealed boosters</u></a> that have risen from $7.99 to $9.19 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is "Market Price"? Those collecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> will be wildly familiar with the concept, but it's where retailers will take liberties with the "recommended" part of an MSRP, and list it for what they think folk will pay. Capitalism at its finest, I know, and for Final Fantasy MTG, "Market Price" is currently around $20-40 over MSRP, depending on what you're buying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can stomach the cost, with the rest of the sets sold out and some singles already going for over $500, you'll want to lock in your preorders before everything vanishes faster than you can say Chocobo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices in the singles market are looking remarkably high as well, with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY5y6?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a>, currently sitting at $147.23, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Oy5?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Surge Foil version</a> is at an almighty $599, the most expensive of the entire FF set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've already preordered, or are just on the hunt for rare singles, there are a few other clear standouts to keep an eye on in the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the gorgeous <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ7nB?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless Kefka, Court Mage card</a>, shown off in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-yoshitaka-amano-teaser"><u>new MTG teaser trailer</u></a> from PAX East, and featuring longtime Final Fantasy artist, Yoshitaka Amano.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgWvw?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCG Player</a> is good spot for a wide collection of single cards you can purchase and add to your deck without having to hope for a good pull. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a good resource for figuring out how much your cards are worth once the new set is out, so if you pull any Surge Foil cards in your booster pack preorders, you might suddenly find yourself with quite the nest egg. But, it's also worth noting that prices change all the time, so some cards may change in value closer to release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights to look out for when opening boosters, or to consider buying standalone, include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OYxn?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Ex-Soldier Commander card,</a> which costs $45.99 at the time of writing. That’s not surprising, given how easy it makes it for equipping other creatures you might have in play on the field. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's also the full-art version of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xD8y?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yuffie Kisaragi - Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow</a>, currently just under $100. That’s due to both the card’s use as a Commander and its rarity, especially in that classic late 90’s FF7 art style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s when you get to some of the special cards where things get extra expensive, though. Alongside that eye watering $599 Cloud card, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47GKA?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">borderless version of the Traveling Chocobo card</a>, costs $169.98, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03YE3?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">standard version</a> stands at a cheaper, but still expensive $114.97. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also buy the new Traveling Chocobo cards, which even had their own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-limited-gold-chocobo-teaser"><u>teaser trailer featuring a limited edition Gold Chocobo</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it can be expensive when seeking out the rarest cards, quite a number of singles at TCG player can also be bought at a low price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes the likes of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWwVm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sazh’s Chocobo for $1.96</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgw0D?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tonberry for $2.49</a>, the useful <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW7vm?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Summon: Shiva for $1.56</a>, or even <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GXpP?object_uuid=4717d08e-baea-4c18-8b9a-6605ed73a13a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gladiolus Amicitia for 33 cents</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moreover, TCG Player is also hosting preorders for select Final Fantasy booster sets, albeit at over MSRP, but at current market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, for those just preordering the Starter Kit today, it is also worth noting that each deck in the set is preconstructed, and doesn't feature boosters to open (so no surprise $600 cards).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Set First Looks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, it includes one traditional foil legendary creature, five brand-new non-foil cards debuting in Magic, and 54 cards from the main set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kit also comes with four non-foil double-sided tokens, two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-arena">MTG Arena</a> code cards (one per deck), and two deck boxes. That’s a lot of value packed into a $20 price tag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For new Magic: The Gathering players, the Arena code cards are especially useful. You can redeem both decks to play online, giving you a chance to learn the game at your own pace through AI matches or competitive play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More MTG Preorders and Restocks</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-13-2025"><strong>Looking for more?</strong></a> There's also plenty of other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">Magic: The Gathering products to buy now or preorder</a>, such as the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">Edge of Eternities</a> set. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-mtg-sealed-booster-box-in-stock-at-amazon">Spider-Man is also back in stock at the moment</a>, with a few sets still up for grabs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes">Star Wars: Battlefront 2 might be enjoying a player resurgence</a>, but fans shouldn't expect a Battlefront 3 announcement anytime soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's according to a former employee who worked on Star Wars: Battlefront 2's live operations at developer DICE, who has been responding to player questions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Matshelge/comments/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii">Star Wars: Battlefront 2</a>, originally released in 2017, has seen its player count rise rapidly since the start of this month, fuelled by the franchise's annual May 4 celebrations and the critically-acclaimed return of Star Wars TV series Andor. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's renewed popularity has fans clamouring for more — and to be fair, after eight years, you might expect publisher EA to have something up its sleeve. But, according to former live producer of BF2, Mats Holm, that is unlikely to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally," Holm wrote, referring to the recent uptick in Battlefield 2 player numbers. "But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Holm, the biggest issue holding up a new game is that the majority of the Battlefront 2 team are no longer at DICE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spread all over," Holm revealed. "A few went to Ubisoft, some went independent, some to King, Avalanche, Star Stables, Paradox, Starbreeze, Mojang to name a few. Some left Stockholm to join game companies abroad as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Embark has a lot of the people who made base game, but the people who made the live game did not leave in a pack. We all slowly drifted after being put on Battlefield."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Andor Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked whether DICE could still make a new Battlefront game without its previous team members, Holm admitted he was "sceptical." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The live team ended up approaching the game very differently than the original devs," Holm wrote, referring to how the team who continued making Battlefront 2 content post-launch turned around the game's fortunes following a shaky start. "If they went about it the same way as before, they will not get how we brought the game back from the abyss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, if their goal was 'let's learn everything from their work,' perhaps. If they are 'new game, Battlefield but in Star Wars outfits' it won't turn out well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, only "about three people" are left from Battlefront 2's live team at DICE, the developer continued. There's also the issue that, for now <a href="https://in.ign.com/untitled-battlefield-game/230398/news/battlefield-6-electronic-arts-reveals-new-details-for-the-upcoming-game-including-playtest-expansion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE is busy throwing all of its development weight into getting its big new Battlefield game</a> finished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in a perfect universe, the developer said they would like to see the franchise continue — although they wouldn't make Battlefield 3 next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hear me out — no Battlefront 3 right now, but Battlefront 2 Remaster for whatever future console is arriving in 2027-28," the developer suggested. "Dev time is around 2-3 years. There is a laundry list of improvements that this game could get in my opinion, and getting it updated was always on our wishlist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once that is a success, then start work on 3. You have a team familiar with engine, assets and really could kick off developing a 3 within a much shorter time span, and working on feedback from a fresh Battlefront 2 audience base. This would be a 5-6 year plan, but it's far more likely to be a success."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Improvements for Battlefront 2 would include cross-play, day/night cycles and dynamic weather for all planets, a 1-vs-1 mode and more, the developer concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"List is endless, but [these options] were off the table as we were in live, not [original game] production," the developer concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A Song of Ice and Fire writer George R. R. Martin, who wrote Game of Thrones and helped create <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>'s world, is attached as a producer on the movie, as is Vince Gerardis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sigh why? No one ask[ed] for this keep FromSoftware away from hollyweird plz," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktetgx/comment/mtsyb14/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>complained</u></a> one player, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqs5g5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "I was hoping it was just a meme. This movie is going to be a pretty looking mess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are worried about the storyline, given so much of Elden Ring's lore is implied and has chiefly been interpreted by the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the the main problem with adapting any of the Fromsoft Souls games into movies, almost all the lore is interpreted by the fan base, very rarely will the games tell you very directly about anything, a movie can't be like that since it'll try to appeal to the majority of people, so things will be spelled out in great detail, ignoring one of the main attractions of these type of games," one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqvfva/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqt548/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Another</u></a> suggested that while that may be the case if a story was based upon the Tarnished, "a movie around the lore or NPCs? That could work."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Tarnished Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, plenty of players are relieved that Garland has been selected as director, given his love of the game. Even putting aside his game-writing credentials (he wrote Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry), in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jucgre/comment/mm14377/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Reddit AMA</u></a> last month, Garland revealed he was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/director_and_writer_of_a24s_elden_ring_adaption/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>currently on an NG+6 run of Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Have you seen [Garland's] films?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ktd6ni/comment/mtsq30b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked this player</u></a>. "They're excellent movies but they're a bit weird and so they cause mixed opinions. They're very 'artistic' in the sense that a lot of people bounce off them for being 'weird'. This, in my opinion, is exactly the guy you want involved in an Elden Ring movie because he can handle weird."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Garland makes amazing stuff and I was gonna say this is an out-there director choice, but he did make Ex Machina which is all sorts if f***ed up," this player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt4piv/comment/mtqqujq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. "Could be epic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Say what you will about the idea of an Elden Ring movie, but at the very least we’re in the best hands possible with Garland," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9iot/comment/mts3c9e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> this impressed player. "Go watch his video with [Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann if you need any convincing that he will be as true as possible to the source material."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, plot, casting details, and a release date for the Elden Ring movie have yet to be announced, and fans are also speculating on that, too, including a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt9q51/so_is_jack_black_gonna_play_godrick_or_what/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cheeky recommendation</u></a> for Jack Black to play Godrick — or Torrent; I've seen suggestions for both — and another for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kt7rv6/now_that_the_movies_been_confirmed_i_hope/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chris Pratt as a Tarnished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the movie world, Elden Ring has continued to attract gaming fans with more content in the years since its release. DLC arrived in 2024 in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree"><u>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a>, and next week, players will finally get their hands on a completely separate, multiplayer spinoff called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Catalysts are the base power of the spell, with Blizzard describing it as the "foundation." There are six Catalysts to choose from, like Disintegrate and Propulsion, that will give the spell its form and function.</p><p dir="ltr">Next are Infusions, which imbue the spell with its elemental damage type and some special effects. Lastly, players can equip three Arcana, which are used to modify the spell in a variety of ways, from granting players Unstoppable after using their Horadric spell to gaining Stealth for several seconds after use. Some Legendary Arcana grant fairly powerful effects, like the Floaty Bobble Arcana, which adds a Blink component to the spell, or the Bloody Charm, which simply executes non-boss enemies with 10% life or less when the spell is activated.</p><p dir="ltr">The Horadric Spellcraft system isn't entirely different from how seasonal powers have worked in previous seasons (a common complaint among the playerbase), but does seem to give players more flexibility than before in terms of both what powers and what damage types they want to use.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Horadric Spellcrafting will just be one component of Season 9. Blizzard, in its quest, to continue improving base elements of Diablo 4's endgame (as detailed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap</a>) is also putting a heavy emphasis on Nightmare dungeons, with new positive affixes that will benefit players in the form of more specialized crafting rewards or specific types of gear. Players will also (finally) be able to jump into a new Nightmare dungeon while still inside a different one, rather than having to leave the dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">New for the season will be Horadric Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares. Strongrooms are mini-dungeons inside Nightmare dungeons where players will use a wayfinder to find a hidden Horadric vault. Players will need to battle through demons in a set amount of time in order to claim the Strongroom's rewards, and the difficulty of the Strongroom, and its rewards, can be adjusted and increased by activating various modifiers similar to players add modifiers in the Infernal Hordes activity. Additionally, players earn Horadric Jewels to put in their gear to further modify their Horadric spell.</p><p dir="ltr">Escalating Nightmares is a new spin on Nightmare dungeons that sees the effects of three different Nightmare dungeons stack in succession. Players will need to earn Escalation Sigils from Horadric Storerooms to challenge the Escalating Nightmares. Those who survive all three dungeons in succession will then battle against a new boss encounter with Astaroth, who players may remember from Diablo 4's base campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 will be playable on the game's PTR from May 27 to June 3, as Blizzard looks to test the season's new systems as well as various balance changes and new Unique items. According to Diablo 4's in-game timers, Season 9 proper will begin July 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Diablo 4 Season 8, Belial's Return, is in full swing, having revamped the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">endgame boss cycle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">battle pass</a> (the latter of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">hasn't exactly gone over well</a>).

                <p>After Bungie was hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">plagiarism allegations for its Marathon revamp</a>, more information has been revealed about other problems within the company. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">Aside from a toxic work environment</a> coming from the top of Bungie, company heads were pitching to give <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> a subscription service on top of already paying for a PlayStation Plus membership.</p><p>Former Bungie employees spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly belittle staff.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," said a former Destiny 2 developer, which was the focus point for many former employees. When higher-ups pitched a subscription model for Destiny 2, it was only allegedly shut down due to the staff's "vehement" opposition. That would mean players would pay for a sub on top of other necessary subs like PS Plus, depending on your platform. Bungie's leadership followed that up by reportedly holding a meeting where the staff were given a "monetization scolding" for not enabling enough microtransactions.</p><p>Bungie has made numerous changes to Destiny 2's monetization since its launch nearly eight years ago, including a shift to a free-to-play model. The company has had to increase the relevance of the Eververse store and seasonal content passes, both of which include paid cosmetics.</p><p>In late 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Bungie reduced its workforce by over 300 roles</a>, after a drastic fall in revenue. This put even more pressure on different methods of monetizing its games.</p><p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">were part of these layoffs</a> and general sentiment around Marathon has not been the best, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/">its developers are asking fans to give the game a chance</a>, despite the surrounding controversy.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a>.</p>

This clean version of the intro cinematic allows fans and newcomers to more clearly enjoy the newly recorded vocals for the classic “Snake Eater” song.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Although this new version retains the James Bond-like motion graphics and slithering snake skeleton, it features completely new scenes compared to the 2004 original. For example, this updated version highlights the members of the Cobra Unit who were absent from the original. “Snake Eater” has also been re-recorded by its original performer, Cynthia Harrell.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a complete remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. The original story and voice acting have been preserved, but the game features enhancements such as 3D audio and new graphical flourishes, such as Snake's clothing degrading over time. The control scheme has been reworked and modernized, but fans can still play using the classic control setup. Additionally, the remake lets players choose between experiencing the game using a new third-person behind-the-shoulder view and the original game's overhead viewpoint (known as Legacy Style).&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">You can pick up Naked Snake's revamped adventure when it launches on August 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA's reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series was a roller coaster of a journey, to say the least. The 2015 game was liked but blasted for a lack of content, an offline mode, and no campaign.</p>
<p>Then the 2017 sequel was, by all accounts, a noted improvement gameplay-wise, but the microtransactions that EA stuffed into it practically killed the game, driving players away at launch. EA supported the game for another three years and was able to turn the ship around with the removal of its awful microtransactions, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-visuals-improvements/">consistent updates</a> to improve the game, culminating in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-celebration-edition-leaks/">Celebration Edition</a> of the game that gave players access to every piece of content that was previously paywalled.</p>
<p>But neither the reboot nor the original series ever made it to a third entry. Star Wars Battlefront III has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-iii-pitched/">pitched</a> and even worked on, in the case of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-star-wars-battlefront-3-free-radical">original PS2-era series,</a> but never made it to fruition.</p>
<p>Hope rises for Battlefront III once again after a recent surge in popularity in Battlefront II, and (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/star-wars-battlefront-2-devs-want-to-get-the-band-back-together-to-make-battlefront-3/">VGC</a>), developers who worked on Battlefront II want to "<em>get the gang back together</em>" to make Battlefront III.</p>
<p>Responding to a comment on<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3"> Reddit</a> about a previous comment he had made that Battelfront II developers want to see the series get a third entry, Mats Helge Holm, who worked as a producer on Battelfront II, said, "<em>Me,</em> <em>having heard around my group of ex-colleagues, we want to get the gang back together.</em>"</p>
<p>Holm isn't the only one who has worked on Star Wars making the call for Battlefront III. Andor actor Muhannad Ben Amor also called for Battlefront III on<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes"> Instagram</a>, admitting he's a massive Battlefront fan, having logged 469 hours in Battlefront II.</p>
<p>Even with this new surge in popularity, players shouldn't be expecting EA to green-light a new Battlefront game anytime soon. In the thread where Holm comments that he and other former members of the Battlefront II team would like to work together again on Battlefront III, he says, "<em>I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally. But overall, yeah, I think there are people who are talking about it</em>."</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Battlefront II, it's worth hopping back in to enjoy the rush of players filling up matches. But keep your expectations in check regarding the chances of a third game ever happening.</p>

A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
