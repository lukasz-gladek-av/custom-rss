<p>In grade school, I would religiously play through The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in any spare time I could find between studying and schoolwork. It was my escape from reality. That is, until Bethesda unveiled Fallout 3 in July of 2004. Now, here we all are, much older and impatiently waiting for the next mainline Fallout game to launch. In the meantime, do we know the Fallout 3 Remaster release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fallout-3-getting-a-remaster">Is Fallout 3 Getting a Remaster?</h2>



<p>The word around town—by town, I mean the games industry—is that a Fallout 3 Remaster is currently in the works. As revealed by the ZeniMax Management Forecast, which leaked during the FTC case, several projects are underway. Of course, this could change. Microsoft and Bethesda may choose to abandon projects. Still, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-series-65-million-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success of the Fallout TV series</a>, along with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-was-always-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rising popularity of Fallout 76</a>, it would be an absolutely missed opportunity not to capitalize on the hype. </p>



<p>The problem, however, is that Fallout 5 is still many years away. In the interim, we need more Fallout, and the most efficient way to deliver is by remaking or remastering past titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fallout-3-remaster-release-date">When is the Fallout 3 Remaster Release Date?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we do not have a Fallout 4 Remaster release date. There’s no official confirmation of the game’s arrival besides a few leaks and rumors, but it’s certainly likely.</p>



<p>In the past, Todd Howard stated that he didn’t like remakes and remasters and, as such, didn’t want Bethesda working on such projects. However, that’s likely to change under new management at Microsoft and Xbox. Microsoft wants to capitalize on the immense popularity of the Fallout brand, which is currently sweeping the globe, and the timeframe for the next single-player title doesn’t work into their earnings calls very well!</p>

                <p>Recently, an interview with Naughty Dog's co-president (and The Last Of Us co-creator) Neil Druckmann <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-teases-next-game-and-shares-his-belief-in-ai/1100-6523665/" data-ref-id="1100-6523665">made waves</a> on social media, with some of Druckmann's apparent comments about AI (and other topics) drawing polarized reactions. Now, Sony has <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed the interview</a> entirely, stating that the company found "several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values."</p><p dir="ltr">The interview contained several statements that were circulated widely on social media, including one about AI "expanding creative possibilities" and another where Druckmann reportedly said that Naughty Dog's next project could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming." However, Druckmann later went to <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> to clarify that the interview did not accurately report the actual words he said, even providing his own direct transcript to show that it did not match up.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sony pulled the interview less than a week later, offering a statement which reads in part: "In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects)." Sony further apologized to Druckmann for "misrepresenting his words."</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how exactly this sort of thing can happen in an internal company interview, or why it took Sony so long to remove the interview entirely. In recent Naughty Dog news, Jeffrey Wright (who played Isaac in The Last Of Us: Part II) was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-casts-jeffrey-wright-in-same-role-as-the-game/1100-6523708/" data-ref-id="1100-6523708">cast to play the same role</a> in the upcoming second season of the TV show, which is based on the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/who-is-subscribing-to-game-pass-ps-plus-and-nintendo-switch-online-and-why<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Convenience is the No.1 reason people are signing-up to video game subscription services</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft told us that one in ten people who subscribe to its Ubisoft+ service are entirely new to Ubisoft's games.</p>
<p>The data suggests some gamers are partially treating the service to trial or even rent a game they might be interested in, before unsubscribing. In October, Ubisoft saw a record number of subscribers who signed up, presumably, for Assassin's Creed Mirage.</p>
<p>The firm didn't share exact figures, and they're unlikely to be significant, but there's some evidence that subscription has unlocked some new customers for Ubisoft, if not necessarily the games industry at large.</p>
<p>It prompted us to get in touch with Newzoo to see if we can understand a bit more about who is subscribing to these services, and why.</p>
<p>According to the data firm's Global Gamer Study, the majority of subscribers are in Western markets (North America, Europe, and Australasia). They're mostly men (62%) and aged between 21 and 35 (42%).</p>
<p>And unsurprisingly, they're gamers. 52% of subscribers consider video games their favourite hobby, with 34% spending more than six hours per week on console games, and 32% spending the same the same amount of time on PC games.</p>
<p>Overall, subscription users were already average spenders of PC and console games (spending roughly $5 to $25 a month on games).</p>
<p>Interestingly, subscription users tend to have a higher income level (43%) compared with non-subscribers (34%). The definition of 'higher income' varies by country, but in the US that's anyone over $100,000 a year.</p>
<p>It suggests that, although value and saving money is clearly a big motivation for subscribers, it isn't the biggest reason why most gamers subscribe to the likes of Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, Nintendo Switch Online and others.</p>
<p>In fact, Newzoo suggests that "the potential cost savings may not be sufficient to justify the subscription for those with lower income values."</p>
<p>Its data says that "discounts or cost savings compared to buying games separately" is no more motivating to low-income gamers (31% cite this as a reason for subscribing) than it is for those on a high-income (also 31%). Low-income gamers are those earning less than $50,000 a year (and again, varies by country).</p>
<p>However, cost-savings/discounts is the joint No.1 motivation for low-income gamers, alongside "enjoying multiplayer features and online gaming." Indeed, that latter reason is the No.2 reason for subscribing for both middle- and higher-income players. (Middle-income gamers are those earning between $50,000 and $100,000).</p>
<p>The No.1 reason for mid- or high-income players when it comes to subscribing to a service is the "convenience of trying out new games instead of buying them individually." 35% of mid-income players and 38% of high-income players cite convenience as a motivator, vs 30% for low-income players.</p>

<p data-characters="299" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new trailer for the second season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> just dropped, bringing exciting new information about the second course of <em>NieR: Automata</em>‘s beautiful but beleaguered anime adaptation to the series’ fans. Among these new tidbits was an estimated release window of July 2024.</p> <h2 id="h-carrying-the-weight-of-the-world" data-injectable="false">Carrying the weight of the world</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="アニメ『NieR:Automata Ver1.1a』Promotion File 011" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/441v-JXm0CE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">According to the trailer, which premiered simultaneously on X and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=441v-JXm0CE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aniplex’s official YouTube page</a>, the second season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> will premiere sometime in July of this year. If the first season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> is anything to go off of, the second season will feature a total of twelve episodes, meaning that its run will probably wrap up in either August or September, depending on when in July it premieres.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">While the second season is currently set to be released in the summer, <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> developed a reputation for its production schedule. The first season was infamously marred with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567272/nier-automata-anime-delayed-episode-4-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-related production issues</a> that caused it to be delayed twice, so <em>NieR</em> fans have a right to be a little skeptical about the schedule for the second phase of 2B and 9S’s adventures.</p> <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="false">The first season of <em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em> adapted a version of the game’s story through Endings A and B, which are only two of the five endings that players need to arrive at to gain a complete understanding of <em>NieR</em>‘s events. Given what we see in the trailer, the second cour will likely adapt Endings C through E, which completely flip the story of <em>NieR: Automata</em> on its head and turn what appears to be a story of humanoid androids warring against robots into something a bit more complicated.</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’re gunning it to the dropship with samples in tow. But before you hop in, the host blasts you and kicks you from the game, leaving you in your ship with nothing. Lobby kickers have been an issue for the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, but a solution is being worked on. </p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">At least one is according to Arrowhead Games community manager, Thomas “Twinbeard” Petersson. Last week, in a reply on the game’s official Discord to a question about what to do with “arsehole lobby” kickers, Petersson said the team is figuring something out. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">“We’re actually working on a solution to mitigate problems with, well, ‘getting kicked by an arsehole lobby leader’ as someone once eloquently put it,” Petersson said. “No ETA on that, but it’s coming.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-a-solution-to-butthead-lobby-kickers-is-coming-to-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">A solution to butthead lobby kickers is coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="true">The lobby kicker issue has been a thorn for community members for some time. I’ve read complaints about it on the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit since the game arrived. There are no penalties for kicking players without a reason in the game; in fact, it’s relatively easy to do. I’ve been kicked from games before, but thankfully it wasn’t due to a griefing lobby leader. At least a few have the courtesy to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-bruised-helldivers-2-community-finds-solace-with-a-player-whos-become-everyones-new-frend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you know first</a>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">Johan Pilestedt, the CCO of Arrowhead Games, commented on the situation before. In a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1766568830908662092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">message on X back in March</a>, Pilestedt said the issue was “very hard to solve – we have some ideas but no conclusion.” Pilestedt continued, asking for ideas from the community “Hive Mind.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is so shitty. Also very hard to solve – we have some ideas but no conclusion.</p><p>You know what, let's try this: Hive Mind – do you have a design suggestion for how to improve this experience? <a href="https://t.co/HgUlV80fP4">https://t.co/HgUlV80fP4</a></p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1766568830908662092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="663" data-injectable="false">Perhaps one of those ideas shared to the team was good enough to work on. Some have suggested offering kicked players some share in the experience points and Reference Slips — one ideal solution. It’s been a couple of months since the aforementioned message, and it doesn’t sound like the fix is around the corner. But, hopefully, it’s close. </p>

			<p>Sony has officially announced a new PlayStation State of Play broadcast for tomorrow, including updates on PS5 and PS VR2 titles.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numerous rumors</a> about Sony organizing a new PlayStation event later this month, a new State of Play event has now been confirmed. According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/29/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement</a> on the PS Blog, the broadcast will be around 30 minutes in length and will feature 14 titles. As said, the event will include updates on PS5 as well as titles for PS VR2. In addition, Sony will provide a look at first-party titles arriving later this year.</p>
<p>Rumors about Sony organizing a new event surfaced last month when known journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that a showcase would air in May. In addition, he said that the upcoming Silent Hill 2 Remake might very well be present during the event. Although Grubb initially thought that we might be looking at an entire PlayStation Showcase, it turns out that were only looking at a shorter 'State of Play'. Earlier this month, Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Sony would be holding an event later this month. "The PlayStation Showcase is happening this month still apparently", Grubb said some weeks ago. "But whether it's next week or the week after I honestly don't know. Could be the end of the month, but I won't be surprised this does actually happen next week, it could happen at any moment."</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, publisher KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-launch-date-might-be-announced-in-2-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that a new Silent Hill Transmission</a> would be broadcast tomorrow as well. This event will take place on YouTube at 4 PM Pacific Time. As covered earlier, we'll likely be hearing more about Silent Hill 2 Remake tomorrow.</p>
<p>The PlayStation State of Play will air tomorrow at 3 pm PT / 6 pm ET | May 31, 12 am CEST / 7 am JST on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about tomorrow's events.</p>

  <p id="roBwAW">Sony’s next big State of Play showcase is coming this Thursday, May 30, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/29/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday/">the PlayStation maker announced</a>. May’s State of Play will feature reveals and new details on Sony’s game lineup for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23601086/playstation-vr-2-review-ps5-release-date-price-horizon-vr-call-of-the-mountain">PlayStation VR 2</a>.</p>
<p id="lNAT2Q">The new State of Play will stream live at 6 p.m. EDT/3 p.m. PDT on the official PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@playstation">TikTok</a> channels. The showcase will run 30 minutes and feature 14 titles, including an unspecified number of games from PlayStation Studios arriving later this year, Sony said.</p>
<p id="Akb78a">PlayStation Studios’ announced lineup includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22665398/wolverine-marvel-insomniac-games-playstation"><em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em></a> from Insomniac Games, Guerrilla Games’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23513252/horizon-forbidden-west-multiplayer-online-mmo-ps5">multiplayer Horizon game</a>, Haven Studios’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736464/fairgames-trailer-jade-raymond-haven-studio-sony-playstation-showcase"><em>Fairgame$</em>,</a> and Firewalk Studios’ <em>Concord</em>. Sony also has a long list of live-service games that it plans to ship in the next few years, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23734066/marathon-bungie-playstation-showcase-2023">Bungie’s new <em>Marathon</em></a>, and the new showcase could offer more insight into that plan. Of course, we can expect unannounced games too — maybe a <em>Spider-Man 2</em> spinoff from Insomniac? — and updates from third parties, considering <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24057311/silent-hill-2-remake-sony-state-of-play-january-2024">Konami’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23931980/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-konami"><em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em></a> remakes are slated to launch this year.</p>
<p id="2f8kcz">Publisher Konami will follow Thursday’s State of Play livestream with an event of its own: the second <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1795228491539005800">Silent Hill Transmission</a> livestream, which promises new details on upcoming Silent Hill games and film <em>Return to Silent Hill</em>.</p>

  <p id="AVw627">We’re officially halfway through 2024, and so far the year has boasted a wealth of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24074811/best-anime-2024">exciting new anime</a> throughout its winter and spring seasons. With the summer anime season (which runs from July through September) coming fast, there’s tons of premieres and returning anime to look forward, so let’s take a look at what we have on the horizon!</p>

<p id="7Up9fR">This summer has a little something for everyone: reboots of classic super robot anime like <em>Grendizer U</em>, historical adventure epics like <em>The Elusive Samurai,</em> action fantasies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23983973/suicide-squad-isekai-anime-trailer"><em>Suicide Squad Isekai</em></a>, and more. We’ve also got new seasons of great anime like <em>Oshi no Ko</em> and <em>Time Patrol Bon</em>, as well as the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/23164952/terminator-zero-netflix-anime-release-date-first-look"><em>Terminator: Zero</em></a> anime from Production I.G!</p>
<p id="wZRlZu">We’ll continue to update this list as we get a clearer picture of everything this upcoming anime season has to offer, but in the meantime, here are some of the most exciting anime airing this summer that you should look forward to.</p>

<p id="JVtmVw">Fans of Go Nagai (<em>Devilman</em>, <em>Cutie Honey</em>) and giant robots, rejoice: The classic Mazinger series is getting a new anime reboot this season! Based on Nagai’s original 1975 manga, the anime follows the story of the last known survivor of an alien species who flees to Earth after his homeworld is conquered by a villainous empire led by King Vega. When Vega’s forces arrive at Earth, the survivor — now named Daisuke Umon — must join forces with his friends Koji and Hikaru to pilot a giant alien robot named Grendizer to defend the planet.</p>
<p id="gnrlnp">Mitsuo Fukuda (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam Seed</em>) and art director Shun Kudo (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</em>) will co-direct this new adaptation of Grendizer. Tatsuo Higuchi (<em>Fuuto PI</em>) will be the series’ lead screenwriter, while mechanical designs will be made up of a team of veteran artists including Ko Inaba (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury</em>) and Junichi Akatsu (<em>Mobile Suit Gundam Seed</em>).</p>

<p id="WyK2fw"><strong>Release date:</strong> Aug. 29<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="GI8OZi">First <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955474/terminator-netflix-streaming-anime-release-date">announced in 2023</a>, the new anime series set in the universe of the Terminator franchise is quickly shaping up to be one of the most anticipated premieres this summer. Produced by Production I.G (<em>Ghost in the Shell</em>) and directed by Masashi Kudo (<em>Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War</em>), <em>Terminator: Zero</em> will follow an unnamed soldier who travels from a war-ravaged 2022 to 1997 Tokyo on a mission to protect the creator of AI system with the power to combat Skynet. Aside from that, much of the story and characters are being kept under wraps, but from the look of the early promotional images, the series is shaping up to be an intriguing reinvention on the visuals and worldbuilding of the Terminator universe.</p>

The interview quoted Druckmann as saying the studio’s upcoming game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” though Druckmann’s transcript says nothing of the sort. It’s still unclear how accurate the quotes on AI were, as Druckmann didn’t bring attention to them in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his tweets on the matter</a></span>. Sony’s statement reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p></blockquote><p>As for how this happened, we can only speculate, but when you conduct an interview internally, it will ultimately have a PR spin. It’s important to remember that Naughty Dog is wholly owned by Sony, so this was very much an internal affair. Sometimes corporate higher-ups might want to weave a narrative while using a public figure’s influence. Someone at Sony may have been eager to push AI as the future and drum up hype for Naughty Dog’s next game and made some heavy-handed edits. Or, you know, they could have given too much work to a new intern. There’s also the possibility that this could be damage control after the interview didn’t go over well with the public.</p><p>Druckmann is currently working on HBO’s <em>The Last of Us </em>show, which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070">shooting its second season</a></span>.

I’m struggling to find anything else notable.</p><p>But if what you’re after is a large selection of solitaire games to play in your browser, then welcome to Yahoo Games for the new millennium! It’s even got that classic <em>Wordle</em> rip-off called <em>Hurdle </em>that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/todays-hurdle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/todays-hurdle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appears on <em>The Washington Post</em></a></span>. Some of these games will be distracting in the way casual games are supposed to be, but I’m at a loss as to what YouTube thinks it’s offering here that every other site isn’t.</p><p>The games run in your browser, like you’re used to, but this time you’re playing <em>Gin Rummy</em> or <em>Lunch Box Ready</em> with a YouTube URL? It’s bewildering that this could go live without some big-name mobile games beyond a long-forgotten <em>Angry Birds </em>variant, and it’s just wildly unclear what this actually exists for, beyond something else into which Google can stick irritating adverts.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has announced a PlayStation State of Play showcase – following the recent rumours – that’s set to broadcast tomorrow, May 30. It’ll air from 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET and has been booked in as a ’30+ minute show’ that’ll feature 14 titles ranging across PlayStation 5, PS VR2, and the upcoming PlayStation Studios lineup.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mark-your-calendar">Mark Your Calendar</h2>



<p>Recent rumours claimed that <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/29/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a State of Play</a> would take place at the end of May – and Sony certainly is leaving it until the last minute to switch those claims from rumours to certainties. With a whopping 14 games being showcased at the event, it’s anyone’s guess what’ll make an appearance, but there are a few bits and pieces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-days-of-play-event-coming-end-of-may-2024-its-claimed/">that are expected</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spider-Man 2 DLC</li>



<li>Metro Awakening PS VR2 content</li>



<li>Something related to MGS Delta</li>



<li>Words from the new CEOs of PlayStation</li>



<li>V Rising?</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s just one man’s humble opinion, though. </p>



<p>What are you hoping to see at the State of Play showcase?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-lands-open-world-driving-game-from-ex-forza-horizon-devs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New AAA driving game is being spearheaded by team led by former Forza Horizon 5 creative director.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review">Forza Horizon</a> may soon have some competition. Amazon Games announced today that it has struck a deal with Maverick Games for a "narrative-led open-world driving game," which is set to release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/several-forza-horizon-developers-leave-playground-games-and-xbox-to-form-new-studio">Maverick Games, a studio spearheaded by numerous Playground Games veterans</a>, is leading development on the new project. The studio's leadership includes Forza Horizon 5 creative director Mike Brown.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/28/mav-team-leadership-1716927537364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Maverick Games, a new studio by veterans from Playground Games, is working on an open-world driving game.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"We founded Maverick Games with a clear vision: to build a developer-first studio that would foster an environment of creativity and risk-taking," Brown said in a statement. "This approach empowers our team to produce the most exceptional work of their careers. And ultimately, that means we are creating a game that our players are going to fall in love with. </p><p>"As we got to know the team at Amazon Games it quickly became clear that we had a shared ethos – a commitment to giving developers the space to really innovate in service of crafting experiences that players will find truly special. Without giving too much away, I will share that the team here is buzzing with excitement about our game and we can’t wait to share it with the world."</p><p>Billed as a AAA project, the untitled game may be more story-driven than the Forza Horizon games. Its lead writer is Jamie Brittain, whose work includes the British teen drama Skins. In a 2023 interview with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-co-creator-of-skins-became-the-lead-writer-on-an-upcoming-aaa-open-world-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPS</a>, Brittain talked about bringing a TV writing process to the studio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Narrative and storytelling is fundamental to being a human being, and people who are good writers are just a little bit better at expressing that," he said. “If you talk to anyone for long enough, they’ve got a story. And if you tell someone a story, people have got opinions on it. For me, that’s always been the magic of a writers’ room. Ninety percent of all the best TV shows you’ve ever seen are made that way. And it’s a gloriously fun way of doing things."</p><p>Amazon Games has not announced a release date or a title for the new game. Its other upcoming projects include Tomb Raider, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-coming-from-new-world-developer-amazon-games">a new Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, and NCSoft's Throne and Liberty. Expect more news from Amazon Games when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a> kick off next week.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Adrift removes all NPCs, which means no shops, no trading, no shortcuts, and no help.

Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crisis, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>But having to handle such a massive community has also proven difficult for Arrowhead, whose previous games Magicka and the first Helldivers, while successful, were small in comparison to Helldivers 2. Jorjanis said Arrowhead plans to “keep working closely with Sony and improve the game for as many people as possible”, despite recent events. “They're an amazing partner and we really, really really wouldn't have had HD2 if it wasn't for them.”</p><p>To this end, Arrowhead plans to add to Helldivers 2 in meaningful ways to keep players interested in its live service. Some players have called on the developer to take more time with balance patches and Premium Warbond releases after recent efforts fell flat, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">Arrowhead has indicated that’s what it intends to do</a>.</p><p>“We knew it would be impossible to keep up with demand and the insatiable hunger for more fun shit to do in/with HD2,” Jorjanis said.</p><p>“Our singular focus as a studio is to set things up in a sustainable way so that in the long term we can make more and better stuff. We're building a bit of scaffolding before we can make a bigger barn. Queue ‘where's the patch?????’ comments.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And finally, Jorjanis once again called on the Helldivers 2 community to avoid descending into the toxic behavior the studio has experienced since the game went on sale. Jorjanis and Pilestedt <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-its-seen-a-horrifying-amount-of-threats-and-rude-behavior-from-some-in-the-community">called out the surge in toxicity that came with Helldivers 2’s success</a> in a recent interview, and Jorjanis reinforced the point here.</p><p>“I'll be frank and say the same thing most game devs say - when things turn toxic the natural inclination is to retreat,” Jorjanis said. “Anyone who gets death threats (and worse) will naturally want to engage LESS with the community. That leads to a negative spiral with less interaction and more frustration. Pilen and I will always be active - but we will be more active the more civil and fun things are. So I'd ask you to help us to turn this into a positive atmosphere. That doesn't mean you can't criticize - you can! and should!</p><p>“We share well articulated feedback about the game internally, it really resonates and makes it easier for us to do our jobs. We don’t however circulate the posts where we’re told to go jump off a cliff - even if they might have excellent design feedback.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We're building a bit of scaffolding before we can make a bigger barn.</p></div><p>The hope is Helldivers 2 and future games from Arrowhead will benefit from Pilestedt now being closer to game development and less distracted by business affairs. The Helldivers 2 community is clamoring for the game’s next update, which is expected to rebalance many of the game’s weapons. Meanwhile, a third enemy faction, potentially the Illuminate, appears to also be on the way.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Weird West Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>If you'd prefer high-noon action instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/weird-west/" data-ref-id="5000-505929">Weird West</a> is a pretty great game to grab in June. A dark fantasy-RPG, Weird West has lawmen and gunslingers taking on deadly supernatural creatures across harsh terrain. The definitive edition is a more visually impressive version of the game, as it upgrades Weird West to run at a native 4K resolution and 60fps.</p><p>Next on the list is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genesis-noir/" data-ref-id="5000-480616">Genesis Noir</a>, a game where you play as watch salesman No Man in a stylized world of puzzles and gods. Caught in a love triangle with cosmic beings, No Man has to search for a way to prevent or destroy all of creation and save his one true love. While the concept of exploring trillions of years of human history might sound daunting, Genesis Noir is a surprisingly approachable game and it's enhanced by a terrific jazz soundtrack.</p><p>The other games available this month include the farming adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everdream-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-517798">Everdream Valley</a>, roguelike action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mythforce/" data-ref-id="5000-561881">MythForce</a>, and the fast-paced metroidvania <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blast-brigade-vs-the-evil-legion-of-dr-cread/" data-ref-id="5000-531119">Blast Brigade vs. the Evil Legion of Dr. Cread</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/projection-first-light/" data-ref-id="5000-473105">Projection: First Light</a> rounds out the list of June games with puzzle-platforming fun set inside of a mythological shadow-puppet world.</p><p>Amazon Prime Gaming members can also get a few extra games to play through the Amazon Luna channel this month, as Metro Exodus, Bee Simulator, Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition, Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition, Lego Fortnite, Fortnite Battle Royale, Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Trackmania are being added to the library of that service. The Luna cloud streaming freebies are only available to stream in June.</p><h3>Amazon Prime Gaming lineup for June 2024</h3><p><strong>June 6</strong></p><ul><li>Star Wars Battlefront 2 Classic</li><li>Weird West Definitive Edition</li><li>Genesis Noir</li></ul><p><strong>June 13</strong></p><ul><li>Everdream Valley</li><li>Mythforce</li><li>Blast Brigade vs. the Evil Legion of Dr. Cread</li><li>Projection: First Light</li></ul>

Tune in live for updates on 14 PS5 and PS VR2 titles, including a look at PlayStation Studios titles arriving later this year. <a href="https://t.co/B6Uc6aLWKF">pic.twitter.com/B6Uc6aLWKF</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>Sony has no additional details, but Some PlayStation Studios developers we have not heard from in awhile include Asobi (Astro's Playroom), Bend Studio (Days Gone), Bluepoint (Demon's Souls remake) , Guerrilla (Horizon Zero Dawn), Housemarque (Returnal), Insomniac Games (Spider-Man), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us), Santa Monica Studio (God of War), and Sucker Punch (Ghost of Tsushima). There are more, but those are arguably the developers gamers would be most excited to receive updates from.</p>

<p>At the very, very least, I am hoping for an Astro Bot: Rescue Mission PlayStation VR2 port.</p>

            <p>Sony has scrubbed an interview with Naughty Dog head Neil Druckmann from its website after finding "several significant errors and inaccuracies".</p>
<p>Last week Druckmann took part in an interview with Sony as part of the company's corporate strategy meeting, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dogs-next-project-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming-neil-druckmann-says">at the time</a>, Druckmann was reported to have said that Naughty Dog's next title could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming", and that "AI is really going to revolutionise how content is being created".</p>
<p>Soon after it was published, however, Druckmann took to social media to state that his words had been lost in translation, and as such his "words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost".</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, Sony has removed its interview with Druckmann completely. When following the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">original link</a> today, the page has been replaced by a message that reads:</p>
<p>"In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects).</p>
<p>"We apologise to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we have removed the interview."</p>
<p>In short, don't fuck with Druck.</p>

<p>Druckmann and Naughty Dog are currently working on an unannounced game, which the studio exec is both writing and directing. Some have speculated that this upcoming title will be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">fantasy-themed release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Druckmann is working on the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, which is currently being filmed in Canada. Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">Jeffrey Wright had joined the show's cast as Isaac</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us season two is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">currently expected to release next year</a>.</p>

Moana is back, and so is Maui, but beyond that... the first couple of teaser trailers have given absolutely no plot information beyond the fact Moana will be sailing on the ocean. <em>This time, with some more characters! </em></p>
<p id="WpMQVQ">What the new Moana teaser <em>does</em> give fans of the 2024 original, however, is some glimpses of new creatures. And there is one creature that stands out: THIS HUGE WHALE SHARK FRIEND! </p>

<p id="gNSrQQ">Maybe it’s not a friend? I don’t care. I see a whale shark and the only thought in my mind is <em>can I pet it?</em> Hopefully the directors of <em>Moana 2</em> took notes from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511178/avatar-the-way-of-water-tulkun-space-whale-tattoos"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>’s tulkun </a>and Moana can speak to the big watery friend via a psychic link.</p>
<p id="iLPP4D">Anyway BIG WHALE SHARK FRIEND (!!!!!!) aside, there’s not much plot info beyond some other cool new creatures, a few more characters in the background, and some quips from Maui.</p>
<p id="Usgrij">Maybe the official synopsis will help?</p>
<blockquote><p id="B6YxYb">Moana 2 reunites Moana and Maui three years later for an expansive new voyage alongside a crew of unlikely seafarers. After receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors, Moana must journey to the far seas of Oceania and into dangerous, long-lost waters for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced.</p></blockquote>
<p id="aoXm9X">... or not! Mysterious! The gist with this Moana sequel is that it was originally supposed to be a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/12/10/22168776/disney-princess-shows-disney-plus-tiana-moana-baymax-zootopia">Disney Plus series</a>. But in the grand tradition of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/28/18261900/best-disney-sequels-movies-animation">DTV era of the early 2000s</a>, the TV show was retooled into a movie. Hopefully it’s more seamless than <em>Atlantis: Milo’s Return</em> (the bar is low, and yet). </p>
<p id="MEmydN">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Auliʻi Cravalho will reprise their roles as Maui and Moana. Unlike the first movie, which featured music from Lin-Manuel Miranda (<em>Hamilton</em>,<em> Encanto</em>), the sequel’s music will be composed by Grammy winners Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear (<em>The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical</em>), composer and Grammy nominee Opetaia Foa’i, and three-time Grammy-winning film composer Mark Mancina. <em>Moana 2</em> will be directed by David Derrick Jr., who previously worked as a storyboard artist on <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> and <em>Encanto</em>. This sequel is <em>not</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23668412/moana-disney-live-action-movie-dwayne-johnson">the live-action Moana</a>, which is still in development.</p>
<p id="pflTFY"><em>Moana 2 </em>sails into theaters on Nov. 27. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-removes-neil-druckmann-interview-after-significant-errors/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has taken down</a> its interview with Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann after finding with it claims were “significant errors and inaccuracies” in the interview. It comes just days after Druckmann, himself, took to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/neil-druckmann-sony-quote-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter to clarify statements</a> that were attributed to him.</p>



<p>“In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don’t represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects),” Sony said. </p>



<p>“We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.”</p>



<p>One of the biggest concerns from the, now removed, interview was an apparent quote from Druckmann saying that his new game could “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming”. Ultimately, however, it was shown that Druckmann never said the quote attributed to him by Sony. He was also attributed to saying that AI would “revolutionize” how games were made in general.</p>



<p>Other examples of the “significant errors” were mentioned by Druckmann or Sony, but it seems as though the interview not only paraphrased, but created new statements from Druckmann entirely. Whether this was intentional by the writer or another tool was used is unknown.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for more clarification on what the other inaccuracies found in the interview were. Should we receive a response, this article will be updated.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1795805484336734606">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Ed Boon announced that Homelander is officially coming to Mortal Kombat 1 on June 4, 2024, with early access.</p>



<p>This announcement was joined by a new gameplay trailer. This also revealed that fans can purchase the Premium Edition or Kombat Pack to gain early access to Homelander. </p>



<p>In addition to Homelander, purchasing the Kombat Pack will include Quan Chi, Ermac, Omni-Man, Peacemaker, and Takeda.</p>



<p>Boon added that a Ferra Kameo is also coming “later in June.” However, there is currently no concrete release date for the Ferra Kameo. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 – Official Homelander Gameplay Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cesDfTQWFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The most recent addition to Mortal Kombat 1 was Ermac, who the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed last April</a>. Ermac was available with early access on April 16, while the full release didn’t launch until April 23. </p>



<p>So, fans can likely expect the same kind of pacing for the Homelander release. This may also extend to the Ferra Kameo, compared to the Mavado Kameo released soon after Ermac.</p>



<p>Today’s trailer showcases a variety of Homelander’s key moves, as well as a particularly brutal fatality and delightful voice lines. Homelander has remained a fan favorite character from The Boys, and one of the most anticipated additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster.</p>



<p>Mortal Kombat also added a crucial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-krossplay-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“krossplay” update</a> in late February, an overdue feature that fans widely praised.</p>

        <p>The in-app arcade features a collection of over 75 games</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Google has started rolling out its Playables feature on YouTube.</p>
<p>The in-app arcade is available to play on desktop, iOS, and Android, featuring over 75 games including Angry Birds Showdown, Words of Wonders, and Cut the Rope.</p>
<p>Playables is still unavailable to some users, with Google saying in <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">a blog post</a> that it's "widening availability over the coming months."</p>
<p>YouTube began <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/google-now-testing-playables-gaming-feature-on-youtube">testing its Playables feature last September</a> to a limited number of people.</p>
<p>It was then made available to YouTube Premium subscribers in November, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978515/youtube-playables-games-premium-subscribers">The Verge</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-14-best-cyberpunk-anime-of-all-time.883770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-cyberpunk-anime-of-all-time/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-cyberpunk-anime-of-all-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="199" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When on the hunt for the best cyberpunk anime of all time, you need to keep some things in mind. First, robots are cool. Second, lasers are cool. Third, number one is likely to be <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">This list is going to be appallingly biased because we are talking about art here, people. If you don’t understand the concept of subjectivity when it comes to such things, I can’t help you. So, will there be robots? Will there be lasers? Will the adventures of Major Kusanagi and his friends be number one? Read on to find out.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The best Cyberpunk anime of all time</h2> <h3 id="h-14-blame" data-injectable="false">14 – Blame!</h3> <figure data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Blame! | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwy806RC2-Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">While <em>Blame!</em> tends to fall into a more science-fiction category than cyberpunk; I have always considered both its environment and themes as the almost inevitable end destination of what a lot of cyberpunk explores. After becoming massively reliant on a self-sustaining and automated structure to live, mankind finds itself reduced to the grit between the cogs. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">The arrival of a mysterious stranger gives a small tribe a chance to make big changes before their own inevitable destruction. This also contains one of the most ridiculous pistols in anime history. It’s just awesome in general, so it is on the list. My article, my rules.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">13 – No Guns Life</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="No Guns Life | Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQyWoG43kRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><em>No Guns Life</em> is a noir-detective story about a man with a giant gun for a head. That should be enough to hook you on its own, frankly. Juzo Inui is a cyborg known as an Extended, built to fight an absolutely brutal war. Now that the war is over, he has taken on the role of a Resolver. He looks to help normal people when they run into problems with other Extended. </p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Everything is fine as long as he keeps his head down and stays off the radar of the various powerful factions who might have an interest in him. This all falls apart when a young boy needs his help and Juzo isn’t the type of guy to walk away when challenged. Before long, he finds himself face to face with a past he tried to leave behind. This is a fun time, and not enough people have seen it.</p>
 <h3 id="h-12-cyberpunk-edgerunners" data-injectable="false">12 – Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cyberpunk: Edgerunners | Official NSFW Trailer | Netflix" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtqIas3bYhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="true">Trigger Studio hit a home run with <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>. The series set very specifically in the CD Projekt Red version of Mike Pondsmith’s <em>Cyberpunk </em>universe, brought a great cast of characters that lured the audience in, made you emotionally invest, and then delivered an incredible personal finale for each and every one of them. The hook of the series is the focus given to the things that people will do to succeed within the ruleset of their environment, no matter how detrimental the resultant victories might be. Does all the damage really matter if you are winning?</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">11 – Ergo Proxy</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ergo Proxy Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y79dwkgZhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="948" data-injectable="true">You know the story, bad thing happens, the human race is now on the verge of extinction, and we all live in weird little dome cities. It is a tale as old as time. In <em>Ergo Proxy</em>, humans and androids do what they can to survive a dystopian nightmare until a virus results in some of the androids committing murder. Unknown to most, a third element exists in this complex equation: the titular Proxies, almost god-like in nature and perhaps capable of turning the fate of humanity around. This series has become required viewing for animation students over the years, with layers of life-like subtlety that sometimes feel left behind in the industry. </p>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">This one can be quite dense and will leave a lot up to the viewer. They are not afraid to explore philosophy just for the sake of doing so, so settle down and catch what you can. <em>Ergo Proxy</em> is ultimately an exploration of the question that lies at the very heart of cyberpunk: what does it mean to be human?</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">10 – Psycho-Pass</h3> <figure data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Psycho-Pass Season One - Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzuJnyebc40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">I have seen <em>Psycho-Pass</em> unfairly referred to as being worth the first season only. While there is certainly an argument that Season 1 had the stronger cast of characters, this doesn’t mean that the later seasons have nothing to offer. </p> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true"><em>Psycho-Pass</em> is ultimately a show about relationships and how we choose to define them. Everything is viewed through the lens of expectation, as all members of society are scanned; those likely to commit crimes are called “latent criminals,” and it becomes necessary to maintain a clean hue to your Psycho-Pass to avoid a run-in with the law. At the heart of the system is Sibyl, an AI that determines everyone’s fate via advanced tech called cymatic scanning. </p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">While it is easy to focus on the societal, cultural, and psychological themes of <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, the heart of the series is about the ebb and flow of relationships and how we establish or demolish boundaries in our behavior based on available knowledge about individuals and institutions. The conclusion of <em>Pyscho-Pass</em> is that, ultimately, people cannot exist in the domain of each other’s influence and remain static, no matter how cruel the incentive to do so.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9 – Paprika</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="PAPRIKA [2007] - Official Trailer (HD)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIUqozzyW2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">In <em>Paprika</em>, a new form of technology that allows people to view each other’s dreams is co-opted by the main character in a bid to help people outside of the psychiatric center where she works. Things start to go wrong when the machines are stolen, and it is up to our heroine to help solve the mystery of who stole them.</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false"><em>Paprika </em>leans heavily into surrealism to confuse and disturb the viewer, with some scenes playing out in the almost quick-switch nature of dreams. As characters are forced to question what is real and what isn’t, so is the viewer, with things becoming even more confounding as the movie explores the impact that both the real and the unreal can have on each other. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8 – Bubblegum Crisis</h3> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Bubblegum Crisis Trailer (OVA Films)" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGDREScJ5Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to imagine a release schedule like that one <em>Bubblegum Crisis</em> got happening today, but this saw eight episodes released between 1987 and 1991, covering a single season. The story explores Tokyo, which has been split in two by a massive earthquake, with both halves warring so brutally that the country of Japan was to be annexed. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">The main focus lies on the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of hardsuit-wearing warriors who take on rogue robots known as Boomers. Just an all-around fun time, and a sterling example of anime of the era. It would spawn an assortment of other <em>Bubblegum </em>related things, and some other adjacent series like the <em>A.D Police</em> series and <em>Parasite Dolls</em>.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7 – The Animatrix</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Animatrix - Official Trailer [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjtnWqq1-7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><em>The Animatrix</em> was a big deal when it came out in 2003. Produced by the Wachowskis themselves and pulling in some of the best directors and animators that Japan had to offer, this very much felt like the two directors paying back their inspiration by giving them time to shine with an IP that was, at that point, utterly enormous.</p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">A range of short stories explore themes, occurrences, and historical meaning within the universe of <em>The Matrix</em>, and it is likely that this was the first anime movie for a lot of folks out there who were coming of age and had yet to experience classics that are yet to arrive on this list. The contrasting styles and apparent fun that everyone seemed to have with the subject matter make this an engrossing watch. Also, the soundtrack from Don Davis and Junkie XL just slaps.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6 – Battle Angel</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Battle Angel Alita Trailer HD (1993 Anime OVA)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFXpRV9zQWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">At barely over 50 minutes runtime, <em>Battle Angel</em> tries to get a lot of the <em>Battle Angel Alita</em> manga covered in too short a time, but that is the only knock on it. It’s a fun romp through a weird world where young Alita finds herself taking on some denizens of the Scrapyard. I will say that the brisk pacing doesn’t allow for tremendous character development, as you move between story beats quite quickly. Still, the animation is wonderful, the action is cutting, and the voice acting is incredibly endearing. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">5 – Serial Experiments Lain</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Serial Experiments Lain Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5y4nQ5Y1V8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true"><em>Serial Experiments Lain</em> is an interesting fish when it comes to how you wish to define cyberpunk as a genre. In much the same way that cyberpunk will often explore what it means to be human, <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em> does an interesting job of exploring what it means to be real. If a human being is little more than a reaction to a stimulus with no way to confirm shared perception, then which is reality, the reaction or the stimulus?</p>
 <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">After receiving messages from a supposed dead girl at her school, Lain sets off on a journey to explore just such questions, embracing mystery and confusion on the hunt for what is true. The series runs through challenging themes like loneliness, the difficulty of connection even when that loneliness is conquered, mental health, and the aforementioned conflict of the human condition. Being a product of the 90s, there is a deep obsession with existentialism and surrealism that has somewhat fallen by the wayside ever since. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">4 – Appleseed</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Appleseed Alpha OFFICIAL Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DtWCjogd1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">The <em>Appleseed </em>manga has resulted in a bunch of different anime adaptations, and frankly, all of them are a good time. The 1988 original will always be one of my favorites, as it was the second anime that I ever saw. Another adaptation arrived in 2004 and had a sequel called <em>Appleseed Ex Machina</em> just three years later. We’ve had a series and another movie since then.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">For the most part, <em>Appleseed </em>really leans into the whole “the world is awful, but this giant awesome city will keep you safe, except for all the murder” trope. Dual protagonists are badass Deunan, a normal human woman, and Briareos, a former human man. Briareos gets dumpstered in various ways depending on the adaptation and is now in an experimental cyborg body. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">Most of the movies deal with large-scale threats that are likely to kill everyone because some character has gone off the rails one way or the other while also exploring how the change to Briareos impacts his relationship and friendship with Deunan. I honestly cannot think of any of these adaptations that I wouldn’t recommend.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3 – Ghost in the Shell</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost in the Shell (1995 Movie) Official IMAX Trailer - Mamoru Oshii, Masamune Shirow" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8RF09G8Ymqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is another property where you have a lot to choose from. There has been a huge amount of output around this franchise with five animated moves, a live-action take (kinda weak, frankly), four different series, and then a bunch of straight-to-video stuff that ties into it all. The top recommendations would be the first animated movie, the sequel <em>Innocence</em>, and the <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> series. Frankly, bad <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is still better than a lot of other anime on its best day. </p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">The original is a masterclass in animation, tone, world-building, and character development and has one of the greatest soundtracks in anime history. It truly is a fabulous exploration of how much of our humanity we can lose before we are no longer human and how the power of othering people is often a tool used by the most monstrous members of society. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">2 – Cowboy Bebop</h3> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cowboy Bebop (Original Series) - Official Funimation Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhNwckCLzis?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">An absolute classic; its scope and scale are a bit bigger than most cyberpunk, but we can sneak it onto the list because of its noir-infused detective vibes, dystopian setting, and wondrous explorations of philosophical issues like loneliness, separation, and existentialism. Director Shinichirō Watanabe hit this one out of the park and then proceeded to direct <em>Samurai Champloo</em> as proof that lighting does, in fact, strike twice. Often left unsung in the conversation is Keiko Nobumaoto. She was in the writer’s room on <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as head writer and would also write on Watanabe’s other revered works, such as the aforementioned <em>Samurai Champloo</em> and <em>Space Dandy</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Cowboy Bebop followed an episodic format, with most episodes having some form of self-contained tale to tell and an overarching narrative being spun out across all 26 installments. <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> is often used as a way to get people who have a formative interest in anime to experience exactly how fun, energetic, emotional, and provocative it can be, and is rightly considered one of the finest examples of the medium.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">1- Akira</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Akira (1988) Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nA8KmHC2Z-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><em>Akira </em>is, for many people of my generation at least, one of the Big Three when it comes to the first anime that they ever saw and the thing that got them into anime in the first place. In college, everyone knew someone who had <em>Akira</em>, <em>Fist of the North Star</em>, or <em>Ninja Scroll</em> on VHS.</p>
 <p data-characters="618" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="false"><em>Akira </em>has done so much for anime that an assortment of lies and embellishments have swirled for years in an attempt to explain why it has been so impactful. The reality is that this is just good art. Potentially, it is anime done flawlessly, from the story and characters, the tension building, the trust in the audience, the absolutely one-of-a-kind soundtrack, and incredible visuals that helped push the entire medium forward. It managed to penetrate deep into the mainstream long before anime had become just another form of entertainment that we all had easy access to on the internet, which was a feat in itself.</p>

            <p>
Sony has certified a PlayStation VR2 PC adapter in South Korea, as the company readies its plans to make its latest VR headset compatible with computers. 
</p>
<p>
The gadget was <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">approved</a> by South Korea at the end of March for use in the country. As yet, however, Sony is yet to announce it publicly.
</p>
<p>
A report on the device by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certified-regulator/">UploadVR</a> speculates that the gizmo will allow the headset to simply plug into your PC via the adapter device.

<p>
The news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">PlayStation is planning to roll out PSVR2 support on PCs comes as no surprise</a>, as Sony quietly confirmed it was "currently testing" the idea back in February. 
</p>
<p>
Details remain thin on the ground, however - without a firm confirmation of when the support will come or how exactly it will work. But the date of the adapter's South Korean filing suggests we will now hear something soon. 
</p>
<p>
For its part, Sony has said it was working on PC support for PSVR2 so owners gain "access to additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5".
</p>
<p>
Launched in February 2022, Sony has not given an update on PSVR2's sales figures for over a year - though said the device had, initially at least, sold more than PSVR1.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports last year claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-halves-playstation-vr2-shipments-due-to-disappointing-pre-orders">Sony had slashed its planned shipments of the headset</a> following disappointing pre-order numbers (something Sony later refuted) and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-sales-off-to-slow-start-report-suggests">sold less than 300k PSVR2 headsets in its first six weeks</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vr2s-launch-sales-surpass-original-headset-sony-says">Sony also refuted this, and said it had shifted 600k</a>). In March this year, Bloomberg reported again that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-production-paused-as-stock-piles-up-report">PSVR2 production had been "paused"</a> as stock mounted up.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-adrift-expedition-is-available-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-adrift-expedition-is-available-this-week.883749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-adrift-expedition-is-available-this-week/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1795802277787119958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Sean Murray teased the new Adrift expedition for No Man’s Sky, including various details and a gameplay trailer. </p>



<p>Murray elaborated in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/29/adrift-no-mans-sky-expedition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post via Xbox</a>, which confirms that Adrift will be “free to existing players,” across all platforms. </p>



<p>Adrift features a uniquely abandoned galaxy, an alternative universe where players will feel alone. The traditional “space stations, trading posts and alien traders” will be absent.</p>



<p>Exclusive rewards coming to Adrift will include a “gnawing scuttler companion, a supply of starship stealth paint, a ghostly frigate, and the unique Iron Vulture starship.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="No Man's Sky Adrift Expedition Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVy8Wj0CdlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new trailer and Murray’s posts do not confirm an exact release date and time. However, it will be available “later this week,” leaving either May 30 or May 31, 2024. Further, the Xbox post does reveal that Adrift “will run for approximately seven weeks.”</p>



<p>The most recent No Man’s Sky additions include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-major-orbital-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Orbital update</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massive-omega-update-with-free-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enormous Omega update</a>. Omega even gave players a free trial, welcoming new players and adding a tremendous amount of new content. Adrift cleverly subtracts the familiar while continuing to give players something truly fresh.</p>



<p>Last February, Murray also posted a cryptic tease that implied No Man’s Sky could get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-possibly-getting-four-more-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four more updates</a>. </p>



<p>This leads up to the developer’s next project, Light No Fire. Hello Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hello-games-light-no-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Light No Fire</a> at The Game Awards 2023, and quickly became one of the most anticipated reveals from the event.</p>

In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes.  </p><p>The trailer also provides a first look at gameplay for Ferra, a new DLC Kameo Fighter who can assist during matches with a range of support moves.

                <p>CD Projekt Red first announced that it was adapting Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk in 2012, and the game had a lengthy development cycle that culminated in Cyberpunk 2077 getting delayed to 2020. Because the game launched with numerous bugs, Sony delisted Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store for over six months while CD Projekt Red addressed the issues. But now, for the first time in a decade, no one at CD Projekt Red is working on Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>The announcement came as part of CD Projekt's latest earnings briefing, as CFO Piotr Nielubowicz released the company's updated financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion, Phantom Liberty, was released last fall. Since then, one last major update for the game was released in December 2023.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTU0WgwBrvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CTU0WgwBrvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>On X, CD Projekt Red released a breakdown of its development team and its current projects.

The Witcher 4, which the company has codenamed Polaris, has 407 developers currently working on the title. That game is expected to begin full production some time later this year. There are an additional 39 developers working on a Witcher spin-off, which is known internally as Sirius.</p><p>Additionally, there is a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel in development internally called Orion, which has 56 developers as of the end of April 2024.

            <p>
Amazon Games is publishing a new narrative-led, open-world racing game from former Forza Horizon developers.
</p>
<p>
Developer Maverick Games is based in the UK and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-creative-director-and-several-team-members-break-away-from-playground-games">founded in 2022 by key members of the Forza Horizon development team at Playground Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
Its first AAA game is set for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with lead writing from Skins co-creator Jamie Brittain (yes, that E4 teen drama show).

<p>
"We founded Maverick Games with a clear vision: to build a developer-first studio that would 
foster an environment of creativity and risk-taking," said studio head and creative director Mike Brown. "This approach empowers our team to produce the most exceptional work of their careers. And ultimately, that means we are creating a game that our players are going to fall in love with."
</p>
<p>
Giving further hints at the new game, Brown added: "Lots of great driving games have amazing gameplay, amazing content. But to really cross that bridge, to become a game that people genuinely love, then there needs to be that human connection where you're actually rooting for these characters, falling in love with these characters. That, I think, is a place where our game will be able to really differentiate itself from the other titles in the genre. There's nothing about this genre that prevents it from having amazing characters and amazing stories - it's just not really been explored yet."
</p>
<p>
The unannounced game will join other Amazon-published games like MMOs New World and Lost Ark, as well as the forthcoming Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider game and a Lord of the Rings MMO.
</p>
<p>
Amazon also opened a new development studio in Bucharest earlier this month to support with projects.
</p>
<p>
As for Playground Games itself, it's working on the next instalment of the Fable series instead of Forza Horizon. The Forza Motorsport games are developed by Turn 10 Studios.
</p>
<p>
It's unknown if we'll receive more news about Fable at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">forthcoming Xbox Games Showcase</a>, though last summer the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fables-narrative-lead-leaves-playground-games">narrative lead left Playground Games</a>.

            <p>
Exploratory space sim No Man's Sky increasing tilt into the wonderfully bizarre continues today with the launch of a brand-new update, titled Adrift, which this time lets players explore an abandoned universe where civilisation has come to an end.
</p>
<p>
Adrift is, at least in part, a nod to No Man's Sky's earliest days - where lifeforms were scarce and exploration was an entirely solo, wonderfully lonely endeavour against a seemingly endless backdrop of stars. "There's so much we love about the game now," Hello Games says, "but there was something unique at release in how alone you felt in the universe."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Adrift gives players the option to explore an alternative universe of broken, rusted buildings and lost Travellers graves, that's free of other lifeforms, shops, trading, shortcuts, or help - all creating what Hello Games calls a "very different survival experience". 
</p>

<p>
The new universe isn't completely devoid of activity, however; for reasons almost certainly related to the weird, Eldritch pockets of No Man's Sky lore I never quite fully wrapped my head round, sandworms roam this dead expanse, and fiend eggs have spread across planets. Plus, the <a href="https://youtu.be/UVy8Wj0CdlA">trailer</a> suggests spectral entities and other abominations have made it through to the end of all things too.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games - which is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">procedural fantasy adventure Light No Fire</a> - says that while Adrift is a new limited-time Expedition (essentially a several-hour-long campaign built around a series of progression-based milestone challenges), it's also an update that's ballooned to be "filled with improvements, new unique gameplay content, and rewards." It introduces the Iron Vulture - a bulky new Hauler starship and "safe haven" players can acquire as part of the update - as well as ghostly frigates to recruit in space. New ship customisation options can also be found - but, based on what's been shared at the time of writing, it's unclear if the alternative universe will remain accessible once the Expedition is over.
</p>
<p>
Adrift - which follows No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">Omega</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">Orbital</a> updates earlier this year - launches today for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC. Full patch notes can be found <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/">on the No Man's Sky website</a>, and the studio notes there's "a lot [more] planned and still to announce".

            <p>Star Citizen has raised over $700m in crowdfunding, even though it still lacks a full release date.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/star-citizen-crowdfunding-passes-700-million/">Neowin</a>, the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">funding tracker</a> for Cloud Imperium Games' space sim has seen an uptick in donations recently. On 25th May alone, almost $3m was raised.</p>
<p>This has coincided with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-when-you-can-play-star-citizen-for-free">Star Citizen's free play period which kicked off earlier this month</a>, and allowed non-backers to give the game a whirl for themselves. At the time of writing, Star Citizen has raised a whopping $702,634,839. And - again - it isn't even fully out yet, and is still in an early access build.</p>

<p>Star Citizen is notorious for its long development - having been in the works now for over a decade, and its 'whale' status in the video game world. For example, back in January, the team released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">DLC pack costing almost £46,000</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, all of this funding hasn't avoided job cuts at Cloud Imperium Games. In February, it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-hit-with-layoffs-amid-claims-of-a-highly-toxic-company">Star Citizen developer had suffered layoffs</a> amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a "highly toxic company".</p>

</figure>
<p>As for when Star Citizen may get its full release, this remains unconfirmed. The studio's <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/release-view">progress tracker</a> says Star Citizen's Alpha 4.0 update is scheduled for Q3 of this year, but this is still listed as "tentative". However, in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Cloud Imperium Games' CEO Chris Roberts said Star Citizen is pushing towards the "finish line".</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter shared with the game's community, Roberts said "2023 marked the beginning of a transformative chapter for Cloud Imperium", and "all of this points towards 2024 being our biggest and best year yet in the universe of Star Citizen".</p>
