                <p>Former Grand Theft Auto lead developer Leslie Benzies had an ugly exit from Rockstar Games nearly a decade ago when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-5-exec-suing-take-two-claims-hes-owed-1/1100-6438762/" data-ref-id="1100-6438762">he sued its parent company, Take-Two Interactive</a>. Benzies subsequently co-founded Build a Rocket Boy and developed a GTA-like game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/" data-ref-id="1100-6529472">MindsEye</a>, which is releasing next month. Now, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a "concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</p><p>Gerhard recently took part in a Q&amp;A session on Discord (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), where he agreed with the potentially explosive allegation that the negative responses to the game "were financed by someone." Gerhard's response to that suggestion was, "100%... Doesn't take much to guess who."</p><p>Although Gerhard didn't back down from his initial implication, he later clarified that he isn't accusing any specific players of being paid to bad mouth the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbhEMXn_osc" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="23">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rbhEMXn_osc?start=23" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p><p>Gerhard went on to suggest that "there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes" for MindsEye, but didn't elaborate beyond that.</p><p>MindsEye will be released on June 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who has a implant in his head that's called the MindsEye. That device gives Jacob the ability to control drones and a few other tricks. It also shows him glimpses of a mission he can't remember, which results in an unknown faction attempting to kill him before he can piece that part of his past together.</p>

            <p>A Death Stranding anime is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The news was confirmed by the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, who when discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">the upcoming live-action Death Stranding film</a> with <a href="https://www.vogue.co.jp/article/my-view-hideo-kojima-game-creater">Vogue Japan</a>, casually slipped in that an anime adaption is also in the works.</p>

<p>"I am currently working with A24 on a live-action film adaptation of Death Stranding," Kojima said (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-hideo-kojima-confirms/">VGC</a>). "When it comes to adapting games into visual media, there are works like The Last of Us, which stays true to the original storyline, and films like The Super Mario Bros Movie which are more of a service to fans of the game.</p>
<p>"While these works have their own merits, as a film enthusiast, I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema. I aim to create a Death Stranding that can only be realised through film, one that could win awards at festivals like the Cannes Film Festival or the Venice Film Festival. In fact, we are also currently working on an anime adaptation."</p>
<p>So, there you have it! One Death Stranding anime coming up, although for now we don't know when.</p>
<p>As for the film adaptation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">Kojima announced his company was partnering with A24 in December 2023</a>. A24 is the production and distribution company behind the likes of Everything Everywhere All At One and Hereditary, so it sounds like a good match for Kojima.</p>
<p>More recently, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski was attached to write and direct the Death Stranding adaptation</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>But, while all of this is going on behind the scenes, we have Death Stranding's sequel releasing via PS5 next month, on 25th June.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is clearly a labour of love, filled with carefully balanced gameplay systems, exceptional visuals, and extraneous details and secret scenes," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 preview</a>. "I still don't know why we shouldn't have connected, but in this instance I'm glad I did."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In retrospect, it’s easy to see why: it’s a device that seamlessly transitions from a home console to a handheld, erasing the distinction between the two.

This pushed some developers to the margins, while platform degradation soured the experience as a whole.</p><p>Coming out of the so-called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/28/17911372/there-are-too-many-video-games-what-now-indiepocalypse">indiepocalypse</a>, the period after the indie golden age from 2008 to 2015 — think <em>Fez</em>, <em>Braid</em>, and <em>Super Meat Boy</em> — developers were reeling from the massive influx of competition and a decline in discoverability. The eShop, for some time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764956/nintendo-indie-games-switch-yooka-laylee-stardew-valley">was a reprieve to that</a>. Nintendo itself seemed poised to support that period of growth; days ahead of the Switch’s launch date, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764956/nintendo-indie-games-switch-yooka-laylee-stardew-valley">that it had already locked in more than 60 “quality indie games” for 2017</a>.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/will-the-nintendo-switch-gold-rush-affect-indie-games-on-pc/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reported</a> in October 2017 that “almost every indie release on Switch” had sold better on Switch than on other platforms. <em>Enter the Gungeon</em> sold more than 75,000 copies in just two weeks, <a href="https://x.com/DodgeRollGames/status/946866495124049920">developer Dodge Roll Games said</a>, while Team Meat posted in January 2018 that <a href="https://x.com/SuperMeatBoy/status/951949505171144704"><em>Super Meat Boy</em>’s first day on Switch had “shockingly close” numbers</a> to its Xbox 360 debut. <em>SteamWorld Dig 2</em>, one of the titles Nintendo was boasting about, sold between five to 10 times more copies on Switch than it did on Steam, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/indie-veterans-on-the-state-of-indie-games-on-nintendo-switch-versus-steam/">per a <em>PC Gamer</em> report</a>.</p></div><p>Rodrigue Duperron of <em>Spiritfarer </em>developer Thunder Lotus says that the studio “missed the gold rush” when it published <em>Jotun</em> on the Switch in April 2018, but was still “quite pleased” with its performance. (It was published on Wii U in 2016.) “I don’t believe it’s a coincidence that monthly releases to the eShop still numbered in ‘mere’ dozens in early 2018,” he says. Thunder Lotus expected its next game, <em>Sundered</em>, to sell better, but Duperron said the team was “mildly disappointed” — and pointed to the massive increase of games released monthly. “It didn’t feel at the time that shovelware or bargain basement titles were yet flooding the platform, but this was more of a low simmer which would come to a boil over the next few years,” he says.</p><p>2020’s <em>Spiritfarer</em> saw increased success outside of the “indie boom” for several reasons, one of which was that Nintendo included it in its featured section. “More visibility led to more sales, led to being included in the Best Sellers section,” Duperron says. Abhi Swaminathan, founder of <em>Venba</em> developer Visai Games, echoes this sentiment. The game, which was released in 2023, was featured in two Nintendo Indie Directs, which he partly attributes to success on the platform. (Sales remain “almost neck-to-neck with Steam sales,” he says.)</p><p>Over the eight years since the Switch launched, the platform became crowded. It began looking a lot more like Steam, which is blasted daily with new games. The Switch, clearly, is not immune from the low-effort games that muck up the market. In recent years, they’ve gotten a name: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">eShop slop</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">As <em>IGN</em> put it in February</a>, slop games are distinct from the otherwise “unremarkable games” that get released every day. They’re rarely what they’re advertised as, are based on popular or trending concepts, and are rife with technical issues. It’s not really that the eShop has started to rust, just that it wasn’t “particularly sophisticated from a discovery point of view to start with,” <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/">GameDiscoverCo</a> author and industry analyst Simon Carless tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p>“I don’t know if any store is free from the eventual onslaught of ‘slop games.’”</p></div><p><em>Among Us</em> studio Innersloth CEO Forest Willard tells <em>The Verge</em> that the process of getting games onto the eShop is more specific and time-consuming than with other platforms, like Steam. “Many games on the eShop are ones that have gamed the system and streamlined their processes to churn out content (slop), while developers who go through the process with care and intent aren’t necessarily rewarded by the algorithm,” he says.</p><p>But it’s not an easy fix — nor is it a problem unique to Nintendo. “I don’t know if any store is free from the eventual onslaught of ‘slop games’ unless they’re highly curated or gatekeep-y, which would present its own problems,” Innersloth communications director Victoria Tran adds.</p><p>Nintendo has made tweaks to its system over the years, but its biggest one happened recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">likely in anticipation</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">of the Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/the-biggest-discovery-change-in-switch">Nintendo updated how it ranks games</a> in its top-sellers category, changing the ranking from <em>number</em> of sales to <em>highest</em> sales. Carless said this is a shift from three-day revenue to 14-day downloads, a way of pushing out highly discounted games that sell a lot. (Nintendo declined to comment.) James Barnard of <em>Let’s Build a Zoo</em> developer Springloaded says this system “could help to reduce certain titles climbing the charts solely through continued deep discounts.”</p><p>But he warns that it’s not a total fix. “The new system still isn’t perfect, as it seems that the charts instead favor games with higher price points,” he says. “This means we would potentially need to sell three times as many copies as a AAA game to feature as highly in the listings.”</p><p>Game developers <em>The Verge</em> spoke to agree that there <em>are</em> improvements Nintendo can make to help indies shine on its new eShop. Duperron suggests user reviews, while Barnard and Willard would both like to see better performance overall — load times, curation, and search functionality can be an issue. “It’s fine to know exactly what you want to play, but there’s no ‘You might like’ that would get me from <em>Hollow Knight </em>(easily found on the best seller lists) to <em>Unsighted</em> or <em>Iconoclasts</em> (incredible and similar games, but not evergreen sellers),” Willard says.</p><p>Nintendo is trying something like this with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641966/nintendo-eshop-smooth-switch-2">its “Game finds for you” feature</a> so that players don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the eShop, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored">Ask the Developer interview</a> from April. In that interview, Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta addressed performance on the eShop, too, stating that it will run more smoothly even with a huge amount of games. He added that the act of finding a game to play is an important part of the Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p>Nintendo is clearly thinking about the problems of the past, and has implemented some fixes to support the eShop on its new hardware. The key detail, however, will be how it continues to tweak the platform — developers and analysts hope Nintendo won’t simply set the shop then forget it.</p><p>“Nintendo has made some much-needed changes to both Switch and Switch 2 eShop ahead of launching the Switch 2, but we’d like to see iterations more often than ‘once per platform cycle,’” Carless said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I eventually beat the dog but not the rest of the bosses who each have their own unique techniques and weaknesses, like a mashup of <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Mega Man</em> by way of MOBAs and battle royales. You collect runes, level up, find better gear, try to craft a build, and survive brutal fights, all condensed into 45 minute runs.</p><figure id="" data-id="027396274e43ea058749b82cb1bb5993" data-recommend-id="image://027396274e43ea058749b82cb1bb5993" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The whole team is down.

It’s a friction-filled arcade experience just waiting to be played over and over again, every item, quest, and opaque reference explored to 100 percent completion. And one I’m not ready to judge until I’ve tackled it with friends.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is a very particular type of multiplayer game, the one you try to get your friends to play with the lowkey aggressive enthusiasm of a used car salesman who’s about to miss his target for the month. You play up its<em> Elden Ring</em> ancestry, full of enemies and sights from one of the best games of the decade. The moment-to-moment combat remains familiar but dialed up with much faster movement and special ability cooldowns. <em>Nightreign</em> is full of haunting iconography and spectacular boss fights, hallmarks of FromSoftware games you can now enjoy together over voice chat in real time. </p><p>What you don’t tell them is that <em>Nightreign</em> is a messy mishmash of other genre mechanics that don’t always mesh together, especially with the grace and high degree of craft players have come to expect from the studio behind <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. You don’t mention the frenetic and occasionally repetitive scrambles to farm resources during the day in time for the boss fights at night, or the fact that <em>Nightreign</em> feels like a loot-driven numbers game that doesn’t want you to easily understand how any of its math works. You definitely don’t talk about how the matchmaking systems seem archaic, or how, despite the ability to play solo offline, that is not something your friends will ever want to actually bother with unless FromSoftware drastically nerfs the difficulty at some point.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dd62c3811f7699515af6a018bba46c05" data-recommend-id="image://dd62c3811f7699515af6a018bba46c05" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant boss moves through a cave.

When you struggle together for hours on a tough challenge, learning encounters and boss fights, training both your mind and muscle memory to play a specific role that will contribute to the overall group’s success, it can be the highest of gaming highs, magnified by the shared experience of what it took to get there and the personal stories and anecdotes that flow from that. But when victory never comes or weak links in the chain become impossible to conceal, people get angry, they log off, they uninstall.</p><p>That might sound like a major red flag for the millions of people who played and enjoyed <em>Elden Ring </em>and have either never heard of Bungie’s sci-fi MMO or  <em>have </em>heard of it and learned early on to stay as far away from it as possible. It might also be why <em>Nightreign</em> is just $40, the same price of last year’s GOTY-nomination-worthy <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>expansion. Not because it isn’t a full-fledged game but because, unlike <em>Elden Ring</em>, it does not contain all of the tools you need to enjoy it right out of the box. <em>Nightreign</em>’s secret sauce is other human beings, and that is not something FromSoftware can patch in later after the game is out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a weird one. It takes the foundation of one of the best open-world RPGs of a generation and turns it into not just a roguelite where death is even more of a big deal, but a three-person, co-op-focused roguelite. And in many ways, that strange experimental concoction is a success. Under the right conditions, Nightreign’s 45-ish minute runs are positively thrilling. They are packed with surprising encounters, challenging decisions, satisfying opportunities for teamwork, and some of the best boss battles FromSoftware has ever come up with – and that’s a very high bar. The <em>big </em>problem, however, is that those right conditions are far more difficult to create than they should be. You really need to have a consistent squad of similarly skilled players that are able to devote hours at a time in order to see what makes Nightreign special – and when you don’t, the flaws of its design are magnified tenfold. There<em> is</em> excellence in this Elden Ring spin off, but it’s excellence that is just a little bit tarnished. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: If you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand why, we first need to go over what Nightreign even is. On a very basic level, this is a roguelite that takes place on an island called Limveld, which is kind of like a melting pot of Elden Ring’s environments, enemies, bosses, and structures. The general flow of a run is split up into a three-day cycle: On days one and two, it’s all about farming gear, defeating bosses, and leveling up so that you’re as prepared as possible when you face off against one of the eight extremely difficult Nightlord bosses on day three. It’s a great formula, and while you might think that the mostly static map would get old after a while, there’s a good amount of procedural generation every run that mixes up the locations of every point of interest, requiring you to plan out a unique route on each new attempt. On top of that, there are also random events like boss raids, summoning portals, and other occurrences that inject a heavy level of chaos every once in a while. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Random events inject a heavy level of chaos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Efficiency is key because you are on a very strict time limit, with a battle royale-esque circle that constricts at set points throughout the day, eventually shrinking to the size of a small battlefield and setting the stage for the boss battle that ends the night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is immediately obvious that Nightreign was designed with a three-player squad in mind. Enemy encampments that don't require you to fight a single boss will instead have you spread out to takedown three tough enemies; basic encounters against five or more enemies that would be trivial with three players become costly time wasters when you’re on your own; and the new Nightlord bosses all seem explicitly designed with having allies in mind, and I’m not sure how I’d approach several of them by myself. Nightreign at least scales up your damage when you’re alone, but it doesn’t change any of these fundamental design decisions in any way that would make solo play more reasonable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure how I’d approach several of the bosses by myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the biggest issue is that co-op partners are able to revive each other when someone goes down, but you’ve only got one life to live when you’re on your own. That’s generally the case in roguelites, but usually there’s some sort of safety net that you can fall back on. For example: Hades has Death Defiances, and part of the progression of that game allows you to work toward unlocking more of them with every run; Returnal has artifacts you can find that give you extra lives, rewarding you for being more thorough in your exploration; Spelunky has shortcuts that allow you to skip the early stages and get practice on the enemies, traps, and bosses you only have limited experience with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The list goes on and on, but Nightreign has virtually nothing to make up for the fact that solo players lose access to that crucial revival option. There is an item that will resurrect you once with half of your life, but it’s limited to the highest rarity tier, meaning you have to choose it over a legendary weapon if one does appear as a reward – similarly, you may find them in a shop, but they cost a substantial amount of runes that you could instead use to level up. Either way, it’s just not a solution that makes up for the crippling detriment of not having someone to revive you if you go down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say that solo play is outright impossible, and I <em>have </em>had a few successful runs on my own. Just that the balancing of solo play feels like a job half finished, and as a result, the frustration of playing alone wasn’t worth the triumph for me to have any desire to play more without a squad. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>It Takes Three</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign’s saving grace is that when you <em>do </em>have a squad of three people who all know what they’re doing, communicate well, and are generally pretty skilled at Elden Ring, it really is a lot of fun. The central idea of taking an entire game’s worth of progression and condensing it into a 40-minute run is a strong one. Going from cutting down rats with a basic weapon to culling Elden Ring’s most fearsome bosses with a badass armament that you may or may not have gotten to use in the main game is one of the coolest and most satisfying parts. It's 80+ hours of character growth condensed into less than an hour and shot straight into your veins.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping into a run the first couple of times is certainly overwhelming, mostly because of the amount of information on the minimap you have to process, but at least FromSoft keeps the inventory and stat management very simple. Level ups are automatic, letting you press a button at a Site of Grace to automatically level your class’s preferred stats. And as far as weapon stats go, all you have to worry about here is the damage number, the elemental affinity, the passive bonus you get simply for having the weapon in your inventory, and the weapon skill that comes along with it. This meant when I had a choice between three rewards, I was able to very quickly make a judgment on what I needed at that moment and continue on my way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>FromSoft keeps the inventory and stat management very simple.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I started to understand what rewards were offered at which camps, which ones were quick and could be cleared before the circle closed in, which ones I should only do if I had a lot of extra time, what level I should attempt certain roaming bosses, and which bosses I should absolutely avoid unless my team was really confident in our builds. Exploring these areas can be more frustrating than it needs to be thanks to a new wall climbing ability that feels straight up bad, especially when it takes three attempts to jump over what looks like it should be an easily scalable wall as you’re trying to escape the encroaching circle. But learning the ins and outs of the map helped my efficiency and led to a very satisfying feeling of skill progression that wasn’t tied to the <em>actual </em>progression system that offers persistent improvements between attempts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That system is tied to relics that can be won after completing a run. Whether you win or lose, you still get relics, but the better you perform, the better the quality and quantity of relics you earn. These can be equipped before a run and impart stat bonuses, starting skills or elemental affinities for your initial weapon, buffs for performing certain actions, and in some cases, they can even improve the skills of a specific class. When you’re just starting out, these bonuses are hardly noticeable and too random to really make any sort of compelling build from. Eventually though, with enough runs under your belt, you’ll get some powerful relics that can really start to have an effect on your power level in a run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there really should be more of an element of choice with regards to the meta progression, or at least a way to control some of the randomness. There are a small selection of relics that you can buy at the Jar Shop inside your base before runs, and there are set relic rewards for beating Nightlord bosses and completing class-specific objectives called remembrances – but other than that, you’re completely at the mercy of the RNG gods when it comes to what relics you get. It can be really annoying when you’re looking to strengthen your preferred class and you keep getting relics that don’t do anything for you. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Select Your Nightfarer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest departures compared to what we’re used to from Elden Ring is that the classes are now <em>actual </em>classes, with unique skills and gameplay styles as opposed to soft classes that just determine your starting stats and weapons. They’re called Nightfarers, and the eight options are varied and well defined, with even the more basic archetypes having some interesting twists to them. The Wylder, for instance, is the general jack of all trades, but also has access to a nifty grappling hook that can be used to pull weak enemies towards you, zip you toward larger enemies, or simply zoom you around the field at high speeds if you aim it at the ground. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the basic fighter, mage, and ranger archetypes, you also have a few completely unique choices that don’t fit into any pre-existing mold. One of the most interesting classes is the Executor, whose main skill has you pulling out a unique sword with a Sekiro-like parrying mechanic tied to it. Basically, by blocking attacks with proper timing, you completely negate damage, don’t lose any stamina, and reduce the enemy’s own stamina, potentially opening them up for a critical hit. It’s a very risky class, especially in a game where missing a parry can mean almost certain death, and it feels like the offensive power of the Sekiro sword is too weak to justify the risk of the parries, but I appreciate this inclusion nonetheless as both a nod to Sekiro, and as a completely different way to approach combat. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses are almost all unlike any boss FromSoft has designed before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, each of the classes has a remembrance tied to them, which is essentially a collection of journal entries that chronicle the story of how they wound up in Limveld and their purpose for being there. It’s a far cry from the rich lore that we’re used to in FromSoft games, but at least each remembrance has a handful of playable chapters that have you completing specific objectives in order to earn powerful relics, as well as a healthy amount of runes to help you level up during the actual run itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost all of Nightreign is made up of existing Elden Ring parts, but there are a few surprise bosses that are pulled from the Dark Souls series as well. But the eight Nightlords are brand new, and hoo boy, they’re almost all unlike any boss FromSoft has designed before. Many of them are clearly inspired by MMO boss battles, with a number of party-wiping attacks that must be stopped or interrupted before they get a chance to finish their preparation. Others are designed to split the party up into roles to either hold aggro or press the assault, and some are just designed to be all out wars against absurdly aggressive foes. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">They’re almost all bangers, with only one of them being a dud due to the best strategy simply being hanging back and pelting them with arrows for what felt like an hour. Still, seven out of eight is pretty great, especially when those seven are among the very best FromSoftware has ever crafted, with excellent accompanying soundtracks to match. I don’t want to spoil them too much, but the fight against the Fissure in the Fog boss in particular is so good it gave me goosebumps all throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the creativity of those bosses once again shines a light on the eldritch elephant in the room: they only really work with a team, and by far the two biggest issues facing Nightreign right now are, one, the shocking lack of crossplay and two, the absence of a duos playlist (you will be forced to fill the third player with matchmaking). It is simply a lot to ask of a group of three people who all must have purchased the $40 game, play on the same platform, be of a similarly matched skill to be able to handle the extreme challenge of the day 3 bosses, have the time to devote at least 45 minutes per run, and also can all agree on fighting the same boss that they may or may not all need to beat for their own individual progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a decent pinging system that at least makes it possible for light communication with a group of randos, but there’s no built-in voice chat, which makes nuance like trying to communicate that your group should hit the basement of the castle instead of the front or side entrance virtually impossible. It’s just a night and day difference when you’re able to group up with a squad that communicates well and knows what they’re doing versus when you’ve got one that doesn’t listen to you or just constantly makes bad decisions, especially with no way to vote to cancel or quit out of a run without a penalty. That makes the prospect of random matchmaking on the live servers pretty unappealing. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Yuri Lowenthal, a voice actor who portrayed Yosuke Hanamura in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-4-golden/" data-ref-id="5000-115427">Persona 4</a>, seemingly revealed that a Persona 4 remake was in the works in a Bluesky post about not being invited back. Atlus has still not confirmed a remake of this RPG classic is in the works.</p><p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remarked on Bluesky</a>. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p>Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have been swirling ever since Persona 3 Reload launched last February. These rumors have gained traction in recent months, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jvwo7r/according_to_extas1s_gears_collection_silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers like extas1s</a> claiming that it will be revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase. Atlus has not commented on these rumors at all, though, so Lowenthal's comments are the first we've heard about a Persona 4 remake from anyone who could potentially be in the know about it.</p><p>If true, it's disappointing to hear that Lownethal won't return to portray Yosuke in a potential remake of Persona 4. It would line up with Atlus' approach to voice acting for Persona 3 Reload, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reloaded-will-feature-an-entirely-new-voice-cast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no voice actors from the original</a> portrayed their characters in that remake either. Lownethal's comments suggest that this is a deliberate choice on Atlus' part, not related to voice actor availability, and that other Persona 4 voice actors also won't be returning to portray their iconic characters.</p><p>If the rumors are true and a Persona 4 remake is real, it seems like Atlus could reveal it during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>.

However, if a recent post on Bluesky by voice actor Yuri Lowenthal is anything to go by, it sounds like it's a real thing.</p><p>Lowenthal voiced Yosuke Hanamura, one of the main characters in the original Persona 4. Today on Bluesky, Lowenthal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">posted</a> the following: “And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake.

Considering he apparently received a “no” on returning, it seems like the Persona 4 remake is happening… just without him. This is a bummer for Lowenthal and fans of the original game, but not surprising. Atlus and Sega brought on a new voice cast for last year’s Persona 3 remake, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em> has contacted Sega to ask about Lowenthal’s post and if the rumored Persona 4 remake is real.

            <p>A voice actor from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> has confirmed a rumoured remake is indeed in development.</p>
<p>Yuri Lowenthal, also known as the voice of Spider-Man in Insomniac's superhero series, was the voice of Yosuke in the original release of Persona 4 back in 2008 (as well as the protagonist of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>).</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">post on social media</a>, the actor has stated he won't be returning for the Persona 4 remake - despite the fact Atlus itself hasn't confirmed its existence.</p>

<p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a> was the game to truly give the Japanese RPG series huge success, Persona 4 was arguably the game that popularised it by building on the formula of its predecessor. In short, Persona 4 is particularly popular among fans, and the rumoured remake is highly-anticipated.</p>
<p>It would follow the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> last year, which enhanced the 2006 original with elements of the more recent Persona 5. Fans have therefore expected a similar remake of the fourth game to follow suit.</p>
<p>Even more eagerly anticipated is the expected Persona 6, though little is known beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-6-will-be-coming-to-multiple-platforms-leak-suggests">leak suggesting it's coming to multiple platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-the-phantom-x-coming-to-pc-and-mobile-next-month">Persona 5: The Phantom X is due out next month</a> on PC and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With the video games industry being ever more averse to taking risks and launching new IPs, last year's release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a> was a breath of fresh air. While the game developed and published by CAPCOM failed to set the sales charts on fire, the tower defense-meets-action game was, by every metric, a fine game that deserved more recognition and success, which the soon-to-be-released Nintendo Switch 2 port could bring, considering the experience is sure to work well in handheld format and with mouse controls. The Nintendo Switch 2 port of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will also feature a new play mode called Otherworldly Ventures, which is also coming to other versions of the game to provide better replay value.</p>
<p>The Otherworldly Ventures mode is a sort of replayable "endless" mode with some light roguelike elements powered by a more streamlined version of the game's formula set in the same locations seen in the campaign, but with rearranged elements. Villagers, for example, don't have to be rescued; crystals are much easier to come by; contraptions, barriers, and other structures are located in different places than in the original maps, and can be repaired instantly; Soh doesn't have to guide Yoshiro to purify gates, only protect her. At the beginning of an Otherworldly Ventures run, Soh will come with limited abilities, and can only assign the roles of Woodcutter and Archer to the available Villagers, but after clearing a Seethe wave, it will be possible to pick one among a few available upgrades, including additional Rations, new Villagers, new Masks, higher defense, increased damage and so on. Items and new abilities can also be purchased during waves as well with enough crystals, providing players with every option they need to survive the night and take on the next wave. After enough waves have been completed, the stage will change, repeating the loop until the final stage, or Yoshiro's health has been depleted. In Hard difficulty mode, the Otherworldly Ventures mode can go on indefinitely, though waves will progressively become more challenging, as the health of any character is not replenished automatically. At the end of each run, the player's performance will be scored, accompanied by several rewards that provide some incentive to engage with the new play mode.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250528114418_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though the new Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess play mode doesn't shake up the experience much, the faster pace makes the Otherworldly Ventures mode a fine addition to the game. And a rather challenging one to boot, as right from the onset, you will be dealing with powerful Seethe that only appear later in the campaign, so if you haven't played the game in a while, it will take some time to get back into the swing of things. After this happens, however, the new play mode becomes quite enjoyable, so much so that it could be difficult for some to return to the slower pace of the main campaign.</p>
<p>Twisting the main campaign's formula only slightly, and unlocking only after completing the campaign, the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures mode is not going to change anyone's opinion on the game, as only those who liked it enough to complete the campaign will get to experience it. Still, it is a great way to put one's skills to the test, and a solid addition to an already solid game that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>The Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Otherworldly Ventures additional content will get added to the PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S with a free update on June 5th, the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 port releases worldwide.</p>
<p><em>Tested on PC. Early access provided by the publisher.</em></p>

			<p>We've been hearing <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">for a while now</a> that a Persona 4 Remake was on its way, but now the game is all but officially confirmed by Atlus after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man</a> and Yosuke voice actor, Yuri Lowenthal, posted about not being asked back to reprise his role as Yosuke.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">In a post on Lowenthal's personal BlueSky account</a>, as a response to people who have been asking Lowenthal about the upcoming and not-yet-officially-confirmed remake, he wrote "<em>And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don't want me to come back</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif7qijwd43romugsgml5j2ee7gpah36vaz2lacnvrzogoyosqzygq">
<p lang="en">And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake. I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5?ref_src=embed">Yuri Lowenthal (@yurilowenthal.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:nsyqlbwtvzs4iu37szt3ndn5/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r?ref_src=embed">2025-05-28T13:37:47.019Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So not only does Lowenthal seemingly confirm that the rumors about a Persona 4 remake coming have been true, he also confirms that, at least in his case and likely in the case of the rest of the original voice cast, Atlus is taking the same route it took for Persona 3 Reload and recasting the core characters in the game.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/">Persona 3 Reload's success</a>, it could be that the decision not to ask Lowenthal back came from Atlus trying to take the same steps it took with Persona 3 Reload to repeat that success with the Persona 4 Remake. We'll likely never know exactly why Lowenthal and potentially the rest of the voice cast aren't coming back, but Lowenthal's words seem to make it clear he's not too happy about the decision.</p>
<p>Regardless, hopefully, Persona fans don't have to wait too much longer to get the official confirmation we all know is coming. Summer Game Fest 2025 is around the corner, and there's always a good chance an announcement like this could appear at Keighley's big showcase.</p>

But it’s all been leakers and insiders sharing tidbits and possible information, nothing concrete. However, with a famous voice actor from the original game talking openly about the project and implying that it might have recast some characters, it seems the cat is out of the bag, even if Sega and Atlus didn’t plan on that happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 28, Lowenthal posted on BlueSky</a></span>—in response to fans asking him about the remake and his return—saying that he wasn’t coming back despite possibly begging Atlus to return. </p><p>“And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the <em>Persona 4 </em>remake,” posted Lowenthal, who also voices Spider-Man in the Insomniac games on PS4/PS5. “I asked.

So it seems that Atlus might be doing the same thing again, assuming <em>Persona 4</em> remake is real and happening. And it wouldn’t be the first time:&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em> was previously partially remastered and improved. That version of the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/persona-4-golden"><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></a></span>, was then ported to Vita in 2012 and consoles and PC in 2020. </p><p>As for why Lowenthal, a famous voice actor with a long career in the industry, would seemingly leak a project ahead of an official announcemen? Well, perhaps the rumors have been swirling for so long that he forgot it wasn’t actually official yet. Or maybe he was grumpy about not being cast.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Call of Duty: Mobile's latest crossover event is coming soon, and it's not what we expected. The mobile shooter is getting a Nie: Automata crossover beginning May 30, promising a range of themed items based on the franchise for Call of Duty players.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/05/call-of-duty-mobile-season-five-primal-reckoning" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nier crossover</a>, players take control of the YorHa Unit as they fight against Machine Lifeforms, Activision said in the announcement. Players can complete objectives in the game to earn rewards, including the Kui Ji - YoRHa No. 9 Type S operator. Four new NieR-themed melee weapons are included in the crossover event, too, along with the AK-47 Final Apocalypact weapon.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at the Nier crossover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGyui44MEU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YMGyui44MEU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty: Mobile is developed by Tencent's TiMi Studios.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-new-%E2%80%9Chigh-performance%E2%80%9D-mode-delivers-higher-fps-than-performance-mode-with-minimal-impact-on-image-quality.1200594/</guid>

			<p>The custom NVIDIA DLSS 4 "High Performance" mode strikes a good balance between the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, delivering image quality on par with the latter with better performance.</p>
<p>A comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows games like Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, STALKER 2, The Witcher 3 next-gen and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running on an RTX 4070 at 1080p with the official NVIDIA DLSS 4 Performance and Ultra Performance mode and the "High Performance" mode which can be enabled in the NVIDIA App by setting the Ovrerride Super Resolution to 42% input resolution. The custom mode essentially delivers the same image quality as the vanilla Performance mode but with better performance in most of the tested games, and with noticeably better image quality in some games like The Witcher 3 next-gen over Ultra Performance mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 New High Performance Mode - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4070" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qNaG2ve5Uo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the release of the NVIDIA App earlier this year, it has become possible to tweak NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution with different input resolutions, giving users more control over how the upscaler behaves. Besides the "High Performance" mode showcased in the video below, the App also allows users to use the Ultra Quality mode that was added to the upscaler a while back but has never been properly implemented, allowing users to enjoy<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-ultra-quality-mode-better-perfromance-image-quality-dlaa/"> better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality.</a></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 officially launched together with the RTX 50 series GPUs, introducing a new Transformer model that delivers better image quality than the old CNN model, Multi Frame Generation for the latest RTX GPU generation and more. More information on these new features can be found <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-set-for-june.1200588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-3-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forever Entertainment has revealed that mech RPG&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is launching next month, completing the set of remakes for the original PlayStation-era trilogy.</p>

<p>Following on from 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">remake-of-a-remake</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-for-nintendo-switch-delayed-to-q3-2023" rel="nofollow">the following year's</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 2: Remake</em>, the latest entry in the series will be arriving on June 26th, per a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no Nintendo Switch 2 Edition version of the game has been announced, so it sounds like it won't be getting any Switch 2 enhancements at launch, at the very least. It's entirely possible that's coming in the future, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=Ai3I8Rkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=3GiU7iWC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is set for release in June.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also no word yet on whether&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>will be coming to other platforms, although given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-steam" rel="nofollow">both of its predecessors</a> were eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-pc-console-release-date" rel="nofollow">released outside of the Switch ecosystem</a>, it's a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3&nbsp;</em>was the first game in the series to make it outside of Japan, as well as the franchise's final numbered release on the original PlayStation (if we don't count&nbsp;remake&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st</em>, which also wasn't released in the West in its PS1 form).</p>

<p><em>Front Mission 3</em>'s plot revolves around pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama, who are caught up in one of the&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>series' signature political conflicts. As tensions rise and military zones become more "volatile", Kazuki and Ryogo must pilot their "wanzer" mechs to survive.</p>

<p>Just as with previous&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>remakes, you can expect this one to come complete with a number of improvements, including sharper visuals, smoother performance, and gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Forever Entertainment intends to continue remaking&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>games; if so, the next logical candidate in the string would be 2003's&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 4</em>, the first series entry on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on June 26th. It will likely also be playable on Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While “auteurism” can sometimes feel like a pretentious label, there’s a real thrill in watching a creator unapologetically pour their tastes into their work. Doubly so if it’s some freaky shit. Mangaka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paru_Itagaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paru Itagaki</a>’s new ghost cuckold manga proves that she knows how to let her freak flag fly without getting lost in the weeds of her kinky illustrations.</p><p>Paru Itagaki may be the daughter of <a href="https://kotaku.com/baki-hanma-netflix-yujiro-obama-che-guevara-anime-1850741340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baki the Grappler</em></a>’s<em> </em>Keisuke Itagaki, but her true claim to fame has nothing to do with her nepo baby status — it’s being the genius behind <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a> (AKA <a href="https://aftermath.site/zootopia-2-fan-comic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSFW <em>Zootopia</em></a>). At its core, <em>Beastars </em>is a bold exploration of class divides between carnivores and herbivores, gang violence, and the budding romance between a meek teenage wolf named Legoshi and a promiscuous white rabbit, Haru. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(animation_studio)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studio Orange</a>’s anime adaptation of <em>Beastars </em>first released on Netflix in 2020, it sparked a phenomenon in the anime community: much like people who hesitantly recommend <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> with warnings, <em>Beastars</em>' problem was that it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsBHll5wPg8&amp;list=PL792J1gNAYrQSZZKrlBbmjzZl3IZ-oxLm&amp;index=24&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too hot and uncomfortable to handle</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Watch/read <em>Beastars</em>, cowards&nbsp;</h2><p>In the climax of its second episode, <em>Beastars </em>confronted viewers with its stark approach to depicting sexuality, with Haru mistakenly assuming Legoshi meeting her in the shed on the roof of their campus was for sex. For many, this was an instant vibe check, sending the “I’m not a furry, bro” crowd for the hills and dismissing the show as the “furry porn fanservice” show. Like the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/never-give-up-digging-for-diamonds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digging for Diamonds meme</a>, folks quit too early, like cowards, before <em>Beastars </em>started cooking a deeply considered narrative about how the pair’s evolving relationship with sex, the implicit power dynamics between their species, and the broader taboo of interspecies romance reflected the sociological failings of their conservative society. By the final season, the series cemented itself as a provocative, well-crafted examination of these themes, proving there was far more at play than hetero (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULseevtGZH8&amp;list=PL792J1gNAYrQSZZKrlBbmjzZl3IZ-oxLm&amp;index=30&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and homoerotic</a>) anthropomorphic animals giving each other “come fuck me” eyes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hal &amp; Legoshi: Will They or Won't They?

She’s <a href="https://x.com/itaparu99/status/1794693889082962378/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny on social media</a>, has an <a href="https://x.com/itaparu99/status/1772585923462521257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-timer mangaka disguise</a>, and knows how to tackle big ideas without letting spicy stuff overpower themes. With <em>Ushimitsu Gao</em>, she’s leaning into the sexy stuff that scared the hoes with <em>Beastars</em>, writing a horror romance manga that’s equal parts sensual, thought-provoking, and most importantly, a mesmerizing read.</p><h2><em>Ushimitsu Gao</em> is Itagaki in her freaky Kate Chopin bag</h2><p><a href="https://championcross.jp/series/5371e74139496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ushimitsu Gao</em></a> (<em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em>) centers on Megumi Sano, a young housewife who’s always had a knack for seeing spirits. No matter where she goes, girly be seeing ghosts. Her unconventional trick to send them on their merry way is doing something lewd or obscene, because ghosts “dislike erotic stuff” — a fact I can’t help but think is a subliminal diss at folks who wrote off <em>Beastars</em>’ eroticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One night, while she and her exhausted salaryman husband, Yuji, are trying to conceive — an activity she describes as an unenthusiastic endeavor devoid of passion and climaxes for both parties — she spots a tall ghost Blair Witching in the corner of their bedroom while they make the beast with two backs. If the above sentence sounds like the most cursed thing you've read, that's because it is, and that's a part of the charm.</p><p>If you thought the premise would play out in a storyline where the ghost sits in the corner watching Megumi and Yuji make love, you’d be wrong. Yuji gets put in the proverbial accent chair, when Megumi’s efforts to have such fantastic sex with Yuji that it helps the dullahan pass on to the afterlife (or to exorcise him with salt) lead her to discover it's the unliving entity that’s turning her on. Her sensitivity to ghosts allows her to feel it place its salt-covered hand, too powerful to be exorcised, on her lips, and she responds in kind by sucking on his thumb. One morning, she even wakes up to Kinbaku rope marks on her skin after her resident ghost visits her in the night.</p><p>Megumi gives her paranormal service top a nickname, Ghost-kun, or Gou-kun (she almost nicknames him Yuurie or Yuu-san until she thinks better of it, as it sounds too close to her husband’s pet name, Yuu-kun) leaves spider lilies out for him, and covers her bedroom window with cardboard so they can get down during the day while her hubby is away, on top of the two having sex every night while her husband, who doesn’t believe in the paranormal, sleeps with his back to them getting it on.&nbsp;</p><p>Undoubtedly, this manga is freaky, and Itagaki is a real one. I kid you not, the moment Gou-kun's head fell off mid-sex, I joked to myself about how funny it would be if the manga made a joke about giving head. Itagaki immediately called my jest in a time-skip page-turn where Megumi casually mentioned her go-to kink request was for Gou-kun to do precisely that, while the rest of his body caresses her. The manga might only be a year old, but I spent a short evening getting caught up on it over the weekend, and I’m sat for more.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned up top, <em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em> isn’t just a smutty NTR manga. It also examines the unhealthy nature of the love triangle’s arrangement for all parties involved. Despite Megumi rightfully shaming a friend’s insistence that her affair is saving her marriage with an analogy about cheating wives that, like the hirugao flower, “come in bloom during the day, when the husband is away,” it later becomes the bedrock of her infidelity. To Megumi, her shacking up with Gou-kun is safe from scrutiny because he, in the technical sense, isn’t real. However, there are consequences to her affair: Every time they make love, Gou-kun is sapping the vitality out of Megumi, growing more handsome and less macabre (save for his protruding, Mileena-esque teeth poking out of his cheeks). To everyone else, her post-sex glow is her becoming more gaunt. Instead of taking that as a sign to stop cheating on her husband with a ghost, she takes it as a sign to eat more so she’ll have more energy left after their entanglement. The manga also doesn’t mince words by presenting their supernatural situation as anything other than Megumi cheating on Yuji.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned above, the story is more than just the sensationalism of its premise; it is brutally honest in its discussions about consent and includes a couple of chapters on certain reliable manga reading sites that provide content warnings. It doubles down by making matters all the more stark when body-snatching, signaled by Gou-kun code word “I will curse you,” comes into play. And Gou-kun is still being a homewrecker, declaring that Yuji and Megumi’s love is a thing of the past and that Yuji is neglecting Megumi’s feelings. While there’s some truth worth exploring in Gou-kun’s second point, the manga is also signaling that their outs are the awkward aftershock of the married couple being out of their honeymoon period.</p><p>Itagaki’s unflinching storytelling in both <em>Beastars </em>and <em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em> is a rare fascination in the world of manga, where sexuality is often boxed into empty fan service or sanitized detachment. She refuses to be confined by those limitations, instead opting to employ horror, romance, and infidelity as rich narrative tools for exploring the tangled realities of self-discovery and desire.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s almost a <em>The Awakening</em>-style unraveling in Megumi’s journey where her pursuit of sexual liberation sends her soaring, only for the reentry flames of consequence to send her careening back down to earth. It’s exciting to see a creator evoke Kate Chopin vibes while writing about ghost cuckoldry. But good art strives to craft a compelling narrative that challenges, unsettles, and excites in equal measure. I think Itagaki is a creative deep in her bag.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam"><h3>9 Kings: It’s A Good Video Game</h3></a><p>Play some cards, slaughter some guys</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There's reportedly a new dedicated gaming app from Apple planned for all of its devices--from iPhone to Apple TV--that the company looks to launch around Nintendo Switch 2's release on June 5. The app sounds like a mix of a store launcher to pick up games as well as a social hub to replace Game Center.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, this will be a major push from Apple to appeal to players and game developers. The app will apparently feature achievements, leaderboards, and social features. Additionally, the Mac version supposedly will include games bought and downloaded from other storefronts. Rumblings of a dedicated gaming app first appeared late last year at <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/" rel="nofollow ">9to5Mac</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">That's not all from Apple on the gaming front, either. Earlier this week, the company acquired Sneaky Sasquatch maker RAC7, per <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="nofollow ">Digital Trends</a>. The purchase of the two-person studio is reportedly the first time Apple has ever bought a gaming developer. Sneaky Sasquatch is one of the most popular games on the subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/#1">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The dedicated gaming app also comes almost five years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-fortnite-ban-and-apple-google-legal-battle-explained/1100-6480913/">Fortnite maker Epic took Apple (and Google) to court</a> over App Store policies that didn't allow for companies to get direct payment from users. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/">Fortnite finally returned to iOS</a> in the US just over a week ago after almost a half-decade off the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple has also spent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-ambitions/1100-6525131/">touting its gaming pedigree</a>, even stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-15-pro-is-best-game-console-apple-says/1100-6517793/">the iPhone 15 Pro was going to be the best gaming console</a> in 2023.

                <p>Video game retailer GameStop is a big believer in Bitcoin. The Grapevine, Texas-based company disclosed today, May 28, that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. At the current trading rates, that's worth more than $510 million USD.</p><p>Bitcoin is one of the world's most valuable, and volatile, assets. It's currently <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worth more than $2 trillion overall</a>, which is ahead of the total market cap of Google's parent company Alphabet. The current price for one Bitcoin is about $108,000.</p><p>GameStop's press release announcing the purchase of Bitcoin is <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/GameStop-Announces-Purchase-of-Bitcoin/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a single sentence long</a>, and there is no word on why GameStop did this or what its plans are. The announcement was not a surprise, though, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/gamestop-is-considering-investing-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-sources-say.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported in February</a> that GameStop was planning to buy cryptocurrencies. On May 27, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-bitcoin-stock-sale-c2db8214871452b88950bc10b567d1ec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated his desire to create a "Bitcoin treasury."</a></p><p>In any event, GameStop's share price is up around 10% so far in 2025 and up more than 3,000% since the short-squeeze situation of 2021. GameStop had cash reserves of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/gamestop-shares-rise-as-retailer-meme-stock-buys-first-bitcoin-batch-scooping-up-500-million.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $4.5 billion as of February 2025</a>, according to the company's latest filings.</p><p>Buying Bitcoin is GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen's latest strategy to help the struggling company turn things around; other measures have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-makes-a-surprise-profit-warns-of-impending-store-closures/1100-6526415/" data-ref-id="1100-6526415">layoffs, store closures, and selling Game Informer.</a></p><p>Cohen has the power to do this in part because GameStop's board voted in December 2023 to allow Cohen and two other board members to use GameStop's cash pile to purchase securities as part of a new <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250404496/gamestops-stock-is-climbing-again-this-is-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"investment policy."</a></p><p>GameStop previously invested in NFTs and created its own cryptocurrency wallet, but the company shuttered this in January 2024.</p>

After ambling through a brief demo that showcased the upcoming sojourn in all of its whimsical, offbeat glory, I parked myself next to Takahashi to learn more about his process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before I could fire up the recording app on my iPhone, however, Takahashi asked whether he might inspect the handset. The device, what I assumed was a run-of-the-mill iPhone 15 with a yellow colorway, piqued his interest because of its apparently ambiguous hue. We spent the next few minutes debating what constituted 'yellow' and whether this particular morsel of technology was in fact more of a 'banana' shade. We eventually agreed on the latter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a small exchange that quickly told me two things: this would not be a straightforward interview, and this is a person who—despite spending decades making video games—remains unapologetically curious. Over the next 25 minutes we spoke at length about everything from production processes to the need for a creative revolution in the niche field of playground design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dredge-wasn-t-originally-going-to-be-a-narrative-game-but-then-it-became-one-of-2023-s-best" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dredge wasn't originally going to be a narrative game, but then it became one of 2023's best</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here's everything I learned during that wonderfully winding conversation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To a T wasn't immune to scoping issues">To a T wasn't immune to scoping issues</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Takahashi tells me the idea for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To a T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which tells the story of a 'Teen' stuck in a T-pose who must attempt to navigate life in a small town with the help of a fluffy companion, came to him fairly quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, it took longer than expected to turn the concept into something viable. He explains the development team (Takahashi now works at a studio called Uvula) initially thought they could finish </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To a T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in around two years. In the end, the project was in the oven for five.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although production took longer than anticipated, the nucleus remained unchanged. "It's sort of a sitcom," explains Takahashi, who says he storyboarded the beginning of the game in order to consolidate and communicate his vision for the project. Following our chat, Takahashi sent over some of those storyboards, which you can see below.</span></p><p>To a T storyboards via Keita Takahashi</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">12 people worked on the title when production was in full swing, but the size of the team fluctuated over the years. It was important, says Takahashi, to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses during that time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, he explains they generally tried to avoid incorporating physics because they can be "so tough and difficult."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-star-wars-outlaws-poker-style-mini-game-helped-to-define-its-tone" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Star Wars Outlaws' poker-style mini-game helped to define its tone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just use physics for the VFX and stuff like that," he says. He notes the narrative has always been the glue that binds the experience together. "I thought of the story and then tried to think about what kind of mini-games would fit," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those mini-games will see players attempt to help Teen brush their teeth, choose their outfit, and chomp down some cereal to understand how seemingly mundane actions can become notable hurdles when you exist outside the perceived norms of society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all of its whimsy and barmy charm, the demo was also a sensitive and affecting look at what life is like when the "little things" are hard and what it means to be the "perfect shape." There was also a singing Giraffe who is besotted by sandwiches. Tremendous.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Being a game developer is so risky&quot;">"Being a game developer is so risky"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As our conversation turns to how the industry at large has changed over the past five years—with a short-lived COVID-19 boom and subsequent over-investment eventually leading to mass layoffs, studio closures, and debilitating funding challenges—I ask Takahashi what he gleaned during that time and whether he has any advice for developers looking to bring their own unique vision to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, he's reluctant to whisper any sage words. "I'm still too young to offer wisdom," he says. The fear is that he might unintentionally offer bad advice. "I'm the worst, dude," he continues, with a laugh. He does, however, suggest the game industry has always been fraught with danger.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-comedy-first-approach-to-thank-goodness-you-re-here" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We write good stuff in the pub:' the comedy first approach to Thank Goodness You're Here</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This not only in 2025—I think being a developer is so risky," he says. "Especially being a game designer. Engineers and artists might be fine, because at least they have a skill. But being a game designer, it's very unclear [what they do]. What is a game? I don't know."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?si=9kkdP36dSol94cDI" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite intimating he's unsure what constitutes a video game after releasing multiple acclaimed titles, Takahashi eventually hones in on a single word: "interactivity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond that, he feels the industry has become too prescriptive. An innate focus on placing video games into categories and genres—adventure, shooter, RPG, battle royale—has, in the words of Takahashi, convinced people to "keep following that direction without thinking."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I ask whether that means the industry—and particularly those in the executive suites—should unlearn everything they think they know about what constitutes success. "There might be a good chance," he replies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He posits that business leaders should serve developers—not the other way around. The recent generative AI gold rush, he suggests, is a perfect example of that imbalance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't care whether [those tools] are creative or not," he says. "I hate that they're just doing that for the business' sake. Nobody said 'please make them,' but everyone is asking for them to make the [work] environment better. [But the big companies] just keep making what they want, which is money."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Takahashi says building a playground remains the &quot;dream&quot;">Takahashi says building a playground remains the "dream"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's evident Takahashi has an unshakable belief that creativity is about eschewing norms in favor of the unknown.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wonder whether that seemingly innate instinct to dismantle expectation feeds back into his long-held desire to design and construct a real-life playground—as he revealed to an audience at the (now-defunct) GameCity conference in Nottingham back in 2005.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Takahashi tells me that designing a park is still his "dream." As for whether there's any overlap between that mission and his game design instincts, he explains that in his mind "the virtual and the physical is kind of the same."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I also know they're different," he quickly adds with a smile, as if to reassure me that he isn't having an existential meltdown. Internally I breathe a sign of relief.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We press on. Takahashi continues dissecting his vision for the new-age playground. He tells me he views most instances of the time-old recreational area as overplayed and dull.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I feel it's a wasted idea," he continues. "When I see the current playground equipment—it's boring. It's designed only for the child. The parents are just sitting on the bench and looking at their smartphone, or talking with the other parents. It's not designed for the adult."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's hard to argue. See-saws. Swings. Roundabouts. Slides. All tried, tested, and decidedly tired. There has been a notable lack of innovation in this field for decades. Playgrounds have become stagnant. I ask Takahashi how he would innovate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His answer is one that might give health-and-safety inspectors sleepless nights: "risk."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, with that one word, I wonder if perhaps Takahashi has also surmised what is becoming increasingly absent from the game industry—particularly within the biggest studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fast-following can only breed imitation, and when ideas such as originality and creative risk become novel, you have to wonder whether someone like Takahashi would have even been able to break into the industry if they were a newcomer today. Thankfully, in this instance, that thought remains completely hypothetical.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

		<p>Redemption Road’s barmy time-travelling medieval war game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> is set to hit Steam Early Access on 8th October 2025. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, uh, what’s going on there, then? Well, the future is about to crumble into an apocalypse, but there’s thankfully a chance to set things right by bouncing back in time 500 years and turning the tide of a brutal medieval war in England. You’ve got to change history, and since the chances of a time traveller just dying from stepping on a rusty nail and not having a tetanus shot are pretty much astronomical, you need to stack the odds in your favour by bringing some modern day toys with you.</p>
<p>Yup, that means running around with fully automatic assault rifles, RPGs, hopping onto motorbikes and into tanks that can just drive through stuff. With all of this at hand, you have a much better chance, but one man with a machine gun isn’t going to survive an enemy army, even if they are running at you with swords. So you can build cities and castles, recruit soldiers to your cause and raise armies to conquer the rest of the country, blending in RTS action with the third person battling.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can bring some friends with you too with support for up to 4 player co-op.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">announced back at Day of the Devs last June</a>, Kingmakers was then expected for a Q1 2025 early access release, but has naturally slipped back a fair bit to October. There’s real potential here to be that silly online co-op hit, though, so hopefully it arrives in good shape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/mindseye-gets-an-explainer-trailer-just-two-weeks-before-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Build A Rocket Boy and IOI Partners have released a big new explainer trailer for MindsEye, their ambitious open world shooter and user-generated content <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/mindseye-is-launching-in-everywhere-but-what-does-that-mean/">Everywhere</a> platform that is set to launch on 10th June for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of MindsEye takes place in Redrock City, a near future metropolis in which humans and machines battle for power and control, which is shown through the power struggle between Mayor Shiva Vega and tech genius Marco Silva, who is also the founder of the technology firm Silva Industries. Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his own past.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off plenty of cinematics from the story, missions that even take you up to space, and a whole bunch of third person shooter combat. In these segments, you’ll have plenty of conventional guns to choose from, but also have an AI drone buddy that can do area recon and stun enemies, hack evil I, Robot movie robots to fight alongside you and more.</p>
<p>It’s brought together by in-game “portals” branded Play.Mindseye to access moments from the official story and the open world, as well as hop into the “infinite entertainment” of user-generated missions through the PC-based Build.Mindseye tools. It’s a full-blown level and mission editor, providing the platform for people to make their own games. This is a part of the Everywhere platform, as mentioned above, a counterpart and rival to Fortnite’s UGC tools, and more presciently, to GTA 5 and the upcoming GTA 6.</p>

<p>At launch the game will have the single player content in free roam, as well as separate races, checkpoint races, and drone races. This will expand through content updates to add more missions, multiplayer (in the autumn), community updates and “special collaborations”. More will be added for those buying the premium edition of the game.</p>

<p>For such an ambitious title, it’s perhaps surprising that the marketing hasn’t been more intense. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">first revealed in February</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/mindseye-release-date-set-for-june-10th/">release date was only announced in March</a>, but this production is clearly setting its sights on Grand Theft Auto Online’s audience. That’s hardly surprisingly when the team was founded by Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar and producer on pretty much everything from GTA 3 through to GTA 5.</p>
<p>The run up to launch has also been quite restrained in terms of only granting preview to a select few YouTubers, from what we can see, and with no coverage from major gaming sites. Impressions were… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">less</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKKAMa6sXxE">than</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhWeYRoZl4E">favourable</a>. These previews were live, but remote and hands off, limiting the potential for appraisal.</p>
<p>So, uh… yeah, 10th June’s going to be interesting and we’re keen to go hands on for ourselves.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Elden Ring Nightreign</h5><p><span>May 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>The announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">last year</a> was a surprise for most players. Following the release of what has become FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">most celebrated action RPG</a> to date and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">expansion</a>, it has been reiterated multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-2-development/">a sequel</a> was not in development, suggesting that it would be a while until Tarnished could return to the Lands Between, counting teased IP expansions that most thought were a few years away. The doors of the Roundtable Hold, however, could not stay shut for long, and the iconic location is about to be opened up to welcome the Nighfarers and aid them in their difficult battle against the Nightlords to repel the Night Tide and possibly restore the fractured reality of Limveld to the former splendor of its older days.</p>
<p>While every entry in the Souls series featured a multiplayer component, the co-op nature of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, and its extremely close resemblance to the original game, made more than a few players skeptical at the game's reveal. FromSoftware's games are known for their relatively slow pace that allows players to meticulously explore big, intricately designed locations, study enemy patterns, and develop their character build to be able to overcome the many challenges they have to face. I shared this skepticism myself.</p>
<p>While I could see the gameplay formula lend itself to a roguelike spin, the focus on co-op felt, on paper, maybe a little forced, considering the studio never implemented proper co-op in their games, allowing it only for short segments. Playing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">Closed Network Test</a>, my opinion of the game changed for the better, and spending 30+ hours with the launch version made me realize how wrong I was. Though some things could be improved, Elden Ring Nightreign shows once again why FromSoftware is the best at what they do, tweaking their formula slightly to make it work as an engaging high-speed co-op experience where individual player knowledge and skill still matter a lot.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520000241_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though Limveld looks very similar to The Lands Between's Limgrave region, Elden Ring Nightreign's setting is very different from that of the base game. This new region is a parallel version of Limgrave, created after the cataclysmic event called the Shattering. Being a fractured version of the first regions players explore in Elden Ring isn't the only thing that makes Limveld dangerous, as the Night Tide besieges the land, reshaping it each night ahead of the coming of the Nightlord, a being linked with the ancient Nox civilization, who were known worshippers of the night even after they were forced into exile in The Lands Between. The only warriors capable of surviving the Night Tide and taking on the Nightlord and its hordes are the Nightfarers. Defined by their combat abilities, but with their own personal stories and motivations, the eight warriors - Wylder, Guardian, Duchess, Ironeye, Raider, Recluse, Revenant and Executor - often embark on Expeditions in Limveld from the Roundtable Hold base to fight off these hordes, defeat the powerful Nightlords, and discover the truth behind the mysterious being behind it all.</p>
<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, Elden Ring Nightreign features plenty of story, but it's up to players to put the pieces together. Instead of featuring the same envrionmental storytelling of every Souls game, which would have been difficult to implement in a fast paced game like this, the game's story is developed using character profiles that are accessed in the Roundtable Hold, as well as with Nightfarers' individual quests part of the Remembrance mechanics that require players to complete certain tasks while on an Expedition. New story elements are introduced and developed after a few Expeditions, in the vein of story-heavy roguelikes like Hades or Returnal, so even a failed Expedition rewards players for their effort beyond giving them Relics and Murk, central elements of the permanent progression system featured in the game.</p>

<p>On the surface, Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't feel any different from the base game, only featuring a considerably smaller but denser map filled with locations to explore, which hide all sorts of enemies but also weapons and upgrades. It also plays almost exactly like it, down to the weapon's moveset and balance, reminiscent of the first few versions of the game. If one were to pick the Wylder, for example, there almost wouldn't be any difference from playing any player-created character from the original game, and, as such, the game can instantly feel familiar to those who have already spent time in The Lands Between. Everything else surrounding the most basic Elden Ring mechanics, however, is completely different. As the land of Limveld is besieged by the Nightlords, which, unsurprisingly, only come out at night, there's a time limit for exploring Limveld. Each game consists of three days, the first two lasting around 15 minutes, and the final comprising only the boss fight against one of the seven Nightlords. As time passes, the Night approaches, and the playable area becomes smaller in the first two days, eventually forcing the Nightfarers to convene in a certain spot on the map to take on a powerful boss, often a familiar face lifted straight from Elden Ring or the Dark Souls games. Defeating any boss in Limveld will reward Nightfarers with more runes needed to level up and one of three passive upgrades to help them better define the builds they have started putting together on the fly during the current Expedition.</p>
<p>Doing things as quickly as possible is the name of the game in Elden Ring Nightreign. With the Night constantly threatening to engulf certain parts of Limveld, Nightfares have to come up with a plan rather quickly, prioritizing where to go and which upgrades to get depending on the their position, the areas that will potentially become inaccessible as the Night Tide closes in, and the affinity of the Nightlord they are hunting. As the position of almost every location on the map is randomized at the start of an Expedition, knowing the layout of the map will not, by itself, be enough to level up, enhance the more than important than ever Flask with additional charges, and upgrade characters enough to survive the Night. After defeating the first Nightlord, Gladius, Shifting Earth events will be unlocked, special events that significantly alter the basic Limveld map to provide some welcome variety, and with World Events and Raids thrown in randomly, which can even cause Nightlords to appear before Day 3, Nightfarers can never rest easy.</p>
<p>With no time to waste, it's not surprising to see how character progression in Elden Ring Nightreign has been considerably streamlined, as, upon level up, stats are upgraded automatically depending on the Nightfarer. This doesn't mean that the immense number of character build options available in the original game are gone. The contrary, actually: there are so many options that everything feels almost overwhelming during the first couple of Expeditions. Every weapon in the game, which can be obtained by opening up treasure chests, raiding enemy camps, and defeating bosses, comes in different rarity levels and with different passive skills, the vast majority of which are active just by having the weapon in your inventory.</p>
<p>These passive skills empower all sorts of builds, allowing players to recreate the devastating bleed builds seen in Elden Ring's first few versions, elemental builds, tanky builds with increased poise and damage negation, critical hit builds that work great with characters that have an easy time opening enemies to them, like the parry-focused Executor, and so on. Further defining builds are the Relics, special items representing the game's permanent progression system, coming with passive skills that can be equipped to any character before the start of any Expedition, which can make a huge difference in a variety of situations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250526003628_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Adding more depth to the experience are the eight Nightfarers, who all play very differently from one another. The already mentioned Wylder is the most balanced of them, offering a balanced mix between offense and defense that can work in every situation, but every other Nightfarer is more specialized, offering a different gameplay style, such as the ranged-focused playstyle of Ironeye, the traditional tank with great supportive skills like Guardian, the magic oriented Recluse, the frontline fighter Raider, the quick Duchess, the spirit summoner Revenant and the parry-focused Executor. Each character's uniqueness is well-defined not only by the ability to use certain weapons effectively with enhanced movesets, but also by their unique Passive Ability, Character Skill, and Ultimate Art, which generally have a few uses besides damaging an enemy.</p>
<p>For example, the Ironeyes' Single Shot Ultimate Art can knock down the vast majority of foes and quickly revive downed companions, who usually have to be hit multiple times with regular attacks to return to life. After playing Elden Ring for hundreds of hours, this character system feels a little off, but thankfully it doesn't take a long time for it to shine, as it makes a lot of sense given the game's co-op focus, which is the feature that mostly defines the entire experience, and, most of all, makes it a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign can be either played solo or with two other players, but it's clear how the experience has been designed for co-op first and foremost. Elements like the time limit, the huge enemy numbers, which comprise the vast majority of enemies seen in Elden Ring, and their high HP values clearly indicate how Elden Ring Nightreign has to be played with friends. In solo mode, only the HP values are tweaked, so having to deal with a huge number of enemies is a challenge that only the best will be able to overcome. In the thirty-plus hours I spent with the game, I only managed to get to the Nightlord fight a handful of times playing solo, and most of the time, it was more frustrating than fun. Playing with others, no matter their knowledge of the game's mechanics, on the other hand, was always tons of fun.</p>
<p>While using voice chat to communicate and set up strategies consistently led to the most victories, even just using the in-game pin system, which allows players to indicate where they want to go to the other Nightfarers on the map, works reasonably well, and is a completely viable way of handling the war against the Night and its hordes. With other players by your side, the culmination of each Expedition, the fight against one of the Nightlords, becomes even more epic and memorable. It also helps that these bosses are among the best FromSoftware has designed to date. Each Nightlord has a distinct combat design that makes fighting them a joy, although they can be quite challenging, with unrelenting movesets that leave very few openings. For some, this will be a frustrating issue, but for others, their incredible power will only make the fights more epic, coupled with the fantastic soundtrack.</p>
<p>With online co-op being the focus of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign provides players with plenty of options to enjoy the game with others. Besides allowing regular matchmaking, the game also offers the chance to put together squads by inviting users from the friend list or setting up passwords to join a game. The password system can also be used to allow a certain number of users to more frequently encounter the remnants of their defeated friends, giving them the chance to obtain their dropped equipment or see the manner of their defeat. Unfortunately, the game does not feature cross-platform play, which feels like a baffling omission. The lack of duos matchmaking also feels like an oversight, which is probably justified by balancing reasons, as it would really take too long to take down the Nightlords with just two players with the current HP values, although the developer is thinking about implementing a two-player mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">down the line.</a></p>

<p>Using a good portion of the assets seen in the original game, Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't look much different from the 2022 Game of the Year, although visuals have been clearly touched up slightly, and present a high level of polish with little to no visual glitches and some beautiful skyboxes that well deliver the oppressive atmosphere of Limveld and the impending arrival of the Night. Character models are also, for the most part, lifted from Elden Ring and from the Dark Souls games, but those that aren't, like the models for new bosses, look great and contribute to better separating the co-op game from its predecessor and to making it more engaging.</p>

<p>Speaking specifically about the PC version of the game, in proper FromSoftware fashion, the game has a 60 FPS cap, so a high refresh rate experience is not possible, at least at launch. Though the game comes with a limited selection of graphics settings to tweak, and doesn't support any major upscaler (NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS), Elden Ring Nightreign seems to fare much better than the original Elden Ring in terms of performance. In a benchmark session comprising two in-game days on the base Limveld map without any Shifting Earth events, the game ran at 4K resolution, max settings an average of 59 FPS, 45 FPS 1% low on my machine (I7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), with no major stuttering, so the slight drops weren't an issue whatsoever. In addition, online play works great in all manner of situations and with all sorts of connections. Due to an issue with my internet connection, I temporarily could only play the game online via a mobile hotspot, and experienced no trouble whatsoever matchmaking with other players and enjoying full sessions, so, if the servers manage to keep up with the expected influx of players in its launch window, I expect online play to perform great for the vast majority of players.</p>

<p data-start="211" data-end="684">Elden Ring: Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Golbez, Crystal Collector</h2>
