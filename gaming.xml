While this means there will be no further seasons, the game’s servers will remain online, and there will be some in-game “<em>Foamstars</em> Cup” competitions that continue after that point. </p><p>“Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy <em>Foamstars</em>, previous Season Passes will be made available again,” the post reads. “Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p><p><em>Foamstars</em>, which revolves around augmenting battlefields with color-coded, elevation-changing foam and “chilling” your enemies, released to little fanfare back in February. Despite debuting as a free PS Plus game, the otherwise $30 live-service shooter missed the two-week honeymoon period multiplayer games tend to get on console, and never managed to recover. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/foamstars-free-to-play-square-enix-october-ps5-ps4-pc-1851632964#:~:text=On%20August%2027%2C%20Square%20Enix,be%20free%20later%20this%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-free-to-play-square-enix-october-ps5-ps4-pc-1851632964#:~:text=On%20August%2027%2C%20Square%20Enix,be%20free%20later%20this%20year."><em>Foamstars</em> went free-to-play</a></span> in October, but that doesn’t seem to have moved the needle much. </p><p>It probably didn’t help that the game was a PS4 and PS5 exclusive and unavailable on Xbox and PC.

Sony had intended to team up with Nintendo on a disc-based, next-gen successor to the SNES. Then the Mario maker decided to stick with cartridges at the last minute, completely changing the console gaming timeline in the process. A new machine was born, one that gave us some of our favorite games ever made. That was thirty years ago, and now it’s clear that it changed video game history forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-recommend-id="image://cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Crash appears in his first game.

Thankfully, his game was a fantastic platformer that mixed up the camera angle and pace to deliver bite-sized levels that were distinct, memorable, and fun to replay over and over again. And I did—a lot. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="97606ea2e30fd8875a5abb90307b5787" data-recommend-id="image://97606ea2e30fd8875a5abb90307b5787" data-format="png" data-width="1106" data-height="621" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Police jump out of the way on Christmas Eve.

This single disc was bursting with arcade action, containing fully realized video game adaptations of all three (at the time, the only three) <em>Die Hard </em>movies, each one completely different from the others. The first is a third-person shooter that has you gunning down hordes of terrorists as you navigate Nakitomi Plaza, while the second is an on-rails, first-person shooter that sees you blast your way through Dulles Airport and beyond before a ludicrous final sequence takes you to the skies in a helicopter, from which you shoot terrorists off the wings of an in-flight 747 before bringing the whole evil airplane down. It’s surprising, stupendous, and so uniquely <em>video games</em>.</p><p>The one I remember the most, though, is <em>Die Hard With a Vengeance</em>, an absolutely crazed driving game in which you barrel down the streets and around the parks of New York City. Drawn into a terrorist’s twisted game, you must intercept cars that have been rigged with bombs and prevent them from exploding, which, of course, you do by crashing into them repeatedly, <em>Chase HQ</em>-style. You get an assortment of camera options here, one of which is a first-person, in-the-car view. Hit pedestrians in this perspective and your windshield might get momentarily splattered with blood, quickly washed away by your windshield wipers. It’s all very ‘90s edgy and extreme. <em>With a Vengeance</em>, while pretty simple and limited, is possessed of the kind of kinetic energy that would later make games like <em>Burnout 3 </em>so exhilarating, and <em>Die Hard Trilogy </em>as a whole crackles with a balls-to-the-wall enthusiasm that made it a defining release of the early PlayStation era.—Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-recommend-id="image://4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man with giant wheels for hands battles in Paris.

Blow up the Eiffel Tower! Send your opponents plummeting from precarious New York City rooftops! Like so much of the PS1’s library, <em>Twisted Metal 2 </em>had a go-for-broke quality that seemed to shatter the old ideas about what gaming could or should do, and it was a thrill to be along for the ride. – Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c59bb52367b5a099318b67ad1ce68c4b" data-recommend-id="image://c59bb52367b5a099318b67ad1ce68c4b" data-format="png" data-width="1021" data-height="575" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman stands behind an airship.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Final Fantasy VII </em>is, deservedly, one of the most analyzed and celebrated games of all time, so there’s no insight I can offer into its greatness—especially in a relatively brief slideshow blurb—that hasn’t already been made a thousand times over. Instead, I’ll relay a memory. During my senior year of college, some friends and I had a borrowed PlayStation in the apartment we were sharing, much to the detriment of our studies, and the discovery of that game’s world, the struggles of its characters, and the monumental achievement of its design became part of the fabric of that year for us.</p><p>I’d been playing games my whole life, but in so many ways, <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>was like nothing I’d ever played before–so grandiose, so thematically complex, so audacious and spectacular. I’ll never forget one of my roommates coming back from class one afternoon, tossing his backpack down on the ground and shouting, “Gold chocobo!” before recommitting himself to the grind for the precious bird. We knew the world of <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>still held secrets we hadn’t yet attained, and we wanted to explore it for all its mysteries before venturing to that fateful final confrontation with Sephiroth. In the decades since, so many games have given us worlds that are more vast, more graphically detailed, more packed with time-wasting “content,” but I don’t know that there’s ever been a world that was more memorable and astounding, or that has served as the setting for a more epic and unforgettable tale. – Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-recommend-id="image://3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-format="png" data-width="1266" data-height="712" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mega Man and Roll run away from sky pirates.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What <em>Ocarina of Time</em> was for<em> Zelda</em>, <em>Mega Man Legends </em>was for the blue bomber. It ditched 2D levels for an expansive, Saturday-morning-cartoon-esque world full of sprawling underground dungeons hiding powerful gear and dark secrets. I still remember the first time I went down a hatch, creeped around a corner, and immediately got skewered by a dual-drill-armed Sharukurusu. It was my first taste of open-world exploration and massive sandbox battles. Everything in this game was firing on all cylinders and it’s a travesty we never got <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-recommend-id="image://9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="623" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abe walks along industrial scaffolding.

I wasn’t even 10 years old when I first saw Abe get gunned down outside a totalitarian industrial complex for getting on the wrong side of management and messing up a puzzle. The 2D adventure game had immaculately grim vibes with just enough cheeky, gallows humor to keep it from feeling entirely overbearing. The sequel spin-off had more depth and polish, but it still didn’t come close to the visceral gut punch of the first game. The opening FMV remains seared into my memory, and the late-game mechanical twist is an all-time great one. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-recommend-id="image://7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-format="png" data-width="986" data-height="555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Parappa raps.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Parappa the Rapper </em>is not only one of the best PlayStation games; it’s also one of the <em>most </em>PlayStation games. By that, I mean it’s emblematic of the spirit of the original PlayStation, a spirit of playful innovation and experimentation that sought to produce new kinds of home console games and to create new kinds of fun and memorable experiences. <em>Parappa </em>proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that tapping buttons on a controller in rhythm with a song could be great fun, and that concept would go on to power some of the biggest games of the decade to come. And yet, it all could have failed if <em>Parappa </em>itself hadn’t been so great–so creatively distinctive, so vibrant, so packed with unforgettable songs. Thankfully, however, within a few minutes of starting the game, an anthropomorphic onion is teaching you to rap and do martial arts with the words, “Kick, punch, it’s all in the mind!” and it’s all so wild and surreal and committed to its own vision that you know, immediately, you are never gonna forget it. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-recommend-id="image://6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dracula and other characters from Symphony of the Night appear in official art work.

When <em>Symphony of the Night </em>arrived on the scene in 1997, however, it made a very strong impression, in some ways redefining our collective notions of what was possible in the genre of 2D action games. Going in without pre-defined expectations, many players of the time–myself included–found ourselves absolutely astounded by the game’s richness and depth. Just when we thought the castle couldn’t possibly have more to give, we’d find our exploration rewarded yet again with still more areas, secrets, and bosses. For my money, the game’s second half may represent the single biggest surprise in all of gaming, a secret the likes of which may never be topped. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-recommend-id="image://1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lara Croft shoots a Gatling gun.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The follow-up to Lara Croft’s inaugural adventure is, in some ways, a diabolical and infuriating game–I think part of me will be forever trapped in its notorious Venetian opera house level. The incredible intricacy of its environments, however, is also part of what makes it so memorable. <em>Tomb Raider 2 </em>proved that Lara Croft was no mere one-hit wonder, no fleeting sensation rocketed to short-lived stardom merely because of her sex appeal. With the success of this game, her status as an icon was cemented, and at the time, no other figure represented the new, PlayStation-powered era that video games were entering quite like she did. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-recommend-id="image://da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-format="png" data-width="1064" data-height="599" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites appear on a bridge in battle.

While <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>examined corporate exploitation and militarism, <em>Tactics</em> interrogated political power and religious dogma.

Taking place in New York City in the final days of 1997, the game whisks you from elegant operas to hushed museums to grimy city streets while you–as NYPD officer Aya Brea–work to thwart a horrifying threat to the Big Apple’s population.

Still, I think plenty of PlayStation owners were keenly aware, by 1999, that the system didn’t really have anything that could compete with <em>Mario Kart</em>. That all changed with the arrival of <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, a kart racer so good, some justifiably felt it beat Nintendo’s series<em> </em>at its own game. <em>CTR</em>’s visuals were vibrant and appealing, the racing was thrilling, the tracks were brilliantly designed and had terrific shortcuts–it had all the pick-up-and-play fun of a kart racer along with the high skill ceiling genre enthusiasts crave. To top it all off, its Adventure Mode, which has you racing against bosses, unlocking new stages and making story progress, was the most elaborate and exciting single-player mode ever offered in a kart racer at the time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-recommend-id="image://18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-format="png" data-width="892" data-height="501" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rinoa, Squall, and Seifer stand in a field of flowers.

And I don’t think any conversation about the impact of the original PlayStation is complete without it.</p><p><em>FFVIII</em> arguably endures in the hearts of its fans for many reasons: It’s a moving coming-of-age story set in a strange, hard-to-comprehend world. Its off-beat RPG mechanics are capable of being entertainingly exploited and utterly broken. The game features a rich, hybrid sci-fi/fantasy world with numerous cities and settlements to explore as you piece together its strange, time-bending narratives about moody teenagers shouldered with the burdens of protecting the world and each other. It didn’t land with everyone. But those of us for whom it did are still thinking about it nearly 30 years later.</p><p>I would argue that <em>FFVIII</em>’s dark horse status, however, is part of its character. While other <em>FF</em> games receive endless celebration and expensive remakes, the joy of <em>FFVIII</em>’s greatness is a sort of “if you know, you know” status for fans. In the last 30 years, I’d argue that the PlayStation brand has been home to many such experiences (fans of lesser-celebrated PlayStation titles like <em>Heavenly Sword</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em> know what I’m talking about). <em>FFVIII</em>, to me, is one of the best early examples of that: Owning a PlayStation meant you could enjoy landmark titles while also finding some genuine hidden gems in its vast library. — Claire Jackson </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-recommend-id="image://7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-format="png" data-width="1028" data-height="577" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A car races down a track.

It might not look realistic, but <em>GT’</em>s polygonal cars and wobbly roads still get the job done and remind me of a time when racing games weren’t live-service monsters.

But even setting that aside, I was enthralled at a young age by its melodrama. Walking through the village I’d been running around all game after its citizens had been turned to stone was terrifying and has been etched in my brain for decades.

It’s horrible and hilarious every time. <em>Syphon Filter</em> might not be a franchise people talk about much in 2024, but that original game on PlayStation spent a lot of time in my console because it offered up a fun, tense, and action-packed modern-day shooter about secret agents, deadly viruses, and government corruption. And also, that cool taser thing I mentioned earlier. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-recommend-id="image://d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-format="png" data-width="1261" data-height="709" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A kid goes to a Digimon store.

The first was more evocative of <em>Digimon</em>’s digital pet roots, weaving raising a ‘mon from its baby form into a powerful monster capable of taking on some of the bigger threats you have to face. But it could also be frustratingly tedious, as your partner would go through multiple cycles of life, dying and being reborn as a baby you had to once again raise to the point of usefulness before moving forward. The sequels had their own progress-gating but felt much less arbitrary, and had interesting twists on the <em>Digimon</em> universe that kept them fresh. Would love to see a collection on modern platforms, Bandai Namco. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-recommend-id="image://f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dart and his friends fly toward danger.

The Sony-developed RPG took aim at <em>Final Fantasy</em> and missed, but not by much. The pre-rendered backgrounds were magnificent, the music was beautiful, and the mythological stakes helped me look past the ugly enemy designs and incredibly grindy random encounters. I loved it so much, I beat the whole thing and then watched my cousins play it again on an old TV in the basement that had no sound. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-recommend-id="image://f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-format="png" data-width="1013" data-height="629" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man punches a super villain.

At the time, however, it exploded onto the scene as one of the best superhero games ever made. It nailed the appeal of Spidey–his wisecracks, his decency, his abilities–and swept you up in a breathless adventure that had you swinging from New York City skyscrapers, battling supervillains on top of speeding subway trains, and tackling all kinds of other superhero setpieces. If you ask me, the lineage of great 3D Spider-games that’s still going today all started right here with this incredible achievement. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-recommend-id="image://c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-format="png" data-width="845" data-height="475" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tony Hawk appears beside his avatar.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The original <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> is amazing. But <em>THPS2</em> is the better game, boasting the same snappy and responsive 3D skateboarding as its predecessor, but with new features and tricks. <em>THPS2</em> added manuals, letting you combo more tricks together to reach higher scores. It also included create-a-skater and create-a-park, letting younger me spend way too many hours tinkering with the game. Really, the only reason I stopped playing <em>THPS2</em> was to play <em>THPS3</em> on PS2. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-recommend-id="image://4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="621" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashely faces down a wyvern.

If I’d wanted that I would have played <em>Resident Evil</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and I very much did not. But I stuck with it and quickly realized I’d actually discovered one of the best games—still to this day—ever made. The writing is brilliant, the atmospheric dungeon crawling is clever and elegant, and the hybrid turn-based action combat is surprising and satisfying. It only had one problem, and that was the awful damage formulas that rendered all attacks useless unless you spent a ton of time grinding against particular enemy types or mastering its baroque blacksmithing system. But I persevered through the single-digit strikes against enemies and one-hit spells from bosses because the medieval noir thriller at <em>Vagrant Story</em>’s core is second to none.—Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher Netease have revealed more details about the upcoming free-to-play gacha game Anata, which was formerly known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-mugen/" data-ref-id="5000-600379">Project Mugen</a>. In a brand-new teaser--that looks like an homage to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">first GTA 6 trailer</a>--the company showed off some of the gameplay for Ananta, where players will patrol the streets of Nova City as an agent of the Anti-Chaos Directorate.</p><p>Similar to other gacha games like Zenless Zone Zero, Ananta has an anime-inspired design, and Naked Science says that players will get to explore an "open-world urban RPG" where they take on the forces of Chaos.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n26InrperQE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n26InrperQE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Nova City has plunged into Chaos, from spooky paranormal phenomena to toilets racing through traffic in the streets, the game promises to offer a unique blend of humor, adventure, and mystery," the official description for Ananta reads.</p><p>As seen in the trailer above, it looks like there'll be some bizarre enemies to face off against, like sentient toilet armies, cars armed with chainsaw arms, and other forms of weirdness plaguing Nova City. You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.</p><p>When it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is pulling the metaphorical season plug on its soapy shooter Foamstars next month, less than a year after its release.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the company announced its next season - known somewhat ironically as Party Goes On - will be its last, though it will remain online and isn't shutting down completely.</p>
<p>Foamstars' Party Goes On season will kick off on 13th December, and run until 17th January. After that, season updates for Foamstars will come to an end, and no new content will be added to the game.</p>

<p>"In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future," Square Enix wrote.</p><p>Foamstars' previous season passes will be made available once again, for those players who may have missed them previously. Square Enix noted there will be the option for players to switch between passes and choose the season pass track of their choice. "This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season," it explained.</p>
<p>Those who want to go for the Premium Pass will need to pay, as before. The basic pass is free.</p>

<p>In a letter from producer <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/foamstars-letter-producer-5-dec-2024">Kosuke Okatani</a>, the developer thanked those who have played and will continue to play Foamstars.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to sound like a final message since you will be able to continue playing the game. However I wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you all once again, so I've taken up my pen to write this producer's letter," Okatani wrote.</p>
<p>"Since the game's release on February 6, 2024, the development team has been working tirelessly to add new content and features, striving to bring the game as close as possible to that goal.</p>
<p>"Throughout both the development and operational phases, we have faced many challenges. However, the support of all of you who play the game, along with the incredible fan art, has been a constant source of encouragement for the team. It's because of this support that we've been able to overcome these difficulties, always with the goal of responding to your feedback.</p>
<p>"If Foamstars has become a game that you can enjoy with others, then we couldn't be happier."</p>

<p>Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin called Foamstars a "serviceable paintballer... lathered with some wild lore and underwhelming hero shooter elements" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-review">review</a>, asking: "What does it say about this shooter if the... character details are more entertaining than the 10-minute shooting galleries that precede them?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA Game Ready version 566.36 driver is now available for download, introducing support for this month's biggest games, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>Besides featuring optimizations for the highly anticipated game developed by MachineGames, which launches in a few hours for owners of either the Premium Edition or the Collector's Edition, the new Game Ready driver brings support for Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-path-of-exile-2-to-the-list-premium-monthly-subscription-is-50-off-until-december-30/">Path of Exile 2</a>, as well as support for the next Forza Motorsport update, which introduces ray-traced global illumination, and for the next Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 update which brings NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS 3, both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Marvel Rivals will release with support for NVIDIA's tech which boosts performance considerably at all resolutions and on all RTX 4000 series GPU. In MachineGames' title, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 3 can double performance on an RTX 4090 at 4K resolution, Supreme preset, and ray tracing. In Marvel Rivals, using NVIDIA DLSS 3 can boost performance by 2.8 times on average at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-foamstars-season-will-be-its-last-square-enix-says.1052598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that the next&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>season, which is due to begin next week, will be the game's last, although you'll still be able to play online if you want to.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, Square Enix says the "Party Goes On!" season for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, which starts on December 13th and runs until January 17th, will be the last season, and that "season updates for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>will be coming to an end" after this period.</p>

<p>Following the end of&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>seasons, "expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay", Square Enix says, including customizing shots for characters and "new enhancement elements".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=tHAZsSaR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=dFfxNseu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more new seasons after next week's.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix goes on to say that the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>servers will remain active, as will "all online services" for the game, so it's not being taken offline; it just won't be receiving any more characters or maps, it seems.</p>

<p>Additionally, the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>Cup, a "series of in-game events named after each character", will be held following the next season's conclusion, and all of the game's previous Season Passes will be made available again to give you a chance to get anything you might have missed the first time around.</p>

<p>The decision to end seasons for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. When the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released</a>, a PlayStation Plus subscription was required to play it, and it was a premium product to boot.</p>

<p>However, in October, the PS Plus requirement was dropped and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october" rel="nofollow">the game went free-to-play</a>, perhaps indicating that Square Enix wasn't attracting the kind of player numbers it would have liked for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, it's a multiplayer party arena shooter that's essentially Square Enix's attempt to wrest the family-friendly multiplayer crown from Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>.</p>

<p>The game sees teams of players competing against one another across a series of gameplay modes. Rather than ink, characters can shoot foam from their guns, and the foam can help your team or hinder your opponents depending on where you fire it.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/foamstars/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PlayStation</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/foamstars-review-partys-over" rel="nofollow">read my review here</a> to find out what I thought of this&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>competitor.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The staff and contributors that make up Remap play all sorts of video games, and you hear us talk about most of them on weekly episodes of Remap Radio. But even with nearly three hours of banter, some games don’t make the cut, or simply do not fit into the flow of conversation. We also don’t do a lot of “reviews” here at Remap, so we needed to find something that fit in-between.</em></p><p><em>Every month, Remap Recommends is a chance for each of us to sit back and reflect on a game that’s continued to sit with us, to the point that we want to tell you, in writing, why it’s interesting.</em></p><p><em>These aren’t traditional reviews. They’re not long essays. This is “Hey, check this out. I liked it.”</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommendsarco">Patrick Recommends...<em>Arco</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC, Mac, Switch<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Delightfully violent anti-colonial, anti-capitalist fantasy tactics RPG<br><strong>Finally Finished:</strong> Months after I started, but over the recent holiday<br><strong>What If I'm Bad at These Games? </strong>You're good. I'm bad at them, too</p><p>The video game industry has never felt more tumultuous, and yet, if you had no understanding of the business of making video games, you would simply sit in awe at the sheer number of incredible video games released seemingly every day. I <em>understand</em> the business of making video games (or, at least, I try), and I'm <em>also</em> in awe at the sheer number of incredible video games released seemingly every day.</p><p>One of my goals towards the end of 2024 has been to drill down on a handful of independent games. Over the recent holiday, I spent significant time with some impressive and interesting games, like <em>1000xResist</em> and <em>Arctic Egg</em>s. But the game that I want to tell you about, the one that's lingered in my mind, is still <em>Arco</em>.</p><p>It's a game that caught my eye when it was released in late August, and I have been slowly plucking my way through it. I have an (in)arguably unhealthy obsession with finishing games, one I'm trying to kick, but <em>Arco</em> is a game where I felt <em>guilty</em> for not seeing it through, because I've loved it's demanding. push-and-pull combat system, which rewards players for aggression, rather than cowering in the shadows. I love its strange world, which pulls from ingrained "western" iconography, but pushes back on our celebration of such images. And that's before you start talking about the interesting supernatural elements on its fringes.</p><p>I get why so many folks haven't given <em>Arco</em> the time of day. Another tactics game in a sea of tactics game, where near every niche is catered? Oh, and it has <em>pixel</em> art? </p><p>(Honestly, these days, I feel like pixel art might be a turnoff for some people.)</p><p>But <em>Arco</em> is good—very good. It's thoughtful and smart and violent and considerate and does not waste your time. There's a lot of video games released in 2024 that feel like they'll be the subject of a long YouTube essay in a few years, and I suspect Arco will be among them. So in the meantime, why wait for that YouTube essay?</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-diplomacy-is-not-an-option">Rob Recommends...<em> Diplomacy Is Not an Option</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>The cutscenes go on too long but do have some funny beats.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Base-building survival RTS</p><div><p>Light-weight survival strategy is one of my favorite genres. The rhythm of "explore map, prepare defenses, fend off hordes, repeat" is one of the surest ways to <a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/they-are-billions-burning-hundreds-hours/" rel="noreferrer">keep me glued to my monitor</a>, and <em>Diplomacy Is Not an Option </em>delivers pretty much exactly what you want and expect from a game like this.</p><p>The game gives you the option of being a decadent noble fending off rebelling peasants while building ever more elaborate cities and defenses, with some familiar elements from <em>They Are Billions </em>like making it imperative that you send your army out to clear the map to prevent the recurring waves from growing too powerful when they arrive. The tension between expanding your base and bringing new resource patches behind your walls versus upgrading your existing forces and keeping your defensive lines smaller and stronger is familiar, but it's done well here and the powerful magic spells you can cast bring some real novelty to the action. Special shoutout goes to a lightning attack that follows your mouse cursor, which carves and incredible swath through enemy hordes.</p></div><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-an-old-favorite">Cado Recommends... An Old Favorite</h3><figure></figure><p>I don’t know about you but I've had a hell of a month. November hit me like a ton of bricks on both the personal and external scale. </p><p>Between putting on Save Point, the added anxiety of the election, a rapidly shifting political climate that meant I could no longer put off coming out to my family, and my grandfather passing at the end of the month, it all left me very little time to check out new releases. But it also left a need for some comfort in the small moments that I did find myself with free time. </p><p>For me, this specific mix of circumstances meant I played about 15 hours of <em>Slay the Spire</em> in 10-15 minute chunks throughout the month of November in order to keep myself sane.</p><p>I have dipped in and out of the game many times before and enjoyed it but never really drilled down and did any ascensions, the game’s escalating challenge modifiers, because I never thought I was  good enough at the game to warrant the extra challenge, despite having unlocked the first ascension ages ago. The last time I played the game in any real concerted way about a year ago, I still had a few cards to unlock, so I just did normal runs until I finished out my collection for my favorite class, the Silent. Once I’d done that, it really felt like I’d “beaten” the game, and didn’t see myself coming back to it anytime soon. Alexander wept.</p><p>As this past month got more and more hectic, however, I found myself grasping for something that could sooth my soul, so I booted up <em>Slay the Spire</em>. In an attempt to wrestle control back from the world, I set myself a new goal: lock in and climb the ascension ladder. Turns out that the steady, incremental addition of new challenges each ascension offers was exactly what I needed to properly return to <em>Slay the Spire</em>. A perfect mix of the familiar and the challenging, a warm blanket of gaming fresh out of the dryer during a particularly nasty cold front in my life.&nbsp;</p><p>My recommendation to you is: give yourself space to return. As a culture, we can favor newness to a fault, but sometimes the best thing we can do for ourselves is to be retrospective. You can’t always move forward without taking stock of what you’ve left behind, so make sure to give yourself the space to do so when you need it. You never know when something old can still surprise you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-responds-to-claims-its-flex-subscription-is-a-scam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NZXT has released a lengthy response to claims that its Flex gaming PC subscription <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-scam-allegations-gamers-nexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">service is a scam</a>. After an hour-long video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamers Nexus</a> dove into what it called a “predatory computer scam” from NZXT, the company not only posted a video with statements from its CEO Johnny Hou, but also listed out some of the actions they state will be taken.</p>



<p>“NZXT takes feedback seriously and, ultimately, wouldn’t be here if we didn’t listen to our community,” he said. “A lot of the issues are very serious, and it’s really important to us that we address each and every one of them.”</p>



<p>Regarding price increases after a subscription is started, Hou said that the “only instance” it’s happened is when they were required by certain states to start charging state taxes. </p>



<p>Hou then went on to talk about claims and “misconceptions” around changes to the hardware specs.</p>



<p>“You have to first understand that the Flex program doesn’t give you fixed specs,” he said. “We it comes to the availability of PC parts, it’s hard for us to control when Nvidia or Intel or AMD decide they’re going to need all the parts, so sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in. So, in the midst of that, we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>He then reaffirmed that you have to be at least 18 years old to sign up for the service. However, he didn’t address the claims that orders were being pushed through without proper identity verification. </p>



<p>As far as actions go, NZXT says that it will be pulling all “influencer-led” Flex advertising after statements were made within the adds that the company found to “not accurately reflect the details” of the program. They will also be updating the names of products offered through the Flex service in order to provide “a very clear distinction” between what is being bought versus what is part of the subscription.</p>



<p>After those two actions were announced, the <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company listed details</a> about what the Flex subscription program is and is not. You can read that via the company’s website.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamers-nexus-response">Gamers Nexus’ Response</h2>



<p>Not long after the response from NZXT, Gamers Nexus — the original source of the uncovering — made its own statement on what NZXT said. </p>



<p>“NZXT has posted a statement which not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program,” Gamers Nexus Editor-in-Chief Stephen Burke wrote. “The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns. GamersNexus has become aware of deeper elements connected to this story that GN has begun independently investigating.”</p>

<p>Delta Force, a highly-anticipated shooter reminiscent of Battlefield is out <strong>today</strong>. It was pieced together by Team Jade, a branch of TiMi Studio Group, the company that built the most popular COD game of all time – Call of Duty Mobile. For now, it’s a multiplayer-only offering, but Team Jade has confirmed when the game’s single-player campaign will be released.</p>



<p>There isn’t all that long to wait – the single-player portion of Delta Force will be available in January 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force, which started life <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> before the name came under scrutiny, is available today in open beta on PC.</p>



<p>In earlier testing periods, Delta Force presented an enjoyable and authentic large-scale combat experience that felt diverse and satisfying. Many have dubbed it ‘the better version of Battlefield 2042’, and it has plenty to offer users as it transitions into this open beta period.</p>



<p>Most players will be diving into the ‘Warfare’ mode, a 32 v 32 PvP mode bursting at the seams with military might. Users will be invited to explore land and air vehicles and go boots-on-the-ground with a dense arsenal of weapons across a series of maps.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, there is the ‘Operations’ portion of the game. This is a cooperative mode that pits three players against AI-controlled enemies as they explore developing objectives across a variety of environments.</p>



<p>Team Jade confirmed that in January, the game’s <strong>single-player </strong>component, a story based on the real-world events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, will be released on all platforms. That’ll arrive shortly after the game, which is designed to be crossplay across multiple platforms, is released on the iOS Store and Google Play, opening up two new, huge markets.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the ‘Black Hawk Down’ portion of Delta Force? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher NetEase have revealed a brand new gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>, the open-world anime action RPG formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>.</p>

<p>The name change was <a href="https://x.com/Ananta_EN/status/1862316133988409359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">put into effect in late November</a>, and at that point, NetEase and Naked Rain teased a new gameplay trailer for the game, which has now arrived. It looks exactly as you'd expect; essentially like a cross between the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and a strange anime-inflected&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>'s central hub of Nova City, which is where you'll be spending most of your time, whether you're taking on one of the game's missions or engaging in its many minigames and distractions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=USXTSxJh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=zznkKgiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ananta</em>, formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>, has a brand new gameplay trailer for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer is positioning&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>as a sort of everything-RPG; not only can you take on exciting, high-octane combat missions in the game, but you can also kick back and relax by driving through the city, playing volleyball, or just grabbing a bite to eat.</p>

<p>In a press release, NetEase and Naked Rain describe <i>Ananta</i>'s world as a place "where the unexpected is the norm and having fun is the ultimate goal".</p>

<p>While you'll be spending most of your time in Nova City, the two studios say you'll also be able to visit other "interconnected cities" to take on challenges, and they're also promising "kung fu movie"-style combat in which you can utilize your surroundings to defeat your enemies.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play RPG, but NetEase and Naked Rain haven't revealed what kind of monetization the game will employ. It does rather resemble a HoYoverse-style gacha game, but we'll likely learn whether that's the case in the coming months.</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be released, but when it is, it'll land on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/project-mugen-interview" rel="nofollow">interview with the game's producer here</a>.</p>

            <p>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian">Fantasian</a> was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit's exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> for us PC heads, calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian-neo-dimension">Fantasian Neo Dimension</a>. It's actually out today, too, if you're interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension has you play as Leo, who awakens in a strange land filled with machines and zero recollection of how and why and who. Soon he discovers that the machines are suffering from a virus called "Mechteria" that's really not a good thing for humans or robots alike. And so, it's up to you and your pals to engage in turn-based fights and free the world from the virus.</p>

<p>Fantasian's neat spin on turn-based battling lies in how you're able to target multiple enemies, whether that's in a straight line, or in an arc, or in large AoE blasts. You're also able to 'collect' random encounters as you're exploring out in the world, so you can fight them all at once for a large cash-in when it suits you - an excellent time-saver.</p>
<p>And on the world front, it's rather nice eh? It blends handmade dioramas with CG, which gives exploration quite the striking aesthetic.</p>
<p>If you're a longtime fan who knows all this stuff and wants the lowdown on the new features, I've got you. There's new Japanese and English voice overs, new difficulty options, 4K resolution, and the option to switch the battle music from the original soundtrack to songs from across the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can find these by tapping on the Missions button on the bottom right of the Home or Battle screens. You’ll be sent to the Genetic Apex Dex Missions screen, but you want to look toward the bottom right again and tap on the Themed Collections button. At the bottom of this list will be a handful of missions that award you with an icon. These are the icons and associated missions for the Genetic Apex Expansion:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Electrode Icon: Collect 3 Electrode cards</li><li>Gardevoir Icon: Collect 5 Gardevoir cards</li><li>Charizard Icon: Collect 5 Charizard cards</li><li>Mewtwo Icon: Collect 5 Mewtwo cards</li></ul><p>In addition to those above, a set of icons is exclusive to a secret mission. <strong>Registering 226 cards in the Dex will cause a new mission to appear. Completing it will unlock icons for Mewtwo, Pikachu, and Charizard.</strong> Although that is a lot of cards to register, it only counts those with Diamond rarities. You won’t need to collect the rarer Star or Crown cards with full art illustrations. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange System</a></span> can cut down time for any of these missions, although using it to complete the Dex will be especially useful.</p><p>The second method is to buy icons from the shop. So far, these seem to be limited to events and can be missed. A Meowth Icon was available during the second part of a Wonder Pick Event that ran during the first half of November. It was also exchangeable only with exclusive Event Shop Tickets that naturally expired. Outside of promo pack cards, being tied to the most FOMO-inducing of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">the game’s currencies</a></span> makes these icons particularly rare, so keep an eye out for them when they appear on the shop.</p><h2 id="h74286"><a id="change"></a>How To Change Your Profile Icon</h2><figure id="" data-id="0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-recommend-id="image://0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-recommend-id="image://0fceccffed0b2f7cfa88bd4321e0d6e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Select Icon screen shows seven different icons and highlights one of Electrode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Changing your profile icon is an easy thing to do, thankfully. From the home screen, tap on the small round image of your current icon at the top. This will take you to what is essentially your profile page, where you can adjust options such as your Player Name or what your featured cards are. Tap the larger-sized picture at the top and you’ll bring up the Select Icon menu. You can now switch between any of the initial six profile icons or those you’ve obtained.</p><p>I do want to highlight that this menu only displays what has been unlocked so far. There aren’t any handy greyed-out icons or anything to signify that you might have more to unlock. Be sure to keep up with the events and open boosters whenever possible to add more icons to your selection.</p><hr><p>We can assume that unlocking <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> icons in the future will function similarly to how they do now. Fingers crossed that they add some permanently to the shop, or maybe mix it up with different types of missions.

<p>Square Enix is pulling the plug on future Foamstars season updates, less than a year after the game’s release.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, the studio said that season updates for the game will end on January 17 at the conclusion of the “Party Goes On!” season of the game. With this final season update, the studio is introducing features to “enhance gameplay”.</p>



<p>Those include the ability to customize shots for each character as well as new various enhancement elements.</p>



<p>“All online services will remain available after the “Party Goes One!” season ends,” Square Enix said. “In addition, we plan to hold the Foamstars Cup, a series of in-game events named after each character.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>



<p>First launched in February 2024 exclusively for PlayStation, Foamstars released to little fanfare. Ultimately, the game went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play in October</a> in order to build its player base.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that gaming actively prevents someone from succumbing to a catastrophic accident, but here we are. On social media, one user recently told the tale of how an Xbox Series S console <strong>may </strong>have saved his life when he was hit by a truck and sent sprawling from his bicycle.</p>



<p>Per the post, the Xbox Series S in his backpack prevented him from striking his head against the curb, and while he didn’t escape unscathed, he believes that if he wasn’t carrying the Series S, <strong>he could have died</strong>.</p>

I managed to keep above the trucks steel bumper at first but I eventually was dragged under. I was slammed to the ground and still he kept going so I assumed he didn’t see me. The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. </p>



<p>I wasn’t gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck. At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards. I look to my left and I feel the full weight of the front end of this truck roll up on my ribs and roll back off. </p>



<p>The truck hit and dragged me 12 feet and soon I was rushed to the hospital with only a single broken bone in my left foot and a few road rashes. I thought the Xbox was a goner but It started up with no hesitation at all and runs games surprisingly well considering what it went through. </p>



<p>If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, Xbox offered to send Brandon a new Xbox console. The images shown by Brandon reveal a bashed, beaten, and bruised console that amazingly still works just fine. They were uploaded alongside shots of a hoodie bearing signs of some serious road rash.</p>

<p>In the comments under the post on social media, some users started joking that PlayStation could never, and others recommended that GameStop should start listing consoles for sale with crash test ratings. </p>



<p>Many jokes are made about the Xbox Series S, especially those focused on the console’s performance, but at least we can say it’s at least structurally sound.</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has detailed a few more details on its much-anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> OG mode, which brings back the game's beloved original battle royale Island as a newly-permanent addition. 
</p>
<p>
As previously suspected, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG will rotate through the game's original Chapter 1 seasons</a>. Today, we learned that these will begin with a season lasting until 31st January - so roughly two months. 
</p>
<p>
This means, of course, shorter seasons than the original Fortnite Chapter 1 featured - and shorter than the game's main Chapter 6 version. But we're all waiting for the meteor impact and the volcano anyway, right? So this is good news.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite OG will feature solos and squads modes at launch, with both classic building enabled and Zero Build options. 
</p>
<p>
Other improvements from the original Chapter 1 will include modern building mechanics and traversal options to sprint, slide, mantle, door bash and move while healing. Epic Games does not make mention of the very latest mechanics added in Chapter 6, such as wall jumping.
</p><p>
As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite OG will also feature its own distinct battle pass</a>, which will feature 45 tiers of rewards. This is one of the four in-game passes now included in the £10 a month Fortnite Crew subscription, and offers three skins plus other bits and pieces. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously brought back its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">hugely-popular original Fortnite map 12 months ago</a> for a limited time, the launch of which saw the game hit 44.7 million players in 24 hours. Last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">Fortnite broke its own player record for a live concert event</a>, with 14 million concurrent players tuning in to watch Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Ice Spice and Juice WRLD.

			<p>Following the Black Friday GeForce NOW promotion that <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-black-friday-deal-halves-price-of-3-month-premium-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discounted</a> premium tiers (Performance and Ultimate) by 50% for three-month subscriptions, NVIDIA has announced another promotion that will run through December 50. The discount is the same (50%), but it will now be applied to new monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames will be supported by GeForce NOW on day one. Owners of the Ultimate tier will be able to activate all the technical bells and whistles, such as NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. By the way, the game's official requirements have just been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>.</p>
<p>The other big weekly addition to GFN is Path of Exile 2, which debuts tomorrow on early access. Our Francesco De Meo had this to say about the action RPG following a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-off preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time</em>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GFN_Thursday-Holiday_Sale.png"></a></figure>

<p>The remaining weekly additions for GeForce NOW users are JR EAST Train Simulator and its demo (both on Steam). NVIDIA also shared the full lineup for the remainder of December.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is out <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and it’s set to introduce a cultural shift in the hero shooter space, challenging the dominant position held by Overwatch 2 and snatching the attention away from Deadlock. Recently, the team at NetEase have been discussing how the game will work, revealing more characters and mechanics, further stoking the hype train.</p>



<p>One tidbit of information about how the game’s battle pass is going to work turned heads more than anything else, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-more-fomo">No More FOMO</h2>



<p>Typically, live-service games have seasonal battle passes that expire at the end of a given window, and thereafter, you’re prevented from unlocking any content you’ve missed and you’ll need to move on to the next season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241205/40954_1198123.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to challenge that</a> typical behaviour with a new mechanic: timeless battle passes.</p>



<p>When you purchase the ‘Luxury Battle Pass’, which is the paid version of the free battle pass, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem awards in said pass event after the season has ended. If you don’t dedicate enough time to the game to unlock the rewards in one season, they’ll roll over into the next, but you’ll be free to <strong>also </strong>move on to the next season if you desire.</p>



<p>That means that you won’t miss out on unlocking something <strong>far </strong>into the Luxury Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals just because you might not have the time to grind for it.</p>



<p>Not only that, but NetEase has recognised that the first season (or pre-season) of Marvel Rivals is going to be a shorter one, so they’ve reduced the price of the Luxury Battle Pass by 50% at launch.</p>



<p>Other developers have had their ways of addressing this ‘missing out’ issue. For instance, Bethesda Game Studios often offers ‘catch-up’ bundles in the Fallout 76 store, giving users the ability to catch up on missed rewards, but that comes with a hefty cost.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good tactic that other developers should mirror? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimsix Has Returned to OpTic After Five Years Away]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimsix-has-returned-to-optic-after-five-years-away.1052505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter has returned home, gravitating back to OpTic Gaming after a five-year hiatus. His Call of Duty career ended in 2022, and since then, he has become a successful racecar driver and iRacing creator. Following his departure from OpTic Gaming in 2019, Crimsix floated with a couple of organisations in the Call of Duty League but ultimately retired in September 2022.</p>



<p>In a seven-minute video posted on social media, OpTic welcomed back Crimsix, explaining why it’s such a natural decision to make all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-where-he-belongs">Back Where He Belongs</h2>



<p>Crimsix is part of the Call of Duty ‘dynasty’ represented by Scump, FormaL, Karma, and of course, the man himself. He’s the winningest Call of Duty player in the business, and his profile and abilities helped to spearhead the growth of the COD esports scene.</p>



<p>In 2022, he officially retired from Call of Duty and spun off into something completely different: racecars. Those who know Porter recognise his love for cars, and in the video posted by OpTic, he revealed that most of his income was spent in some way on cars, whether it be buying, maintaining, or upgrading them.</p>



<p>Speaking in <a href="https://x.com/OpTic/status/1864461424904302688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the video uploaded on Twitter</a>, OpTic’s CEO, Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back to normal. Throughout the years, we’ve always kept in touch, he’s of my favourite players of all time, what he did for OpTic – it put us in a position to win every time.</p>



<p>I’ll always be appreciative of the time he spent here, so it was only right that when the time came for him to come back, after years of butting heads with FormaL, butting heads with Scump… </p>



<p>Bringing him back as we are is inevitable, he’s part of the family and he’ll always be part of the family.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crimsix has been streaming plenty of Black Ops 6 during his downtime, and many have stressed that the former pro player still has the thumbs needed to win big, prompting plenty of long-time fans to demand his return to Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>That’s not going to happen, though – but he does have a place back under the OpTic umbrella, and that’s worth celebrating.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Crimsix back in OpTic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Players will soon be able to have Agent 47 take a few pot shots (other methods are available) at none other than Jean-Claude Van Damme, with the actor lending his likeness to Hitman's next Elusive Target: Max Valliant aka The Splitter.</p>
<p>Max Valliant is described as one of the ICA's "most formidable operatives", and one whom everyone assumed to be dead and gone. But, of course, that isn't actually the case, and now he is back and causing trouble. Agent 47 needs to put a stop to that, and will head to Chongqing for the occasion.</p>
<p>The Splitter will both be available as part of the Free Starter Pack for new players (although, not on Switch) and as a regular Elusive Target for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a> players. Interested in giving it a shot? Well, you will be able to take down Valliant from 12th December, until 12th January. Here's a trailer:</p>

<p>"Max Valliant is quite the entertaining character, bringing a lot of action movie villain energy, he is ruthless, and of course, he can do the split!" shared Jean-Claude Van Damme. "The Splitter is a thrilling mission and like in any good action flick, Hitman players will have a few surprises, but I'll let them find out by themselves."</p><p>Van Damme is known for his love of doing the splits, as you can see in the header image above. In fact, when developer IOI first teased The Splitter, <a href="https://www.hitmanforum.com/t/new-elusive-target-the-splitter-winter-2024/22258/20">many guessed</a> the actor would be one of Agent 47's upcoming targets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-lower-end-ps5-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored PlayStation 5 handheld will unlikely be able to play PS5 games natively and will probably require dedicated versions of new games.</p>
<p>Commenting on the recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">&nbsp;rumors</a> regarding Sony's return to the handheld market following the PS Vita, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> made some interesting observations on what the systems could actually be, highlighting how it will not be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, as what is currently achieved on a 200 watts system will be impossible to achieve on 20 watts system even in a few years down the road. As such, scaling down games will be required to get games to run on the system, similar to how the Nintendo Switch handles running games in handheld mode. Sony already showed how scaling up is entirely possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ultimate-comparison/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, so scaling down shouldn't be impossible.</p>
<p>The real question is how scaling games down will be handled by this PlayStation 5 handheld. The Microsoft handheld, for example, may be similar to how things are handled for the Steam Deck and similar systems due to the company's approach, letting the user tweak the graphics settings of the PC version of games to get games running decently. In addition, Microsoft could use the Xbox Series S profile available for all their games to get them to run decently on their handheld without leaving the user to configure settings. Sony, on the other hand, doesn't have a lower-end PlayStation 5 model, so the handheld would require dedicated versions of games, while older games would need to be patched in order to run on the system. As such, the PlayStation 5 handheld could be the PS5 lower-end system that Sony currently doesn't have that will offer a slice of what the base model offers in terms of visual fidelity and potentially backward compatibility.</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation Handheld Is Real... But Will It Really Run PS5 Games?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh3lAfsKdrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the current reports suggest that this PlayStation 5 handheld is still far from release, so it will be a very long time before we can see what it will be capable of and if it will ever be able to put a dent into the Nintendo Switch's popularity, whose concept of home console and handheld all-in-one system will likely only get more popular with the release of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/">yet-to-be-revealed</a> successor.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-action-strategy-game-kingmakers-delayed-to-next-year.1052466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-delayed-q1-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Redemption Road and publisher tinyBuild have announced that ambitious upcoming action-strategy sandbox hybrid game&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4445711438670988556" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a> (which is, rather amusingly, worded as though it were an old-timey town crier decree), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>will now launch "nay later than the end o' Q1 2025". I suppose the originally-slated release window of 2024 was pretty much unattainable given we're in December now.</p>

<p>The premise of&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>is a pretty novel one; it revolves around players being able to travel back in time with modern weaponry and lay waste to medieval armies in order to change the course of a war and "stave off the apocalypse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=zY9dK4Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingmakers-delayed-shooting.jpg?itok=WKlZAUh3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>promises some astoundingly historically inaccurate action-sandbox shenanigans.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not a million miles away from the premise of 2009 FPS&nbsp;<em>Darkest of Days</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>isn't an FPS; rather, it's an ambitious and sprawling mixture of action, strategy, city-building, and sandbox gameplay.</p>

<p>You'll engage in battles in which soldiers are "controlled by a next-gen multi-threaded AI" and animated by "a unique procedural animation system". In those battles, you'll use modern weaponry like machine guns, attack helicopters, and air strikes to "wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield".</p>

<p>The game will also feature base-building elements and real-time strategy gameplay; you'll be able to zoom out and issue orders to your soldiers before joining the fray yourself, watching the plan you've built be executed in real time.</p>




<p><em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>may not be out yet, but its publisher tinyBuild clearly has faith that it's going to be a smash hit. Back in August, the studio announced that a&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">movie is in production</a> in conjunction with movie studio Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>We still don't have a full release date for&nbsp;<em>Kingmakers&nbsp;</em>yet, but given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-financials-2023" rel="nofollow">financial straits tinyBuild appears to be in right now</a>, it likely can't come soon enough. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right now</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward-one-week.1052463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has moved the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>release date forward a week, and there are new goodies coming for the game this week as well.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media platform X</a>, the studio confirms that the game's new release date is February 4th, which is exactly a week before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">originally intended launch date of February 11th</a>.</p>

<p>That should come as a pleasant surprise for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>fans, especially since the game's original release date technically constituted a delay. It was originally meant for release sometime in 2024.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=2_uzGPdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-early-henry-horse.jpg?itok=eC1LdW1B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>a whole week early.</figcaption></figure><p>In the release date announcement post, Warhorse also says that more info about&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way this week, with a new story trailer for the game set to debut later today.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll also be learning the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>PC specs this week, as well as "console specs", which presumably refers to what modes the console versions of the game will offer, as well as whether it'll join the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, an open-world adventure that emphasizes realistic combat and historical detail.</p>

<p>The second game will once again revolve around protagonist Henry of Skalitz, which also means that like its predecessor, it'll be set in 15th-century medieval Europe.</p>




<p>As well as bringing back many elements from the first game, including multiple approaches to combat and quest completion,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will also feature ranged weaponry like crossbows, as well as firearms.</p>

<p>Lest you think the introduction of new features will cause Warhorse to scale the story back, however, think again; the studio confirmed back in August that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">contains over two million words</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 4th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>The world is changing. Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-youre-not-imagining-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-combat-feeling-off-theres-a-good-reason-for-it">lack of hitstop</a> in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://x.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522">handy breakdown of the issue</a> by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.</p>

<p>"Some of the changes in the hitstop were obviously intentional, and some were not implemented due to the settings of the game," director Yuya Tokuda said at a recent press event, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-hitstop-feels-way-better-in-the-non-beta-build-and-the-games-director-was-happy-to-juice-it-back-up-after-overseas-players-apparently-hated-it-in-world/">via GamesRadar</a>. "When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> was released, many of the users from overseas commented that the hitstop was way too hard and it made it difficult for them to play. So it's very positive feedback seeing the users who experienced the [Wilds open beta test] this time saying that they missed the hitstop that they were experiencing in past titles."</p><p>"It's a very unique <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> experience being able to experience that hitstop," Tokuda continued. "So it's very positive feedback from my perspective. In the current version that I think you guys had hands-on gameplay with, there was obviously a little bit of adjustment compared to the [open beta]. And for the full product version, there will be adjustments. For example, the finishing moves will have adjustments to hitstop as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/were-at-the-next-level-monster-hunter-wilds-creators-on-the-secret-behind-capcoms-new-golden-era/">Very Gary Computing</a> also had a big chat with the Wilds team, in which series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto also mentioned some bugs from the beta they’d since ironed out. "The monsters were moving more often than intended," he said. "It wasn’t actually a design intention to have them be so rapidly moving, it was just that every X amount of seconds they just were moving on, and it wasn’t something we were planning for - the general processing of how monsters decide where to go next and what to do, that’s being refined towards the full game."</p>
<p>The VGC piece is well worth a read, not least for Yuya Tokuda going into detail about the new endgame it sounds they’ve got planned for Wilds:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects will be related to the environmental change system that happens in Monster Hunter Wilds. You’ll be doing things like having a synergistic relationship between the monsters that you’re hunting and the environment itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you hunt this monster now, that might make something happen like this one becomes easier to hunt later or harder to hunt later. The details are going to be discussed later, but I’m confident that players who love [past games’] end-game cycles will be really pleased with what’s in store.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion: bonk. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
