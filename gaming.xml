<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is MSI’s latest motherboard geared towards that mid-to-lower premium range of gamers and power users who need a board that can handle top-tier components and future upgrades. Featuring the new LGA 1851 designed for the new Intel Arrow Lake processors, MSI put in one of its best efforts when it comes to features, ease of use, an overall look. But is there enough here to justify the $400-plus price point?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review</h2>



<p>Despite what people might tell you, a quality motherboard can be just as important as the CPU going in your system. In many ways, it’s the backbone of your gaming rig, and <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MPG-Z890-CARBON-WIFI/Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picking the right one</a> can make or break your experience. What MSI has with the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is a product aimed at making that experience as easy as possible, no matter how well versed you are in building your own machine.</p>



<p>It all starts with the overall design.</p>



<p>Building a PC can sometimes feel like a test of patience, but this motherboard makes it as painless as possible. The pre-mounted I/O shield is a small but welcome touch, saving you from the hassle of aligning it just right and possibly snapping or bending the shield. Labels on the board itself are clear and beginner-friendly, making it easier to slot everything into place without second-guessing yourself.</p>



<p>Installing components is refreshingly simple. The tool-less PCIe x16 slot release is a game-changer for those rocking a massive GPU like the RTX 4090 as there’s no more wrestling with tiny latches or putting an obnoxious amount of pressure just to unlock the card from the board. And the screwless M.2 installation? A dream. Pop the drive in, click it down, and you’re done.</p>

<h3 id="h-layout-amp-accessibility">Layout &amp; Accessibility</h3>



<p>MSI does a solid job with the board’s overall layout. Everything feels well-placed on this ATX board, making cable management and clean builds way more achievable.</p>



<p>There are three PCIe slots for components. The top is PCIe 5.0 x16, perfect for modern graphics cards. The middle slot is PCIe 5.0 x8 while the third is PCIe 4.0 x4.</p>



<p>For storage, there are plenty of options. Five M.2 slots give you plenty of space to make sure you always have enough storage on your machine. My only problem is that only one supports PCIe 5.,0 speeds. For a motherboard in this price range, you’d expect at least two or three. If you’re planning a full Gen 5 build, that could be a letdown.</p>



<p>With cooling and RGB, there are 7 fan headers, 4 RGB headers, a 3-pin water flow sensor, and a 2-pin thermal sensor that gives you a lot of flexibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-connectivity-galore-and-then-some">Connectivity Galore (And Then Some)</h3>



<p>When you are spending, possibly, as much as your CPU on the motherboard, one thing you’ll want to make sure of is that what you buy has the connections you need. And one thing the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi doesn’t skimp on is connectivity.</p>



<p>On the rear I/O, there are 13 total USB ports—10 USB-A 3.2 and 3 USB-C. The 10 USB-A ports support up to 10Gbps while one of the USB-C ports also supports 10Gbps. The other two USB-C are Thunderbolt 4 with DisplayPort output that have speeds up to 40Gbps.</p>



<p>If you need more USB functionality, there are four USB 2.0 headers, four USB 5Gbps Type-A headers, and even a single 20Gbps USB Type C header. Again, if you need connections, this board <em>has </em>connections. With everything I use on a daily basis—Stream Deck, capture card, audio interface, and multiple external drives, just  to name a few—I have found no issue with speeds or connection quality in the months I’ve used this motherboard. For full transparency, there were times with the last-gen Z790 Carbon WiFi where you could sense a noticeable slowdown when trying to move files across external drives even with a high-end CPU. That hasn’t happened once with the Z890.</p>



<p>For the wireless user, the motherboard supports Wi-Fi 7 with speeds up to 5.8Gbps as well as Bluetooth 5.4. There are still some issues with Bluetooth audio cutting in and out, but I have yet to find a motherboard that works perfectly on that front. Two LAN ports support 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps.</p>



<p>On the audio front, the board has built-in optical output with 7.1 channel audio.</p>



<h3 id="h-bios-amp-customization">BIOS &amp; Customization</h3>



<p>It’s long been my opinion that MSI has one of the most user-friendly BIOS there is. With the Z890 Chipset, this becomes even more so with a new look that makes it even easier to find and adjust the settings you’d like. It’s as straightforward as it can be in my opinion, even if you’re not a seasoned overclocker.</p>



<p>As you’d expect from any BIOS, MSI’s offers users the ability for custom fan control, overclocking, boot order, and more. What makes it stand out, however, is how simple they make it. </p>



<p>The  EZ Mode works as expected, which isn’t always the case with some BIOS. From boosting the CPU to NPU to Memory, everything is one click away, which helps take the worry out of your hands. If you want to get more in the weeds, however, even the Advanced Settings are laid out in a way to prevent you from getting overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Everything from PCIe settings to P-Core and E-Core ratios to CPU and Memory Frequency and more is available for your adjustment. Just be careful. If you do decide to try your hand at overclocking, or messing with the settings at all, take it slowly and in increments. Making too large of a change could lead to stability problems and damage your machine.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s the MSI proprietary software like MSI Center, Mystic Light, and others. Personally, I find these programs to weigh down a system more than help it. Mystic Light for RGB management is kind of a neccessity if that’s what you need to pair with other programs, but for hardware monitoring, there are other lightweight options.</p>



<h3 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review-verdict">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review Verdict</h3>



<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is one motherboard with a ton going for it.  It has plenty of connectivity options, a great-looking design, and is one of the easiest borders to build in for the DIY PC enthusiast. It’s price can scare people away, especially with the belief that the LGA 1851 socket will only be supported with new CPUs until 2026. That said, if you are looking at picking up this board, it’s likely you won’t be upgrading again for quite some time. </p>



<p>The support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 helps future proof the board as much as you can with how fast technology moves. Again, it would’ve been nice for more PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, but I don’t think it’s a deal breaker. If the $400-plus price tag doesn’t scare you away, you’d honestly be hard-pressed to find a more well-rounded motherboard.</p>

If you miss any, they can also be collected in later scenes where you visit the park, such as during Kat's memoir.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few more collectibles than you need here, but here are the main ones you'll likely find:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The seesaw</li><li dir="ltr">The marbles on the ground</li><li dir="ltr">The giant rocketship</li><li dir="ltr">The jungle gym</li><li dir="ltr">The animal-shaped spring riders</li><li dir="ltr">Swing set</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606"></a><figcaption>Filming Dylan after confrontation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The bullies category can be started early on in the game, with the very first encounter with Dylan and Corey during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mild Spoilers: </strong>If you make the same apologetic and non confrontational dialogue choices as I did when dealing with Dylan and Corey, you'll need to <strong>replay this scene in Collectible mode</strong> to get more of these. You need to pick the taunting choices, where you taunt and film Dylan, and then agree to film Corey and his bike.</p><p dir="ltr">The final bully collectibles come from an opportunity to film Corey again later in the game. This comes after near the end of the chapter titled the <strong>Abyss</strong>. This is also optional and missable. Nora will prompt you to film Corey, but the choice is yours.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607"></a><figcaption>Velvet Cove water tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is another easy category. You're basically filming the same Velvet Cove water tower throughout various scenes in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the opportunities are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Film while standing in the Movie Palace parking lot</li><li dir="ltr">Film from Swann's bedroom window in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be filmed from the park in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be seen from the bar parking lot</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608"></a><figcaption>Mothgirl placement at the end of Riot Grrrl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Mothgirl Chronicles collectible category starts during the chapter called <strong>Packing Up</strong>. This is an unmissable part of the story that takes place in Swann's bedroom, and filming Mothgirl for the first time unlocks this collectible category.</p><p dir="ltr">The remaining five collectibles require you to find a special spot where you can place Mothgirl and film. There don't seem to be any extra locations, so you'll need to replay sections if you miss these.</p><p dir="ltr">These hidden locations are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Later, during<strong> Packing Up</strong>, there is a scene with the girls at the lake, and you can place Mothgirl on a nearby rock and film her</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Double Dare</strong>, go up into the attic. You'll want to <strong>do this before you light the fireplace</strong>. Place Mothgirl on the ledge of the open section of the attic. (This collectible appears to be glitched. It lets me place Mothgirl here, but the game marks this as a location I've already recorded even though it wasn't previously recorded or in the footage.)</li><li dir="ltr">In the chapter titled <strong>Kat</strong>, you'll film an interview with her. You'll have the option to explore around the park afterwards, so make sure you <strong>grab your collectibles before telling her you're done</strong>. There are two Mothgirl locations here. Place Mothgirl on both the swing and the slide for two more collectible opportunities</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong>, you'll break into the fenced-off area of the bar. Immediately look right and place Mothgirl in the lounge chair on the right</li><li dir="ltr">After turning on the power during Riot Grrrls, run back to Nora's band setup and place Mothgirl on one of the speakers</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609"></a><figcaption>Bunny car pictured with the moo box on top of it for optional trophy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Terrible Toys memoir category requires you to film weird toys you find while on your adventures. Not all of these are available at this time, as Don't Nod told GameSpot that one of them is only found in Tape 2, coming this April, but here are the five known locations so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called The First Night, you can find a collectible when helping Kat look for the keys. You'll see a <strong>troll doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another toy can be found during The First Night chapter. When looking for something to knock down the keys, you follow Autumn into a junkyard. Here you'll find a <strong>creepy doll</strong> to film at the campsite</li><li dir="ltr">The third one you'll encounter is during the chapter called Garage Band. Inside Nora's garage you'll find a weird <strong>bunny car</strong> to film</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Grab the item sitting on top of the bunny car and inspect it. Rotating the item until it moos like a cow will <strong>unlock the hidden MOO! trophy/achievement</strong> to "Make the moo box moo."</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The next is found during chapter - Lights, Camera, Action! Before you follow your friends across the tree bridge, turn right towards the lake to find another <strong>creepy doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">The next is a <strong>voodoo doll</strong> that can be found in various times and locations. The best times to look are either during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark or This Old House. Head up into the cabin's attic to find a voodoo doll. The doll can also be found later in the story on a trail leading away from the cabin, or in a small cave entrance. It can only be counted once, though</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that since not all Terrible Toys can be found yet, it may also be the case that some other collectible categories can be finished in Tape 2, likely making those easier to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610"></a><figcaption>Strangers at the bar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are seven collectibles needed for the Strangers memoir category. The entire category is really easy to miss, depending on how you approach specific moments in the game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The first four can be discovered during the chapter called <strong>The Day We Met</strong>. Before interacting with any characters, use the ladder on the right side of the Movie Palace. You can climb up and get a view of two sets of characters. Corey and Dylan are at the back, and Nora and Autumn are at the Yooper Scooper ice cream shack. Use the camcorder to view them and then record each one as strangers</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There's a <strong>trophy/achievement you can unlock called "Dub and Dubber"</strong> by imitating the strangers as you film them. I had to imitate Corey, Dylan, and Nora before the trophy popped.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">There might be early opportunities I missed, but I got the last three strangers needed for the category recorded before the last part of the <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong> chapter. Once you're tasked with placing the stickers, head to the front of the bar to find three men walking out. Record each of them to complete the Strangers category</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Scenic_Views___4_collectibles_needed">Scenic Views - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611"></a><figcaption>Scenic View captured at the lake during Lights, Camera, Action!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Scenic views is a category that only requires four game environments to be recorded, but you'll have several opportunities to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of the scenic views can be captured during the chapter called <strong>Welcome to Velvet Cove</strong>.

This first-person horror game, which follows the final days of a shipwrecked space freighter crew, goes to some truly unsettling places. While Mouthwashing is only a few hours long, the chilling experience has really stuck with players, leading to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical acclaim</a> from critics and fans alike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGE8yrta8do" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tGE8yrta8do" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wrong Organ and Critical Reflex have confirmed that Mouthwashing has sold 500,000 copies since its release, an impressive feat for an indie game that flew under the radar prior to its release last September. Now that the game is a proven success, the developers are bringing Mouthwashing to consoles and even giving it a physical release.</p><p>While a specific date has not been shared yet, Mouthwashing will become available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S before the end of 2025. Physical editions of Mouthwashing PS5 and Nintendo Switch are also in the works, with preorders via Fangamer going live soon.</p><p>If you don't want to wait for Mouthwashing to come to consoles before playing it, you can buy it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$13 right now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nightreign-is-shaping-up-to-be-a-fast-and-frantic-take-on-elden-ring.1113627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A bunch of <em>Verge</em> staffers came back from the weekend chatting about our experiences with <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> network tests. We generally enjoyed the fast-paced, co-op-focused spin on <em>Elden Ring</em> that takes cues from roguelikes and battle royale games — and when things were good, they were <em>really</em> good. But we also ran into some frustrating connection issues that we worry could dampen the experience of the full game if they’re not worked out.</p><p>Read more about what we thought below. The game will be officially released on May 30th.</p><p>While playing the <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> network test, the word that kept coming to mind to describe it was “frantic.”</p><p>I played the original <em>Elden Ring</em> at a plodding pace. For every possible encounter, I cast spells from a distance as an astrologer to avoid the scary baddies, and I took advantage of numerous guides to find great gear and easy leveling spots.</p><p>I couldn’t do that with <em>Nightreign</em>; its constant, looming, battle royale-style closing ring of danger forces you to stay moving. The persistent threat of the storm meant I had to make quick decisions about which weapons to experiment with. To get runes to level up, I had to fight enemies head-on, and if I didn’t level up enough, I’d be useless against the fearsome bosses.</p><p>But despite <em>Nightreign</em> forcing me to play differently, I came to love the breakneck speed because of how it pushed me out of my comfort zone. And when I matched up with two other solid players, <em>Nightreign</em> was just awesome: I had a blast mowing through baddies and bosses with a coordinated group, especially when one team I played with easily took down a surprise Fell Omen spawn on the roof of a small keep.</p><p>I only just started to get the hang of <em>Nightreign</em> at the end of the network test. I can’t wait to jump into the full game and experiment with everything it has to offer, even if it means I have to keep being uncomfortable. <em>— Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><p>Like Jay, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign’s</em> pacing pushed me to play with haste and act braver than I normally do in The Lands Between. But I don’t always<em> want</em> to go that fast. </p><p>I enjoyed my drops into Limveld enough to play over five hours in total. The bulk of this came during the final play session when I partied up with two friends for three nonstop hours. We communicated via Discord to overcome the game’s lack of voice chat (an odd omission, though if the goal is to avoid player toxicity, I can understand it).</p><p>I really like the idea of a co-op <em>Elden Ring</em> that works well in short sessions. The battle royale format forces you to rush and encourages experimentation; with some buddies, it was an absolute thrill. At the same time, this game has no chill. There’s no casually hanging with the boys.</p><p>The trappings of a battle royale in a scaled-down <em>Elden Ring</em> world means you won’t be methodically exploring lengthy, exquisitely designed dungeons. That’s a bummer because to play with seamless co-op in the original game requires dealing with FromSoftware’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/is-elden-ring-co-op-multiplayer/">draconian restrictions</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">installing a mod on PC</a>. <em>Nightreign</em> is obviously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">designed with something else in mind</a>. <em>– Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer</em></p><p>I went into the <em>Nightreign</em> network test with no material history of playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and a bitter taste from my previous attempts at playing Soulslike games. But I was intrigued by the idea of playing the game with a team so we could carry each other through the unforgivably challenging hordes of monsters and bosses.</p><p>It turns out, I was always the one who needed the carrying.</p><p>My kind of fun usually doesn’t involve timely dodges and strategic spellcasting, but I did have a blast following people I’ve matched with who seemed to know what the hell they were doing. They took me all the way to the second day, and we died together against the Fell Omen. They must have revived my sad Wylder no less than 20 times.</p><p>I played the final network test window Sunday night with my colleague Sean Hollister, who is a pretty decent <em>Demon’s / Dark Souls </em>player and beat <em>Elden Ring</em>. We did have fun joking about how you need to smack a player while they’re down to revive them, frantically running away from those damn Flame Chariots, and wondering what our poor third teammate thought of us since they weren’t in our Discord.</p><p>I’m not sure if I’ll come back and play <em>Nightreign</em>. Maybe the menu system could be revamped so that it’s better designed for the fast-paced missions the game puts you through. But really, I just need to figure out how to duck, dip, dive, and dodge. <em>— Umar Shakir, news writer</em></p><p>I’ll admit: I don’t quite get it. Bite-sized co-op <em>Elden Ring</em>, yes, that sounds like an amazing idea. But why force it to fit inside the tired trappings of a battle royale game? The joy of <em>Souls</em> has always been cautious exploration, but now there’s a blue ring of creeping deadly fire keeping me from exploring it meaningfully and a “where we dropping boys?”-style intro to every mission rather than the mystical teleportation that has defined FromSoftware’s worlds. I just can’t feel that immersion when I’m inexplicably hacking at my buddy’s body to raise them when they’re downed — another trope of battle royale that just doesn’t make quite as much sense in a <em>Souls</em> world.</p><p>I <em>did</em> enjoy getting utterly trashed by the game with my colleague Umar — but if I could just as easily play co-op <em>Shadow of the Erdtree, </em>I’d be happier. — <em>Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><p>I’m really concerned about potential network stability and the overall communication issues in <em>Nightreign</em>. Though I didn’t get to play the network tests, during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">my playtests ahead of that</a>, connectivity issues were frequent and terrible. Based on what I’ve seen from players <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612986/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-be-testing-those-networks">and FromSoftware itself</a>, it seems like some of those issues have persisted.</p><p>Because we could never maintain a stable enough connection for all three members of the party, my team never managed to make it to the boss on the third day. It got so bad that, at one point, after I lost connection for the umpteenth time, I simply quit playing, contenting myself with walking around the testing area to watch others try to do what we couldn’t (and suffering connection issues as well).</p><p>On top of that, there’s no party chat in the game itself. I got around it because I could just talk to the two other players at my table. However, I wondered how randos would get over the lack of communication tools beyond emoting. You really don’t have time to pull up the emote wheel and select “Help me!” when the Fell Omen is chewing on your ass. <em>— Ash Parrish, games reporter</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while there have been several mods since Team Fortress 2 was launched in 2007, Valve has now released the game's entire source code, which may open the door to a lot of fan creations.</p><p>Valve made the announcement on <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2's official page</a>, while noting that the source code gives mods builders "the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions." However, this code is being shared on a non-commercial basis. This means that programmers won't be able to sell creations that were made from Team Fortress 2's foundations. However, the new fan-made mods can be listed in the Steam Store as free releases.</p><p>The line between professional game makers and modders has blurred over the years, and there are definitely talented fans who can probably work wonders, even with an 18-year-old game engine. In 2021, a group of modders took it upon themselves to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-modders-are-recreating-a-version-with-better-graphics-in-source-2/1100-6495075/" data-ref-id="1100-6495075">recreate Team Fortress 2 in Valve's Source 2 game engine</a>. It should be interesting to see if modders can push the Team Fortress 2 code into something that goes far beyond the scope of the original game.</p><p>Last year, players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">review-bombed Team Fortress 2</a> over the game's ongoing issues with bots, which have been a problem for a few years. Regardless, Valve has continued to offer some additional content for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">including new maps</a>, well after most publishers would have declared the title to be finished.</p>

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

			<p>Techland has announced that starting today, the Tower Raid roguelite co-op mode that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been tested since mid-2024</a> is now available permanently in Dying Light 2: Stay Human. This is part of the franchise's 10th anniversary celebrations and roadmap, which we dived into during <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-10th-anniversary-qa-with-franchise-director-tymon-smektala/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our recent interview with Techland's Tymon Smektala</a>.</p>
<p>In Tower Raid, Dying Light 2 players won't be playing as the game's regular protagonist, Aiden Caldwell. They will instead choose from four different characters, each belonging to a specific class archetype: Tank, Brawler, Ranger or Specialist. Each comes with their own unique set of skills. Players who really want a challenge may choose to go with a smaller squad than four, or even solo if they want to test themselves against the zombies.</p>
<p>There are three difficulty modes available: Quick, Normal and Elite. This choice affects the length of the session. Each run features a new mix of floors and challenges, ensuring a dynamic experience at every attempt at climbing the Tower.</p>
<p>The developers are also introducing a new progression system that was engineered to reward persistence through runs. With each failure, players unlock new skills and equipment to improve their chances on the challenging run. In the Tower Raid hub, players will also find Sola, a trader offering unique rewards such as the Office Day Outfit, the Kuai Dagger and the Silenced Pistol.</p>

<p>While this is a full release of Tower Raid in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Techland said it's actively seeking player feedback through the franchise's official social media channels (Facebook, X, Instagram), Discord and Reddit communities to further refine the gameplay experience. In addition, a special survey will be released in a few days to gather further insights from players.</p>
<p>As we learned in the aforementioned interview, the Polish developer still has big plans to update this game despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Summer launch window for the spin-off Dying Light: The Beast. Throughout 2025, Dying Light 2 is getting coop gameplay and matchmaking improvements, Community Map support improvements, new Tower Raid characters, new firearms and melee weapons, a new weapon class, further Prologue improvements, and graphical/technical improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Games and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that their survival drive-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game has officially passed the one million sales mark. That means it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">picked up another 400,000 sales</a> for itself since July last year, which definitely isn't too shabby for an indie studio like Ironwood.</p>

<p>As Ironwood itself says in the aforementioned press release, the studio has "less than 20 staff", and&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is its first game, which I think makes the game passing the million mark even more impressive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=lxix-O8t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-sales-1m-night.jpg?itok=xYMS8_GL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has passed the million mark in terms of sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you think Ironwood Studios is done with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, though, think again. The game has already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">received</a> three major updates since release, and the developer is teasing that the "fourth and most substantial update" will launch soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ironwood doesn't provide a specific release window for that update, so we could be waiting quite a while for it. Still, given that this isn't a live service game, it's nice to see the studio supporting it with any kind of post-launch plan.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s success means it's also caught the eye of Hollywood filmmaker James Wan, best known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Saw</em>. His <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">production company acquired the rights</a> to a&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show back in December.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's an indie survival game in which you must drive your car across the Olympic Exclusion Zone, foraging for resources and dodging anomalies as you go. If you can imagine&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Driver</em>, you're not far off.</p>




<p>The game is as much about repairing your car and making sure it runs alright as it is dodging the horrors of the Zone, so if you're in the market for a game that mixes vehicle maintenance with desperate struggles for your life, this is the one for you.</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/valve-releases-full-team-fortress-2-game-code-to-encourage-new-free-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Valve's updates to its classic games evoke Hemingway's two kinds of going bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. Nothing is heard, little is seen, and then, one day, <em>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Day of Defeat</em>, and other Source-engine-based games get a bevy of modern upgrades. Now, the entirety of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> (<em>TF2</em>) client and server game code, a boon for modders and fixers, is also being released.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013">source code</a> allows for more ambitious projects than have been possible thus far, <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve wrote in a blog post</a>. "Unlike the Steam Workshop or local content mods, this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend, or rewrite <em>TF2</em>, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible." The SDK license restricts any resulting projects to "a non-commercial basis," but they can be published on Steam's store as their own entities.</p>
<p>Since it had the tools out, Valve also poked around the games based on that more open source engine and spiffed them up as well. Most games got 64-bit binary support, scalable HUD graphics, borderless window options, and the like. Many of these upgrades come from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/valve-celebrates-25-years-of-half-life-with-feature-packed-steam-update/">the big 25-year anniversary update made to&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em></a>, which included "overbright lighting," gamepad configurations, Steam networking support, and the like.</p>

The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go.

The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>.

At this stage, we need to tap the 'generative AI isn't actually building video games' sign.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft stated that Muse, which was trained on data provided by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellblade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Ninja Theory, is currently capable of generating visuals at a resolution of 300 x 180 pixels. It also required 1 million training updates before producing a stable output featuring correct model behavior and mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft explained current instances of Muse have been trained on more than 1 billion images and controller actions, corresponding to over seven years of continuous human gameplay. It said that data was "ethically" sourced from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bleeding Edge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the four-versus-four multiplayer title developed by Ninja Theory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company had previously used player data from the title to drive human-like navigation experiments, but in 2022 apparently started wondering what might happen if that information was funneled into a machine learning model foie gras style. Thus, Muse was born.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the team got to work, some of the key challenges included scaling up the model training. We initially used a V100 cluster, where we were able to prove out how to scale up to training on up to 100 GPUs; that eventually paved the way to training at scale on H100s," said Microsoft, explaining how it birthed the technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Key design decisions we made early focused on how to best leverage insights from the large language model (LLM) community and included choices such as how to effectively represent controller actions and especially images."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microsoft heralds generative AI 'milestone' but Xbox studio head claims tech won't be used for content creation">Microsoft heralds generative AI 'milestone' but Xbox studio head claims tech won't be used for content creation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft described the development and unveiling of Muse as a "milestone" that perhaps demonstrates how generative AI models can "effectively support human creatives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, in one demo Muse was prompted with a modified visual featuring a completely new character.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-announces-ai-gameplay-generation-model-muse.1113531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-muse-ai-gameplay-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced Muse, a generative AI model that can "generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". The company is calling it the first example of a WHAM, or World and Human Action Model.</p>

<p>In a post on the official Microsoft website, the company reveals that Muse was developed in conjunction with <i>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</i>studio Ninja Theory. The model was trained on Ninja Theory's battle arena game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</p>

<p>A followup post on the Xbox website says Muse can "create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI", which Microsoft calls "a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators". I'm not so sure about that one myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=5FC-wPky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=EuWjQAMN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft trained its new AI on the Ninja Theory game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In both posts, Microsoft gives some examples of the kind of gameplay Muse is currently able to generate. Honestly, I might just not be infected by the tech brain worms, but to me it looks pretty low-quality.</p>

<p>It's not just me, either; The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms</a> that Muse is currently only capable of generating gameplay at a paltry 300 x 180 resolution, and not only that, but it's also limited to 10 frames per second. Find me a PC gamer that would be happy with those numbers.</p>

<p>I know, I know. The tech is still in its early stages, and I'm sure that Microsoft will be able to iterate on it in order to create a model that can convincingly generate higher-resolution gameplay at a better frame rate.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I'm still left wondering what the point of it all is. According to Microsoft, it's all about "effectively support[ing] human creatives" and that potential applications include "the opportunity to make older games accessible to future generations of players across new devices and in new ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=NnujBJSC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=YO5dc2Vt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Generative AI is popping up in games like Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>From a cynical perspective, though, I can only really see companies looking for ways to cut out human developers and replace them with AI processes once the tech becomes even remotely viable for doing so.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">colossal environmental impact of AI</a>, which doesn't appear to be mentioned in either of the aforementioned Microsoft posts, nor (ironically) in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nature article</a> in which the Muse research paper is contained.</p>

<p>Still, if you'd like to read about Microsoft's new Muse model and get some of the nerdy details about how it works, you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>.

The developers did not give a reason for the layoffs, which came as a shock to the gaming community because of Rivals’ evident success. However, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, NetEase has clarified that the reason was organizational streamlining.</p><p>“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game,” wrote Alex Armour, a PR representative from NetEase Games. “This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.”</p><p>The statement continued by reassuring fans that development on <em>Rivals</em> would continue with a core group of developers based in China. “We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game.”</p><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">According to a report in <em>VentureBeat</em></a> though, organizational streamlining doesn’t give the full picture of what’s going on, with sources claiming the real reason for the layoffs is that NetEase executives are no longer confident in overseas development teams. The success of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em> has apparently proven to NetEase that blockbuster hits can be made cheaper and closer to home without the need for expensive overseas teams in Europe and America. </p><p>In a statement to <em>VentureBeat</em>, NetEase denied claims that it intends to retreat from overseas development and that the layoffs in Seattle only represent a small portion of its holdings abroad. “Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects.”</p><p>NetEase declined to detail the exact scope of the Seattle layoffs which come just two months after <em>Marvel Rivals</em> launched to rapid critical and financial success with reports estimating that it raised over $130 million in revenue in its first month.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I can never remember the technical term for that wibbly effect you get in PS1 games when you sidle up to surfaces and look askance at the textures. I thought it was "dithering", but Brendy says that's not what dithering is you sap, you absolute dunce. If you know the answer, please educate me in a comment. But first, try Blue Wyrm.</p>
<p>It's a free first-person melee dungeon crawler from SaintPesticide. It's awash with rich, diseased shades of ruby, amethyst and malachite. And brother, it has not-dithering to spare. Here's a video.

In Blue Wyrm you play the Red Knight Gabriel, who is trying to rescue her wife, the Blue Knight Lucia, from a crypt populated by hissing marionettes, green diamonds and photon-spitting sentries. Gabriel is equipped with a sword that handles like an oversized ice pick, tinking off surfaces in a musical way. She can swipe left and right or stab forward by pressing the left, right and mouse-wheel buttons respectively. If you chain together all three kinds of attack in a single combo, you'll leach health from the body of your assailant.
</p>
<p>
This is vital, because Gabriel ain't so hot at defending. She's a fast runner and she can double-jump, but she can't dodge, parry or block. Or at least, these abilities were not available in the 20 minutes I spent with the Itch build, during which I spent a lot of time cooing over the fittings. Blue Wyrm is a gorgeous piece of work, the kind of lurid imagineering that blows the dust from senses deadened by overmuch photorealism. Calling it "PS1-esque" bleaches away the specificity. That said, I <em>really</em> need to see this running on a CRT.
</p>

You can download Blue Wyrm <a href="https://saintpesticide.itch.io/blue-wyrm">here</a>. SaintPesticide is <a href="https://saintpesticide.itch.io/">also the creator</a> of visual novels, top-down shooters and "spirit cutting puzzles".

<p>Elon Musk recently expressed his intention to ‘make video games great again’ on the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022. It has been just a few weeks since Elon Musk admitted to cheating in games like Path of Exile and Diablo, and despite being a contributor to problematic areas of the industry, he now intends to found an AI-powered dev studio.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the ‘xAI’ profile invited users to email in to chase jobs revolving around ‘designing AI games first principles’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-potential-is-incredible">‘The Potential is Incredible’</h2>



<p>Elon Musk was aired out a couple of weeks ago for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">cheating by sharing his accounts</a> in Path of Exile and Diablo. He didn’t care about the revelation going public, and now he has decided to single-handedly save the gaming industry, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891396362404565341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaning on the quip</a> made famous by his new best friend, President Donald Trump:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s got to be done. </p>



<p>Make video games great again!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Trump, Musk lacks originality in the attempted coining of that phrase. The billionaire tech titan made this comment in response to a post suggesting that he’s ‘fed up with woke politics and DEI destroying the games industry’.</p>



<p>And of course, these comments came days after Musk branded games journalism as ‘garbage’. And to think I once branded him one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/">most successful streamers in history</a>!</p>



<p>Musk followed up today with <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892087111055974879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another bold statement</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join us to make revolutionary video games using AI. </p>



<p>The potential for a dynamically generated video game using AI is incredible!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many users commented on these posts hoping that the use of AI would be confined to ‘backend processes’ to better automate a human-led development ecosystem, but that’s probably not the case. Elon Musk is no stranger to cleaning house and stripping teams down to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, the space-mad, eccentric billionaire would probably have Grok manufacture entire games at the press of a button. The scary thing is, that he’s surrounded by such capable people that it’s probably not too far from becoming a reality.</p>



<p>What do you think about Elon Musk’s desire to ‘make gaming great again?’ Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The WHAM, Katja Hofmann, Senior Principal Research Manager and lead of the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence team, said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, is a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft calls this generative AI model Muse, which was developed by the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence and Teachable AI Experiences (Tai X) teams in collaboration with Hellblade developer Ninja Theory. It’s open sourcing the weights and sample data and making the executable available for the WHAM Demonstrator — a concept prototype that provides a visual interface for interacting with WHAM models and multiple ways of prompting the models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company provided a number of gameplay clips showing what Muse is capable of. Currently, the model can generate “complex gameplay sequences that are consistent over several minutes” just by prompting the model with 10 initial frames (one second) of human gameplay and the controller actions of the whole play sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game used to train Muse was Ninja Theory’s 2020 multiplayer game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. “We worked closely with our colleagues at Ninja Theory and with Microsoft compliance teams to ensure that the data was collected ethically and used responsibly for research purposes,” Hofmann insisted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/wham-gen-2-1739980350168.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Muse was trained on Bleeding Edge, and early results look very close.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s been amazing to see the variety of ways Microsoft Research has used the Bleeding Edge environment and data to explore novel techniques in a rapidly moving AI industry,” said Gavin Costello, technical director at Ninja Theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From the hackathon that started it all, where we first integrated AI into Bleeding Edge, to building AI agents that could behave more like human players, to the World and Human Action Model being able to dream up entirely new sequences of Bleeding Edge gameplay under human guidance, it’s been eye-opening to see the potential this type of technology has.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muse is used in “world model mode” meaning it is used to predict how the game will evolve from the initial prompt sequence. The more closely the generated gameplay sequence resembles the actual game, the more accurately Muse has captured the dynamics of that game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/wham-gen-1-1739980217611.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An example of what Muse is currently capable of.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest and most controversial topics in the creative industries. As video game development costs rise, publishers are increasingly looking to AI tools to speed up work and cut costs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Call of Duty reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic" for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> in late 2023, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">fans accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen last year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>, and just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything">weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is all-in on generative AI, as anyone with even a cursory knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI will be aware of, and so this development with Ninja Theory comes as little surprise. Still, the company will face tough questions from some within the video game development community who are worried models like Muse will put them out of a job.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the blog post, Hofmann insisted that Microsoft's team “focus on exploring the capabilities that models like Muse need to effectively support human creatives.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look forward to seeing the many ways in which the community will explore these models and build on our research," Hofmann continued. "I cannot wait to see all the ways that these models and subsequent research will help shape and increase our understanding of how generative AI models of human gameplay may support gameplay ideation and pave the way for future, novel, AI-based game experiences, including the use cases that our colleagues at Xbox have already started to explore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
