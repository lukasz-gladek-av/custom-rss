		<p>Creepy Jar has showcased the environment of StarRupture, its upcoming sci-fi survival game. The environment of StarRupture is highly inspired by one environment that is mostly untouched by people, and that is the nation of Iceland. Creepy Jar has used Iceland’s natural landscape to create the foundation of StarRupture’s hostile world.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - Environment Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rklKZ1tNQUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase delves into how Iceland inspired the look of the game due to having a near prehistoric look and feel to it. The video also shows how resources are shown in the StarRupture, for example titanium has been given the shape of basalt rock columns, and given a shine inspired by other materials. Even with such a hostile natural environment, life does thrive in StarRupture with plants and animals adapting to the unstable world. The majority of the animals will be especially hostile to players, though a few will not pose any real danger. The planet in StarRupture is littered with remnants from previous expeditions, none of which survived the harsh conditions that they came up against. Those remnants include abandoned bases which contain resources that were left behind.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. Players will be able to play solo or up to four player co-op. As well as dealing with the weather issues the planet, the fauna will attack and be a threat to player progress. There will be regular cycles of attacks, and it will be about learning on how to deal with those threats to make the base more resilient.</p>

<p>A release date for StarRupture is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/DavideSoliani/status/1816050633343938597" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a> earlier today, Soliani shared a shot of the famous moment of him crying during E3 2017 when&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-e3-2017-mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle">was first announced</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say about his tenure with Ubisoft and his plans for the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all folks. After 25 years, 11 of which beautifully spent working with Nintendo on Mario+Rabbids along the company of our incredible community of players, I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure. I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly.</p>

<p>Soliani served as the creative director on both 2017's&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&nbsp;</em>and its excellent sequel, 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope"><em>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</em></a>, but that's not all he did while at Ubisoft, of course.</p>
<p>His credits also include work as a creative director on&nbsp;<em>Just Dance</em>, as well as level design for 2005's GameCube action-strategy game&nbsp;<em>Battalion Wars&nbsp;</em>and even a credit on influential action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>.</p>
<p>It's safe to say he's one of Ubisoft's lifers, so his decision to leave the company will probably be a blow for many at the studio, although whether it's a surprise or not is another question.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-davide-soliani-ubisoft.jpg?itok=HfA0cLzH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-davide-soliani-ubisoft.jpg?itok=cNU7mMfV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Davide Soliani has credits on lots of Ubisoft games, including&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's done a lot of work with Ubisoft behind the scenes, he's perhaps best known for a viral moment in 2017 when he cried during the unveiling of&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>As Shigeru Miyamoto took to the stage to introduce the game, cameras cut to Soliani, who was weeping, most likely out of a mixture of happiness and relief that his game was finally out there. Well, Davide, you needn't worry; they're both great games, and your legacy is secure.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Davide Soliani does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/is-game-pass-underperforming-</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-game-pass-underperforming.935451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/is-game-pass-underperforming-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the defining changes in media in the 21st century - perhaps the defining change - is the switch to on-demand subscription services for most of our video and audio entertainment. This change isn’t just dramatic, it’s seemingly inevitable. Now that we have the technology to do this, the idea of going back to individual purchases of all music and movies feels just like that - going backwards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was only natural then, to expect that something similar would happen in the gaming space. And sure enough, some of the big players have tried to become the Netflix of gaming, including Microsoft, Apple, and of course, Netflix themselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a player, I’m a fan of these. I have on several occasions suggested that Game Pass specifically is the best value in gaming. But over 5 years later, it’s clear that the service hasn’t taken off to the extent they might have hoped, leading to the narrative that it’s underperforming or a failure.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The state of game subs">The state of game subs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recent reports have Game Pass subscribers at somewhere around 34 million, which is simultaneously a large sounding number and a small fraction of the total Xbox and PC gamers. Consider that there are an estimated 120M+ monthly users of Steam, and that Steam doesn’t include Fortnite, League of Legends, Roblox, Minecraft and other titles that may boast more than that 34M figure by themselves. This slower than expected growth is being cited as a key reason for Microsoft’s recent studio closures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A recent tweet by Circana’s Mat Piscatella reported that “non-mobile video game subscription spending was only up 1%” vs the previous year. That’s a tiny increase for what seemed like it could be the next big thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the mobile side, things are a bit murkier. Subscriber counts for Apple Arcade are a little harder to come by, and due to the inclusion of Apple Arcade within the broader Apple One package, they may represent an overcount of the number of real users if we did have them. Similarly, Netflix technically offers games to all of its several hundred million users, but since it comes bundled in with the existing video subscription, that number represents only the number that have access to their game catalog, not those using it or those aware it even exists. Data from Apptopia put the number of players on a daily basis somewhere in the ballpark of 2M.</span></p><p>Source: https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1787873505092202867</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So what happened?">So what happened?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the ubiquity of streaming in music and video and the time these services have been available, a couple of potential explanations jump out. Either</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They just haven’t gotten the quality or quantity of titles required to convince most gamers to sign up.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The discussions about this performance are based on a flawed assumption.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While I can’t rule out A, I suspect B is more likely, and I’m going to make an attempt to explain what I think that flawed assumption is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Two types of game">Two types of game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To start with, let me ask a seemingly simple question: are games a form of media? The obvious answer is “Yes”, but a more nuanced answer would be “They </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>can</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be”. One of the biggest trends over the past couple of decades has been the rise of games specifically designed to be played for a potentially endless amount of time. The audience for these titles do not really treat “gaming” as a hobby so much as they treat individual games as a hobby.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This change can be seen in a variety of ways:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several popular game genres that now exist primarily as ‘forever games’ - MMO’s, MOBA’s, Battle Royale’s, etc. Many of these have subscription models built in, be it mandatory monthly subs or optional battle passes.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost the entire field of mobile F2P games, with the exception of the hyper-casual space, is now designed to be played for as long as possible. To give an extreme example, the immensely popular Candy Crush Saga now has over 15,000 levels. Most successful games have regular events, clan functionality, daily challenges, and a host of other features intended to make a game into a core part of your week. Many (most?) of the top mobile games these days have their own subscription model, though usually just as one payment option of many.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost the entire concept of e-sports, which usually relies on both a player base of competitors committed to mastery of a single game and an audience who also know the game well enough to appreciate the skills on display and to care enough about who is the best in the world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game-As-Platform model exemplified by games like Roblox and more recently Fortnite, where a single game launcher actually contains a variety of game experiences, such that one title can become a catalog of games in and of itself.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even the rise of Twitch and related services, letting you watch your favorite game even when you can’t be playing it.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So while games certainly can be a form of media, not all gamers treat them as something to be consumed like media. Ironically, despite this article being about subscriptions to catalog services, subscriptions to individual games have actually done very well. Wold of Warcraft alone reportedly peaked at over 10M subscribers, putting it potentially around ⅓ of Game Pass by itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amongst all these trends, there may have only been one clear trend in the other direction, and that’s in the independent scene. Not all independent devs of course, but prior to the last decade, it was unusual to see smaller teams competing for Game of the Year awards, whereas now that’s fairly common, and most of those tend much more to the experiential side.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, as you can probably tell from the words being used in this blog, there still aren’t commonly agreed upon terms for these two types of game, nor does any store (to my knowledge) let you search or filter by one or the other. All of which continues to make it easy to conflate them and overlook the importance of this distinction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The size of the market">The size of the market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To rephrase the above, the core problem of selling monthly access to a catalog of videogames is the sheer number of gamers who simply aren’t looking for new game experiences every month. There may well be hundreds of millions of people who played a videogame today, but let’s start chipping away at that figure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the people who just play F2P games and don’t spend a cent on anything? They’re probably not potential customers, and I’d guess that this group could number in the hundreds of millions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And all the ones who do routinely spend money in F2P games? They’re typically quite committed to those games, and hence probably not the kind that are looking to jump from game to game on a regular basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ditto for the competitive gamers who want to find a game - be it FPS/RTS/MOBA/CCG/etc - that they can commit to for long enough to develop mastery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Really, if any game in your Steam library has a playtime of over 500 hours, you may be getting enough value from the games you buy that a catalog service actually becomes worse value by comparison.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyone who just wants to play the biggest AAA games of the year will likely be ruled out too - there’s just not that many exceptional ones per year these days, and they’re spread across too many publishers and platforms to get a significant number on one service. Others may arrive later, but at this point I think Microsoft and Ubisoft are the only traditional publishers launching their biggest titles on day one on [the higher tiers of] their services, something Sony has thus far declined to do for their PSN Extra/Deluxe tiers. So this kind of player may be a potential customer, but may also lean towards signing up occasionally for limited time periods rather than being an ongoing customer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, fans of indie games may also want to play whatever notable releases arrive in their favourite genres (or just anything getting enough buzz), but again, if you want to be part of the zeitgeist then you may also not be fully satisfied with this combination of occasional day 1 releases and semi-random older choices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what you’re left with is players who want to play a wide variety of games, either by indies or whatever back catalog premium titles are currently on rotation, and aren’t getting so distracted by other off-service titles to find the subscription service unnecessary. Oh and they also need to have access to the platform(s) your service runs on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How big is this market? I have no idea. We’d need some far more experienced analysts to dive into that one. But I feel fairly comfortable saying that it’s likely nowhere near as big as the overall size of the gaming market might suggest. And it likely pales next to the largest single titles as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This concept of total addressable market is very important to the perceptions of success or failure, because if you hear that Microsoft are only reaching ~34 million of the multiple billion gamers, then it’s easy to conclude that it’s underperforming. But if you think that the number of people who might be interested in such a service might stretch to only around 100M, then they may have already reached around a third of the entire market. In most industries that’d likely be considered pretty good for a few years work at a new business model.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why this goes unnoticed">Why this goes unnoticed</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the reason this often goes undercovered in much of the gaming press is that the gaming press is comprised of people who need to be jumping from game to game on a weekly basis as part of their job. As a result, even if they do have their forever game that they can keep going back to, they also need to enjoy playing a variety of games every month or they likely wouldn’t be doing what they are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are of course people who specialise in covering a single game, though I suspect it’d be a fairly rare scenario that there was enough to say about a game that launched over 3 years ago to keep a gaming journalist employed full time, even if there were still 10M people playing that game. All of which leads to a strong focus on what’s new and upcoming over what the majority of players are actually spending their time on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the market for gaming journalism is mostly the section that cares about what’s new and novel. And as discussed above, this section represents only a tiny portion of the total gaming market, and it may not be growing fast, if it’s growing at all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it is the segment of the market that’s most likely to be found regularly reading the gaming press or listening to their podcasts, so it’s natural to think of it as being more representative of the gaming landscape as a whole than it really is. And therefore to think that because their audience would likely appreciate a large selection of high-quality games for a reasonable monthly fee, that there must be a very large market for such a thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it may still be a niche, as hard as that may be to believe.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The wrong solution">The wrong solution</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the face of these perceived shortfalls, an inevitable solution will be proposed - that the service needs to expand into the kinds of games that can hold onto players for months or years. This can be seen both in Microsoft’s addition of bonuses for several of Riot’s F2P games on Game Pass, and in Apple’s reported pivot of the criteria they’re looking for in Apple Arcade titles. These notions, while understandable, may be missing the point. They’re understandable because, as discussed already, we know that there are types of games that can hang onto players for months or longer, and a game subscription service that had such a game might be able to keep someone resubscribing every month in the same way that a must-watch television series might keep subscribers around for the length of the season.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But they’re potentially missing the point because, also as suggested above, these can be exactly the kinds of games that can monetise on an ongoing basis all by themselves. And a game that can get a large player base to commit to even $5 a month directly probably stands to make a lot more than it could as 1 of several hundred games on a $10-15 monthly subscription.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is one area where games are unique from the other media types. Movies and music can certainly get one-off revenue from a number of sources, but I don’t know how many musicians or film directors ever aspired to reliably make $15 a month from over 10 million fans as World of Warcraft did.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, any player who did find themselves primarily playing a single game on a subscription service might naturally start to wonder why they’re paying for hundreds of other games if they’re mostly just playing one, and could be supporting that single dev directly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given my rambling nature, there’s a few things to summarise here, but I’m going to focus on one in particular -&nbsp; we need better labels for the variety of experiences games can offer. I have to believe that few people would treat movies, TV shows and Tiktok videos the same, despite all being video-based entertainment options. Spotify doesn’t treat music, podcasts and audiobooks the same, despite all being audio-based entertainment options. And I think gaming provides a similar breadth of forms, though we lack the language to differentiate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The closest any store I can recall has come to this distinction is the paid/free split on the mobile app stores, though I don’t think either has really done anything to explain what the differences are between premium and F2P games, nor does it do anything to separate F2P games from just plain free games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After spending a little time pondering a few ideas for naming, I think the most logical options would simply be ‘finite games’ and ‘infinite games’, though perhaps some creators may wish to declare that they make finite games that just happen to take a year to finish, by which time they hope to have added even more content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such terms could help everyone in the gaming space. They would help developers better communicate what they’re making. They would help players understand what they’re playing or what they’re in the market for. And for the purposes of this blog, it would help analysts and the rest of us better quantify the size of various segments of the overall market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ideally, any catalogue service listing ‘finite games’ should also list an estimated playtime, in the same way that every video and audio service tells you the length of what you’re about to see or hear. Such times may have to include vague min/max figures to account for the variety of different experiences, but not only is this possible, Microsoft are already doing it on Game Pass through the HowLongToBeat data. Some worried that this would limit the reach of shorter titles, but I suspect the opposite might be true - from personal experience, once you have an ‘all-you-can-eat’ model, you develop a new respect for games that haven’t been padded out to meet some arbitrary hours-per-dollars metric. If you’re unsure about a game, knowing that it’ll only take a few hours either way can be a lot more encouraging than hearing a game gets really good after the first dozen hours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Addendum">Addendum</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of this blog was written before MS announced the recent pricing and feature changes for the Game Pass tiers, but I don’t think anything above fundamentally changes. If anything, it may serve as an explanation for a possible strategy change. Remember the $1 trial month? That’s a thing you do when growing your audience is more important than short-term profit. Upping the prices and forcing players to upgrade to the top tier for what used to be the marketing slogan of your service (“Play it day one with Game Pass”) is something you do when you think that the smarter play is extracting more revenue from your existing users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Robert Green is a game designer with 19 years experience making games across a wide variety of genres and platforms.

<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.none_original_image" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="085e0477-0abb-4a52-8ff5-32c7890441f8" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>Coming from Dark Horse Comics, a publication company responsible for all kinds of video game related books and comics, including a similar art book for 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition, "The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard" will likely feature official game art, concept art, and more. That's just a guess for now, though – we'll have to wait to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://subscription.gameinformer.com/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard graced the cover of our last&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://subscription.gameinformer.com/">Game Informer</a>&nbsp;</em>issue. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard">You can check that out here</a>, and in case you missed it,&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>has an entire <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/DragonAgeTheVeilguard">hub</a> full of exclusive details about the game from our visit to BioWare earlier this year. There, you'll find deep dives into companions, behind-the-scenes features, interviews with some of the leads of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and much more.

			<p>Yesterday, news broke out that the entire dev team behind Humble Games was laid off. This information came from employees working at the company and posted it on their LinkedIn accounts. <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senior QA Emilee Kieffer</a> made the post across Linkedin and their X account to explain the situation. Humble Games is responsible for publishing well-known indie games, such as Unpacking, Slay the Spire, and Coral Island.</p>
<p>However, despite yesterday's statements by the laid-off staff, Humble Games has since made a statement that they did not lay off the entire team but are "restructuring" the company and will not be closing down. According to Emilee Kieffer, in a post on X, roughly 40 staff members were laid off from the Humble Games team. However, the numbers regarding how many staff were made redundant have not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>"In these challenging economic times for indie publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects," says a Humble Bundle Press representative in an official statement.</p>
<p>The statement also confirms that Humble Games' restructuring will have no effect on Humble Bundle and that it will resume operations as usual. The statement also says, "We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017."</p>
<p>Humble Games also has <a href="https://www.humblegames.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming projects</a> like Lost Skies, On Your Tail, and Monaco II. What will happen with these projects, whether the developers will have to find different publishers for the games, and whether the projects can continue as normal remains unseen.</p>
<p>In the past year alone, 11,000 people have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-home-qa-keoken-talks-studio-layoffs-kickstarter-campaign-and-life-as-a-small-indie/">laid off</a> across the gaming industry, surpassing the numbers of 2023, with 10,500 people being laid off across the entire year. Most of the layoffs of 2024 thus far happened at the very early beginning of the year, quickly surpassing those in 2023.</p>
<p>It remains unknown whether IGN Entertainment will make a statement on the layoffs at the moment, as they purchased Humble Games in 2017, what this means for the future of Humble Bundle as a whole, and whether this will eventually affect Humble Bundle.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-release-date-revealed.935421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grasshopper Manufacture has announced the&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>release date, and it won't be too long before you get to play this star-studded cult classic on modern systems.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>arrives on October 31st, which feels like a pretty appropriate release date for a game as spooky as this one.</p>
<p>In case you need a refresher, the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2011, and it's got a serious all-star team behind it; the game was co-produced by&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>'s Shinji Mikami and co-written by&nbsp;<em>Killer7&nbsp;</em>creator Suda51, and it sports a soundtrack created by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-release-date-monster.jpg?itok=OO1UwyR7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-release-date-monster.jpg?itok=JQBnUnsd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2011's&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is making a return this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The game sees demon hunter Garcia Hotspur (yes, really) journeying into the City of the Damned in order to save his girlfriend and battle the improbably-named Fleming, Lord of the Demons.</p>
<p>He's assisted in his endeavors by Johnson, a shapeshifting demon skull who can turn into a gun, a motorcycle, and a torch, among other things. It's not a bad gig to have if you can get it.</p>
<p>Gameplay revolves around doing battle with a variety of different demons, as well as solving puzzles themed around light or spotting a goat's head to shoot in order to open a door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, which gives a sense of what kind of work Grasshopper has been doing to modernize its game, right here.</p>

<p>The remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-announced-by-grasshopper-manufacture-grasshopper-direct">announced back in June last year</a>, and shortly after that, Grasshopper <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-coming-to-all-current-platforms-probably-as-suda51-teases">confirmed</a> it would come to "all modern platforms".</p>
<p>That does indeed seem to be the case, as&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535440/Shadows_of_the_Damned_Hella_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10008909" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shadows-of-the-damned/c136m2366dm0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In addition to turning iOS and Android smartphones into handheld consoles not dependent on finicky touchscreen controls, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesir.hk%2Fproducts%2Fg8plus-bluetooth-mobile-controller">new GameSir G8 Plus</a> can replace the Switch’s Joy-Cons with more ergonomic alternatives that will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">never succumb to joystick drift</a>.</p><p>Unlike many clamp-on gaming controllers for mobile devices that physically connect through a USB-C or Lightning port, the GameSir G8 Plus uses Bluetooth. That’s what allows it to connect to smartphones, tablets, the Switch, and even PCs without requiring users to pick a version with a specific connector.</p><p>The tradeoff is that the gamepad relies on a pair of 500mAh&nbsp;rechargeable batteries. That makes it one more accessory you’ll need to remember to charge, and one that will add almost 314 grams to whatever you clamp it to.</p><p>The GameSir G8 Plus also features drift-resistant Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and analog triggers, ensuring gamers will never experience unwanted button presses or movements. The triggers can be switched to a “Hair Trigger Mode” making them more responsive for FPS players.</p><p>Motion controls are supported thanks to a six-axis gyroscope, while haptic feedback is provided by a pair of vibration motors. The G8 Plus can even wake the Switch with a single button press, which is a feature that many third-party controllers don’t offer.</p><div><figcaption><em>Gamers can customize the G8 Plus using interchangeable magnetic faceplates and swappable button caps.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: GameSir</cite></p></div><p>The controller’s clamping mechanism can expand to 215 millimeters to accommodate larger smartphones and tablets like the iPad Mini. It’s also customizable with magnetic faceplates that easily pop off and swappable caps for the joysticks and face buttons. It’s a nice feature for gamers who like to personalize their hardware, but only when alternative faceplates are actually available. The company says those are still in planning.</p><div><figcaption><em>The mobile controller can be used to play PC games over Bluetooth or directly connected with a USB-C cable for less lag.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: GameSir</cite></p></div><p>Bluetooth support allows the GameSir G8 Plus to connect to a PC and be used as a standalone wireless controller without a mobile device attached. Gamers wanting less lag can instead opt for a direct connection to a computer using a USB-C cable.</p><p>The GameSir G8 Plus is available now for $79.99. That’s cheaper than the $99.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a> and the same price as a pack of replacement Joy-Cons that can potentially still develop joystick drift.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-adding-way-to-save-power-when-charging-controllers-but-only-for-latest-ps5-model<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sony has detailed its a fresh wave of PlayStation 5 features set to be tested as part of its next system software beta update. 
</p>
<p>
This will include "adaptive charging", designed to save power if you have plugged in controllers to charge while your console is in rest mode.
</p>
<p>
The feature can monitor charge levels in any plugged-in pads and adjust the power supplied to their connected USB ports appropriately.  
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Newscast: Does the loss of day one launches make Xbox Game Pass pointless?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEc8ghseTIk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
You can also switch off power to any unused USB ports completely after a period of time, or after a set number of hours. 
</p>
<p>
When in rest mode, Sony says your PS5 consumes more than 2W of power when charging controllers. With USB ports switched off and an additional setting to disconnect from the internet enabled, you can reduce that down to 0.5W.
</p>
<p>
It's a smart feature, and one which might help you save a little on your energy usage. But it's only available for the latest PS5 model - the one formally announced last October, with the option of the detachable hard drive. 
</p>
<p>
Likewise, you'll need to be charging an official DualSense wireless controller, DualSense Edge wireless controller, PlayStation VR2 Sense controller or Access controller to make use of this. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the beta, you can now personalise 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds, and adjust Remote Play settings per user. 
</p>
<p>
These latest features go into beta testing tomorrow, following the general <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-ps5-update-adds-shareable-links-to-quickly-jump-into-multiplayer-games">launch of Sony's last PS5 system software update this week</a> which added shareable links to quickly jump into multiplayer games.

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DavideSoliani/status/1816050633343938597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Mario+Rabbids veteran Davide Soliani announced they are leaving Ubisoft after 25 years.</p>



<p>Soliani thanked the “incredible community of players,” and explained they left Ubisoft “to embark on a new adventure.” At this time, they did not elaborate on the details of their plans.</p>



<p>Soliani served as the creative director on Mario+ Rabbids Kingdom Battle and the most recent Mario+ Rabbids Sparks of Hope. </p>



<p>Overall, Soliani worked on the Mario+Rabbids series for 11 years. Gaming fans might also recognize Soliani for their tender moment at the 2017 E3 event. </p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi all folks. After 25 years, 11 of which beautifully spent working with Nintendo on Mario+Rabbids along the company of our incredible community of players, I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure. I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly 🙏❤️ <a href="https://t.co/nafgBC2bu8">pic.twitter.com/nafgBC2bu8</a></p>— Davide Soliani (@DavideSoliani) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavideSoliani/status/1816050633343938597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1816057815812730978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promptly replied</a> to Soliani via X, with “best wishes for the worlds you’ll journey through next.” Soliani worked at Ubisoft Milan in Italy. Although many fans are disappointed by his exit, there is excited support for Soliani and their future projects.</p>



<p>Mario+Rabbids Kingdom Battle first launched in 2017, while Sparks of Hope released in 2022. </p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Nintendo also briefly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-is-now-free-for-nintendo-switch-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered a free trial</a> of Mario+Rabbids Sparks of Hope for Nintendo Switch Online users. Years later, Sparks of Hope still maintains strong ratings on Metacritic, currently boasting a 7.5 user score. </p>



<p>Mario fans can still look forward to Super Mario Party Jamboree, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-can-pre-order-super-mario-party-jamboree-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders are available now</a>. During the latest Nintendo Direct showcase, Nintnedo also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-luigi-brothership-announced-for-november-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership</a> for November 7, 2024.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has updated its policy on sexual harassment, and added a new category to its AutoMod tool, to improve safety on its platform.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/How-We-re-Combatting-Sexual-Harassment-on-Twitch?language=en_US">new blog post</a> titled "How we're combatting sexual harassment on Twitch", the streaming platform highlights clarifications to its policy.
</p>
<p>
"While our policy remains largely unchanged, these updates are designed to make the policy easier to understand," it reads. "Sexual harassment is never okay or acceptable. It harms our community, can make those targeted feel unsafe and disrespected, and can discourage them and others from participating on Twitch. We want our service to be the best and safest place to stream, and that means drawing clear boundaries around what behaviours are and aren't allowed."
</p>
<figure>

<p>

To that end, additional language has been added to Twitch's sexual harassment policy, which defines sexual harassment as follows:
</p>
<p>
"We define sexual harassment to encompass non-physical behaviors of a sexual nature that cause users to feel uncomfortable, degraded, unsafe, or discouraged from participation. We prohibit unwanted comments-including comments made using emojis/emotes-regarding someone's appearance or body, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification, and negative statements or attacks related to a person's perceived sexual behaviours or activities, regardless of their gender. We also do not tolerate the recording or sharing of non-consensual intimate images or videos under any circumstances, and may report such content to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
In addition, the AutoMod tool - which automatically detects potentially harmful messages for mod review - now has a specific sexual harassment filter to help remove "unwelcome comments about someone's appearance, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification". It's currently only available in English.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's a timely addition for Twitch, which has faced criticism following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">an admission by high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that led to his ban from the platform. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-continued-to-send-sexually-explicit-messages-to-minor-after-their-age-was-known-former-twitch-employee-says">Later reports claimed he sent sexually explicit images</a> even after the age of the minor was known.


</p>
<p>
Of course, it should be noted these messages were in 2017 and Beahm was banned in 2020, so much has changed in the time since, with Twitch continuing to update its community guidelines and improve safety.
</p>
<p>
After attending <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">TwitchCon Europe this year</a>, a Twitch spokesperson emphasised to Eurogamer the importance of safety.

</p>
<p>
"Harassment has no place on Twitch, and we take enforcement of our harassment and hateful conduct policies seriously," said a Twitch spokesperson, detailing a number of features used to promote safety including Automod, Shield Mode, and follower verification. "These tools, in addition to our ongoing, 24/7 content moderation, help prevent harassment on Twitch. We continue to build on this work."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-update-104-tweaks-popular-valby-run-farming-method<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a> developer Nexon has released update 1.0.4 across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S alongside the <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2608718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, below.</p><p>The patch tweaks the popular ‘Valby run’ farming method. Set in The Fortress Outpost on hard mode, the Valby run involves destroying generators and damaging the boss enough to trigger its ball immune phase, then using the character Valby’s ability to deal continuous damage while moving around the outer ring of the arena in an endless loop. With the Valby run farming method, players were able to gain hundreds of thousands of in-game gold and loads of XP in just a few minutes.</p><h2>The First Descendant update 1.0.4 patch notes in full:</h2><p><strong>Content Improvements</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Module storage limit has been increased from 1,000 to 1,500.</li><li>Cooldown for "Vulgus Strategic Outpost" has been reduced from five minutes to one minute.</li><li>Spawning time between monster respawn has been increased, and the reward amount has been adjusted at the "Vulgus Strategic Outpost."</li><li>Void Fragments will now drop when defeating monsters in Special Operation. There will be the most void fragment drops at the Special Operation "Neutralize Void Experiment."</li><li>Using "Mark for Arrest" item obtained from Special Operation will grant 10 times the usual amount of gold. When "Mark for Arrest" is used from ‘consumable’ tab, it will convert to 100,000 gold, and "High-Value Mark for Arrest" will convert to 1,000,000 gold.</li></ul><p>“With this adjustment, the reward amount at Fortress outpost has been reduced,” The First Descendant director Joo Min-seok explained.</p><p>“However, to ensure that ‘Valby run’ remains a popular hunting ground like Ambush Point and Refined Run, we have set the reward efficiency significantly higher than originally intended. We hope to provide numerous farming spots in The First Descendant, each with unique characteristics and usefulness to different Descendants. Instead of reverting Valby run to its original design intent, we have adjusted it to offer similar efficiency to other high-reward hunting grounds.</p><p>“Additionally, we have shortened the cooldowns for all outposts so that players can play them more frequently without deliberately failing and no longer need to search for outposts with shorter cooldowns by moving around the map. We have also added gold rewards to Special Operations and adjusted four types of Void Fragments to be randomly dropped, allowing players to choose and utilize various hunting grounds.</p><p>“Through issues like the Fortress Outskirts and Valby run, we are learning what kind of playstyle our players enjoy. The experience of sweeping through and farming monsters is of significant value in our game.</p><p>“Your feedback and interest are what drive the continuous improvement of The First Descendant. We will always listen to your feedback and improve the game.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The experience of sweeping through and farming monsters is of significant value in our game.</p></div><p>Joo Min-seok also offered a week five preview for The First Descendant, which goes live next week and adds a new Descendant called Luna. The details are below:</p><h2>The First Descendant week five update patch notes preview:</h2><p><strong>Sea of Emerald, "Ultimate Valby"</strong></p><p>Finally, the Magisters have completed the ultimate project for Valby. This ultimate equipment, called "Sea of Emerald," has fulfilled Valby's long-held desire. It is a nano suit that replicates Valby’s former body color and texture. Although covered in a thin layer, Valby feels like regaining a long-forgotten part of herself.</p><p><strong>Ultimate Valby’s Modification Modules</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spiral Tidal Wave: Replaces the Bubble Bullet, which was difficult to aim, with a projectile that flies straight. Spiral Tidal Wave attracts the impurities of Gluttony, making it an excellent choice for intercepting Gluttony.</li><li>Hydro Pressure Bomb: Instead of "Plop Plop," it leaps forward and deals damage to enemies around the landing area. The more enemies in the laundry state, the more powerful the damage, making Hydro Pressure Bomb a strong finishing blow. Instead of diving into the water, leap joyfully forward!</li></ul><p><strong>A New Descendant, "Luna"</strong></p><p>The Mad Artist Luna has returned to Albion after a long wandering performance. Luna's synthesizer gun becomes more powerful when fired in rhythm, enhancing allies' abilities based on the performance. When Luna dances to upbeat music, allies' skill power increases, and when dancing to relaxing music, allies' mentality recovers and resource consumption decreases. Invite everyone to Luna's concert. Unfortunately for Virgus, it will be their last stage, but Luna's performance is just beginning!</p><p><strong>Luna’s Modification Modules</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nimble Footsteps: Enhances Luna's mobility and amplifies the effect range of her performance, allowing for more effective ally support.</li><li>Noise Surge: Transforms Luna from a supporter to a combat dealer. Dashes towards enemies in rhythm, dealing damage to nearby enemies. When the inspiration gauge is full, summons a stage to recover mental strength and shields. Provide enemies with a terrifying musical experience with Noise Surge!</li></ul><p><strong>Gluttony</strong></p><p>The mutated Devourer-type Gluttony is a giant that indulges in Void Energy. It is equipped with systems to mine Void Energy and a cooling system to cool the heat generated during this process. To counter Gluttony, you need measures to withstand its cooling performance and the judgment to exploit its greedy temperament. Intercept Gluttony and collect new ultimate weapons and external components.</p><p><strong>New Ultimate Weapon "Peace Mediator"</strong></p><p>When meditation is necessary to bring peace to Ingris, the new ultimate weapon Peace Mediator is the perfect solution. This powerful hand cannon is effective even with single shots but can unleash a burst of bullets to deliver powerful firepower under the right conditions.</p><p><strong>New Ultimate Module "Arche Concretion"</strong></p><p>Provides Arche Concretion effect, which increases defense and mentality when using skills but decreases movement speed and attack power. It is particularly useful for Luna and Ajax and can be a good choice for players who want stable skill use. Your choices are free; combine various Modules to create your unique build.</p><p><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></p><p>In the week five update, we have decided to make balance adjustments for some Descendants and Ultimate weapons.</p><p>First, we are adjusting Valby, Blair, and Freyna, who use AOE as their main skills. We hope to see these Descendants more effectively dominate the battlefield, creating large AOE zones and leisurely watching enemies fall from the rear. Look forward to improved performance for these wide-range covering Descendants.</p><p>Additionally, there will be improvements to Ultimate weapons that enhance critical hit chance and damage. Enduring Legacy (machine gun), Secret Garden (tactical rifle), and Nazeistra's Devotion (hand cannon) will be improved to boast more powerful firepower with critical settings.</p><p>Moreover, Greg's Reversed Fate (tactical rifle) will be adjusted to activate its unique effect in more chances. We are also improving the functionality of single-shot weapons, allowing players to choose between single-shot and rapid-fire modes. Please look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Lastly,</strong></p><p>There will also be more improvements for convenience to be included in the week 5 update. Plus, new cosmetics that many players have been waiting for will be out, so please wait just one more week!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies"><u>with over 10 million players in just 10 days</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Are you looking for an intensive game for your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> night, made by a renowned game design team that has created several popular tabletop games? Scythe may be just that for the dedicated and patient board game crew. The design team at <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stonemaier Games</u></a> has created multiple other games my board game group has played, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">Wyrmspan</a> (the dragon version of Wingspan), and Viticulture.</p><p>Like some of their other games, Scythe is aimed at more experienced players who are willing to invest some time in it. It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a> based in Eastern Europe which involves elements of war. The game is pushed forward through engine building and completing objectives by gathering and creating resources, engaging in battles, working toward popularity, and strategically coordinating workers, a main character connected to a specific faction (each with their own powers), and mechs to journey across the board.</p><p>The base game can be played <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo</a> or with up to five players. It’s versatile if game night gets cancelled, and you still want to play anyway. That said, the game is heavy – literally and figuratively. The box with its components is heavy. The gameplay is quite complex. Setup, learning, and actual gameplay will take longer. This one is not recommended for less experienced gamers. There is only one version where this is an exception, as that version is an alternative <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">board game for kids</a>. We’ll get to that later on in our comprehensive guide.</p><p id="scythe-base-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Scythe: Base Game">Scythe: The Base Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ed704fba-30df-42c0-9afc-eb783b73fa27" id="205124"><div id="205124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $99.00 USD</li><li>1-5 Players </li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p>As mentioned, the base game is complex. Given its higher price tag, it will also be a bigger investment to start playing than some of the other board games listed in our other buying guides. This is likely tied to the figures inside the box, which can be painted to a player's liking.</p><p>You should get the base board game and learn it before you explore the expansions. Knowing how this original works will help you understand and connect with the other available expansions. </p><h2>Scythe Expansions</h2><p>Expansions can add more obstacles to the game. Some expansions also allow even more players to join the fun. Scythe has three expansions available.</p></div><p id="scythe-invaders-from-afar-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion">Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="dcbee0af-a471-450e-b399-2be9f625b6f7" id="205126"><div id="205126" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe: Invaders from Afar Expansion</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $35.00 USD</li><li>1-7 Players</li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 10 paintable plastic miniatures, two new player factions, additional pieces allowing for two more players, including mats and tokens- making the max amount of players up to seven</p><p>After getting the hang of the base system, add the first expansion: Invaders from Afar. The expansion adds two more factions to the game: Albion and Togawa. These factions will allow you new ways to explore, claim territories, and gain the necessary victory points to win the war.</p></div><p id="scythe-the-wind-gambit-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Scythe: The Wind Gambit Expansion">Scythe: The Wind Gambit Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="85b4360c-6596-4c58-aa36-ab28bc711797" id="205128"><div id="205128" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe: The Wind Gambit</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $30.00 USD</li><li>1-5 Players</li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 7 airship paintable miniatures, airship tiles, ability tiles, and resolution tiles</p><p>It’s time for you to expand to the air now in airship warfare. The Wind Gambit is playable for five players (without other expansions) and in solo mode. The expansion features some new features with tiles that trigger end-game content. It creates additional layers to be mindful of as you strategize your quest for victory.</p></div><p id="scythe-the-rise-of-fenris-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Scythe: The Rise of Fenris Expansion">Scythe: The Rise of Fenris Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="cb7431f0-4ea8-4e06-8ca1-3f36c6f45103" id="205129"><div id="205129" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Scythe: The Rise of Fenris </h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $60.00 USD</li><li>1-7 Players</li><li>115 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 13 paintable miniatures, wooden tokens, custom dice, tiles, cardboard tokens, a campaign log, and an achievement sheet</p><p>The Rise of Fenris is the final game in the original Scythe storyline. It adds additional depth to the game with campaign capacities (8 campaigns) and modular play (11 modules), which can be used alongside other expansions. One of the modules is a cooperative module instead of a competitive one.</p><p>You will need the base game to play it, like other expansions. Rise of Fenris can host five or seven players as well as solo play, depending on whether all of the expansions are owned. </p><h2>Other Scythe Games</h2><p>Two other Scythe games are available, operating as separate titles that do not require the base game. One is geared toward older players, and the other is a separate game with a separate expansion available to much younger players.</p></div><p id="expeditions"><h3 data-toc-title="Expeditions">Expeditions</h3></p><div catalogid="116190dc-3fba-4523-9858-754812872abc" id="187606"><div id="187606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Expeditions</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $80.00 USD</li><li>1-5 Players</li><li>60-90 minutes</li><li>Ages 14+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: Five big paintable miniatures, mech mats, location tiles, cards, multi-colored worker meeples, corruption tiles, and guides to playing solo or against other players</p><p>Expeditions is the sequel to Scythe. It’s a stand-alone game that takes place years after the original when a meteorite crashed near the Siberian Tunguska River. This game is completely separate from Scythe and requires no previous knowledge to play it.</p><p>Expeditions is an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine building board game</a> with different mechanics, objectives, and navigation. You’re working towards vanishing corruption in the area, enhancing your mechs powers through quests, gaining power, and building up worker capacities to acquire the most money and treasure to win the game. The game can be completed in about half the time as its predecessor. </p></div><p id="my-little-scythe"><h3 data-toc-title="My Little Scythe">My Little Scythe</h3></p><div catalogid="9caad0d3-c7fe-4540-a52d-4d5c28cc1642" id="205130"><div id="205130" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My Little Scythe</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $60.00 USD</li><li>1-6 Players</li><li>55 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: 14 paintable miniatures, a painting guide, an achievement sheet, custom apples, gems, mats, tokens, boards and cards</p><p>The kid's version of Scythe is a far less complicated game that turns the popular original into a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-friendly board game</a> that can be played with kids as young as eight. It incorporates animal characters to use with limited actions in a colorful journey involving pies, magic, castles, and friendship. While the game has war-like elements as they find and establish new homes, the fighting aspect is reduced to a quirky alternative: pie fights. </p><p>While this game has some fun elements, including the ability to share the joy of painting miniatures with your family, it’s not without its balance of good and places to bid caution. </p><p>This younger version can be played solo or with up to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>. It also plays in half the time that its adult counterpart titles do. However, quite a few pieces are still in the box. As a mom who knows the pain of wrangling parts in games with her own kids, I can warn you this is something that you’ll want to keep in mind during your family game night.</p></div><p id="my-little-scythe-pie-in-the-sky"><h3 data-toc-title="My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky">My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="f8bc9788-6f59-448e-b6fb-f8fc0ff432aa" id="205131"><div id="205131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My Little Scythe: Pie in the Sky</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>MSRP: $20.00 USD</li><li>1-6 Players</li><li>45-60 minutes</li><li>Ages 8+</li></ul><p><strong>Contents</strong>: two new paintable miniatures (owls and arctic foxes), one airship miniature, nine airship mats, five airship gadget tokens, four additional power-up tiles, two new quest cards, seventeen trophy tokens, rulebooks, and an achievement sheet</p><p>It’s the eve of a Harvest Tournament, and your animals seek to find new homes in the kingdom. Some time has passed since their last adventure, though. Now your animals have access to sky travel in the form of, you guessed it, airships. Some new animals have also joined the fun in this edition, which is playable for up to six players.</p><p>You need the base game to play the Pie in the Sky expansion. This expansion is also a far more accessible price point for many parents. </p><h2>More Ways to Play</h2><p>Scythe and its expansion, Invaders from Afar, can played on Steam in two different ways. The Polish development team, The Knights of Unity, developed a standalone and DLC version.  That base game of Scythe on <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdMVD?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Steam</a> is $19.99. The expansion, Invaders from Afar, is also <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZR34n?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">available as DLC</a> that can be added to the base game for an additional $9.99. </p><p>This digital version on Steam also features a lengthy tutorial. It took me about an hour to get through it when I ran through it. It’s a complex, slow-moving game with many moving pieces and mechanics. The tutorial, despite being long, was immensely helpful in helping me navigate and learn game mechanics for the base game and the expansion. </p><p>The Steam version offers the ability to play the game solo against up to 6 players (when you have the expansion and the base game), which can be any combination of AI bots or local human players. Players can also pair up with folks online if they choose to. You’ll have an extra step to set up for online play. Online play will require you to register with AsmoConnect and create an account to play online.</p><p>The game and several expansions (Invaders from Afar, Scythe: The Rise of Fenris, Scythe: The Wind Gambit, Scythe: The Wind Gambit + Invaders from Afar) as well as its sequel Expeditions and the version for younger players called My Little Scythe can also be played on the browser-based board game platform <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMeyV?object_uuid=54ebe9ff-660c-49c3-b93d-bd40574b2190&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Tabletopia</a>. Tabletopia operates as a different subscription-based service on multiple platforms. It has three tiers from which interested players can choose. Each level tier gives folks different capacities to play games. </p><p>You can get a Bronze level membership, allowing you to play two simultaneous game sessions for free. In the case of Scythe, it will allow you to play the base game of Scythe (2 players with Crimea vs Nordic), the kid's version of Scythe for up to 7 players, and the sequel’s demo edition for up to players for free. </p><p>You’ll need a Silver or Gold tier subscription to play the other editions and the capacity to play. The Silver tier subscription, which costs $9.97 monthly, gives you access to premium games. The Gold level subscription costs $14.97 monthly, allowing subscribers to add guests to premium games. </p><p>Tabletopia also has Scythe as a playable game in its Premium collection on Steam. The Premium level subscription on Steam is $14.97 monthly, but don’t worry about double spending! You can connect your Steam and browser accounts and pay only one monthly fee of $14.97.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The popularity of the Scythe series is nuanced. For one, the art is absolutely gorgeous. The capacity for players of multiple age groups to add to it with paintable figurines adds a layer of customizable beauty. The game was made by board game designer <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/about/staff/jamey-stegmaier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamey Stegmaier</a> who is extremely interactive with the community. The team at Stonemaier has several other strong titles in its catalogue. I can see why the game received its 8.1 rating on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the learning curve is quite considerable. The online tutorial was tremendously helpful in its stand-alone version via The Knights of Unity Steam version. Learning to play it via Tabletopia was far more difficult as you had to learn how to play the game and move pieces without the help of a program that helped to do that for you. I’m not sure I would feel comfortable playing that version with younger kids via the browser version of Tabletopia or their Steam version, even though the kid's version is among the free games on the base-level subscription.</p><p>In its physical form, Scythe is also a massive game that requires considerable investment in purchase, storage space, and keeping all those pieces together, especially in the kids' version. The company offers a way to get replacement parts; however, the price of those parts is not immediately visible, so it’s unknown how much it would cost if multiple things went missing after a chaotic game night.</p><p>Seasoned and patient players will likely enjoy the game. It’s worth giving a chance, especially if you can partner with a friend or two who are already familiar with it to help you learn the ropes. Try it out at a board game cafe, or see which of your friends already owns it and try theirs. Seasoned gamers will likely know at least one person with a copy in their friend circle. I found several who did in mine when I initially asked about it!</p><p>Lastly, the younger version counterpart is also incredibly cute. It softens up the war aspects of the game for players who might want a less abrasive alternative that takes less time to complete regardless of their age. Sure, mechs are cool, but pie fighting with animals is quite a delightful spin on an otherwise heavier topic.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

                <p>PC gaming handhelds have proven to be quite popular, and if you're looking for a deal on one of the newer models, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Claw-Gaming-Handheld-Thunderbolt/dp/B0CXG3DBQV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw right now at Amazon for just $600</a>.

With this big discount, MSI is now being more competitive with its big handheld unit, which has a seven-inch screen and a more comfortable design. While MSI is still working to catch up to Asus and Steam when it comes to overall performance, recent updates have helped improve the quality of the gaming experience.</p><h2>MSI Claw Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Claw-Gaming-Handheld-Thunderbolt/dp/B0CXG3DBQV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 512GB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Amazon)</a> -- $600 ($<strike>750</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036387812563663%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 512GB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Best Buy)</a> -- $650 ($<strike>750</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036414014400035%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw A1M 1TB Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (Best Buy)</a> -- $750 ($<strike>800</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836036358203348049%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MSI Claw 512GB Intel Core Ultra 5 processor</a> -- $600 ($<strike>700</strike>)</li></ul><p>In addition to its comfortable design, the MSI Claw also has Hall Effect joysticks, high-quality face buttons, and stereo speakers that can deliver an impressive level of sound.

This PC gaming handheld is <em>very </em>inspired by the Nintendo Switch, as it has detachable gaming controllers--similar to the Switch's Joy-Cons--and you get a built-in stand for the main body. Normally $700, it's on sale for $629 at Amazon. This one has some impressive hardware inside of it, like an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chipset, up to 1TB of NVMe SSD storage capacity, and an 8.8-inch 144Hz display. It's also quite hefty, but the silver lining here is that you'll get a great arm workout by using it.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1844733087673373358%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmsi-claw-pc-gaming-handheld-gets-massive-discount-at-amazon%2F1100-6525249%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The beefed-up Asus ROG Ally X</a>--which offers some substantial improvements on last year's model--also launched this month and is available for $800.</p>

<p>A new report from WIRED has claimed that Activision has used AI-generated skins to sell in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, Activision Blizzard started using AI in its games in early 2023 and, by late 2023, had reportedly sold its first AI-generated cosmetic skin in its latest title, Modern Warfare 3. The report heavily implies that the skin “Yokai’s Wrath” was created in part by AI.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One former Activision employee who worked on Modern Warfare 3 tells me that the timeline of WIRED’s reporting is correct and that leadership boasted about AI in its townhall meetings. “I recall during a townhall, leadership boasted about using A.I tools like Midjourney, etc to streamline production timelines,” it was said.</p>



<p>Weekly emails across the studios also consisted of AI-generated skins, they continued.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many Call of Duty skins or cosmetics have been created or inspired by AI. Still, developers tell me that it wasn’t uncommon to be “encouraged” to use AI tools to make some creative processes more efficient. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would be&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-microsoft-layoffs-affect-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 1900 employees at the company</a>, including those at Activision Blizzard. In May 2024, it was also announced that Xbox would&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down four of its game studios</a>, including Tango Gamewords and Arkane Austin.</p>

<p>A reliable Xbox Game Pass leaker has claimed that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on August 8.</p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815874694349770896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who has become incredibly accurate about Xbox Game Pass leaks. </p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, the leaker said, “100% CONFIRMED. C<strong>rash Bandicoot n sane trilogy w</strong>ill be available on Gamepass on August 8, 2024. I’m going to remember it because I didn’t post an individual tweet about it and perhaps some have not seen the video where I mentioned it, I give myself the luxury of confirming it as well.”</p>



<p>In early July, the same leaker claimed that the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy would be coming to Xbox Game Pass in August, a rumor corroborated by other leakers and journalists. The date has since been doubled-down on, though, with the more recent tweet confirming the date.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Xbox announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-officially-announced-for-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, too, which was a rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>When other Activision games will be available on Xbox Game Pass, Insdier Gaming understands that the game library will be trickled to Game Pass subscribers over the next several months. However, there’s still some uncertainty about the older Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy on Xbox Game Pass?</p>

            <p>All 36 employees of Humble Games publishing have reportedly been laid off. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221563370863280128/">According to</a> business developer Nicola Kwan, staff were informed at 9am this morning, and told that “the company is shutting down.” Humble dispute this in a statement made to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bumble-shuts-down-game-publishing-label">Game Developer</a>, claiming that the publishing label is "undergoing restructuring," as opposed to a full shutdown.</p>
<p>Humble’s statement - which you can read in full <a href="https://x.com/PlayHumbleGames/status/1815851182977425772">here</a> - attributes the events to “challenging economic times for indie game publishing,” saying that “Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Humble Games is operated by Ziff Davis, who also own the Gamer Network stable of websites, including Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<p>Chris Radley, who was Humble’s creative lead up until 2022, is among those who are publicly disputing this framing. “I want it to be made abundantly clear,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221616554927411200/">wrote Radley</a>. “this is NOT a restructuring of operations. This is a total shutdown of HumbleGames. Operations have been handed off to a third party consultancy. NO staff are left.”</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign">to Aftermath</a>, an unnamed employee called the ‘restructuring’ claims an effort to “save face.” Aftermath report that former employees told them that Humble Games had not signed any projects for 2026 or 2027. "With [parent company Ziff Davis's] stock going down, they simply decided they did not want to be in that business anymore. Their decision was not rational and will really hurt indie development in the long run, on top of their employees and the project in development,” said one anonymous employee. </p>
<p>Aftermath also obtained a recording of the morning meeting, in which Ziff Davis' technology and shopping division president Steve Horowitz said that the company had attempted to sell Humble Games twice before, but “neither attempt created significant demand, and unfortunately neither attempt created a viable offer or an outcome." Horowitz also said that Humble's remaning publishing projects are being handed over a third-party consulting firm the Powell Group.</p>
<p>Humble Games, a publishing label under The Humble Bundle brand, has put out games including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forager">Forager</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, and most recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bo-path-of-the-teal-lotus">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus</a>.</p>
<p>As Game Developer point out, this is Humble Games’s second round of layoffs in recent months, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-games-lays-off-valued-colleagues-as-restructuring-begins">following the firing</a> of an “unspecified number of staff from its publishing arm” last November.</p>
<p>“Another year, another lay off! Today is mine and my entire team's last day at Humble Games,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7221568858485092352/">wrote</a> Senior QA Emilee Kieffer. “The game industry is volatile, it's been inundated by people who only want exponential growth at the expense of making great games with great teams. Billionaires and CEOs are making record profits at the expense of the employees who actually create the products. But I believe we have the power to create studios that benefit us as game developers and not people that only see us as money printing machines.”</p>

            <p>
Mario + Rabbids lead developer Davide Soliani is leaving Ubisoft after 25 years.
</p>
<p>
Soliani spent 11 years working on the two Mario + Rabbids games, released on Switch in 2017 and 2022 in conjunction with Nintendo. The developer is yet to reveal what he'll be working on next, beyond embarking on "a new adventure".
</p>
<p>
"Hi all folks. After 25 years, 11 of which beautifully spent working with Nintendo on Mario+Rabbids along the company of our incredible community of players, I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure," he wrote on social media site X. "I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly."

<p>
Soliani posted his statement alongside the iconic image of himself captured at the Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle reveal at Ubisoft's 2017 E3 presentation (above video), in which Mario creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> praised his work. The very sweet moment became a bit of a meme afterwards as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Ubisoft Crying Man</a> - and a year later Eurogamer Editor-in-Chief Tom Phillips interviewed Soliani about his work.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review">Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</a> received a positive response and became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-is-switchs-best-selling-non-nintendo-game">best-selling third-party game on Switch</a> at the time. It was quickly followed up by a sequel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-review-snooker-in-space">Sparks of Hope</a>.


</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">Ubisoft later admitted the sequel underperformed by comparison</a>, with CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledging the company "should have waited" for the next Nintendo console.

</p>
<p>
"We had already released a Mario Rabbids game [on Switch], so by doing another we had two similar experiences on one machine. On Nintendo, games like this never die. There are 25 Mario games on Switch," said Guillemot.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo [has advised] that it's better to do one iteration on each machine. We were a bit too early, we should have waited for [the next console]."
</p>
<p>
Sparks of Hope has since received multiple DLCs, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raymans-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-dlc-get-august-release-date">return of Ubisoft icon Rayman</a>.

            <p>The latest free update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> will let you "define the conditions under which your Sims become jealous". That's handy. The new feature, called "Romantic Boundaries", will give you some settings to tweak that determine whether a Sim will be bothered when they see their partner flirting with the neighbour, or kissing the neighbour, or getting into bed with the neighbour, or becoming a blur of obscene pixels with the neighb- okay Cindy, stop! I'm not comfortable with this. When I said we could open up I didn't mean with <em>Nigel</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can make it so Sims will get bothered by "non-physical romance", such as a stranger complimenting their appearance. Or you can limit jealousy to kick in only when "physical romance" begins, like kissing and holding hands. Or you can switch it all off completely to create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTsdKycVZZ4">the polyamorous couple of your dreams/nightmares</a>. </p>
<p>By default, any existing Sims in your saved games will all be fiercely jealous monogamous types. But newly created rando-Sims will vary on what they consider cheaty behaviour. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1222670/view/4377019664797445936">patch notes go into more detail</a>, but basically the new options appear in the character creation screen, alongside "Gender" and "Sexual orientation". The patch also changes some of the language of relationships to be more neutral, with "husband" and "wife" keywords getting replaced with the simple "spouse", while "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" have become "partner". </p>
<p>There are  other quality of life changes when it comes to relationships. "Previously, the Partners relationship could only be established through gameplay," say the developers. "Now you can set it within Create a Sim between two Sims in your household." That's useful for setting up a couple straight off the bat.</p>
<p>This all comes ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-lovestruck-expansion-adds-a-dating-app-and-outdoor-woohoo">the paid Lovestruck DLC</a>, which is coming out tomorrow and is due to add a bunch of new dating options for romance-focused Sims. They can use a new dating app, for example. And you'll be able to set your wee peoples' "turn-ons" and "turn-offs" to help determine exactly how their romantic entanglements shake out. But that's all the paid stuff - today's patch is a free update to the base <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a>, basically prepping the ground for the new features the DLC will add.</p>
<p>Alongside the changes, there are a bunch of other fixes and rejigs. As is my custom, here are the ones I found most enjoyable when read out-of-context. </p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to customize Toddler Toenails has returned.</li>
<li>Professors no longer run away when attempting to take them on a date.</li>
<li>Sims on Horses no longer socialize with Sims through walls.</li>
<li>Ghost Sims are now available for "Ask on Date..." from the Relationship Panel.</li>
<li>Lips are synced so that Sims making out keep their lips on their kissing partner. No more awkwardly talking mid-kiss!</li>
<li>When Sims get steamy in the shower from WooHoo, music now jazzes up the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I say, the Lovestruck expansion pack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/">out tomorrow on Steam</a>, and costs £35. Turns out money <em>can</em> buy you love.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-next-update-to-introduce-land-vehicles-leaked-screenshots-showcases-black-buggy-%E2%80%93-rumor.935340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield's next update is apparently going to add the land vehicles that were talked about a while back to aid players in their exploration endeavors.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSodiumStarfield/comments/1eaiixf/leaked_screenshot_of_a_black_buggy_different_from/">NoSodiumStarfield subreddit</a>, buggies are coming in the next update, which will launch on a yet to be confirmed date. The buggies will come in two variants and are two passengers only, with a third optional passenger slot left for Vasco. NPCS from rescue missions will also be able to ride the buggy. Both buggy variations will have their weapons, a laser mode with slowdown and a launcher, and they will scale depending on the player's certified skills.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Starfield land vehicles will be easy to obtain and transport around, as just buying them from the ship technicians will make them spawn near the ship. Sadly, customization options seem to be limited to colors, as anything that will sport a new part will essentially be considered a new vehicle. Lastly, the leaker said that buggies seem to be working well, unlike Skyrim's horses, so it seems like they will be a more than viable way to explore the game's many planets.</p>
<p>Alongside the leaked information, <a href="https://gyazo.com/90ed59f3cd0dbe947a5911aba97fc892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a screenshot</a> showcasing one of the buggies that are supposedly coming to Starfield in the next update was shared online, giving slightly more validity to a 4chan leak that wouldn't have been considered reliable otherwise. Still, it's best to take everything with a grain of salt until an official confirmation comes in.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle. </p><p>This bundle was sold for 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that Wired did not specify which part of this bundle was AI-generated, or indeed whether all of it was. The bundle contained a number of virtual items, including an Operator skin, a weapon blueprint, a calling card, a weapon sticker, and a loading screen, all below.</p><p>IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/screenshot-2024-07-24-094251-1721810585928.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Yokai’s Wrath bundle. Image credit: <a href="https://codmwstore.com/operators-identity/yokais-wrath/">codmwstore.com</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs are being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p>“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p>Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-generative-ai-can-be-used-in-creative-ways-but-highlights-ip-issues">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the company’s initiatives involving AI</a>.

Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.</p></div><p>Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent">The game failed</a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p>Video game console makers Microsoft and Sony are all-in on AI.

<p>"A hot-blooded, hellishly twisted, feverishly filthy, love and hate filled road trip," is how the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535440/Shadows_of_the_Damned_Hella_Remastered/">Steam page</a> describes it. "Join the crass Garcia Hotspur and his boney buddy, Johnson, as they traverse the depths of the Underworld to steal back Garcia's kidnapped lover, Paula, from the clutches of Fleming, the Lord of the Underworld. Let the soul of rock 'n' roll run loose in the heart of the twisted hellscape that is the Underworld." The page does not feature any quotes of Garcia referring to his gun as  "My Big Boner," but this does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>Shadows Of The Damned was a collaboration between Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a>’s Shinji Mikami. Famously, there was reportedly a bit of tension during development between the studio and publisher EA. Suda cleared up some details in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Ur7Mubc3mi4">recent interview with GhenryPerez</a> on YouTube, going into a few elements he wishes he’d manage to retain - including a gun with a tiny version of the character Paula inside, who would communicate with the player. Suda was forbidden to keep this in the game, being told "You guys don't understand... Americans hate little girls!"</p>
<p>In the process of googling a fact for this piece, I turned up this old<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/shadows-of-the-damned-screens"> EA press page</a> thing from 2011 that describes the game as "a mind-shattering adventure that has to been seen to be believed," in the way only something written about a videogame in 2011 could.</p>
<p>Back in March, the credits for Shadows Of The Damned: Hella Remastered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-year-after-leaving-evil-within-and-hi-fi-rush-devs-resident-evil-legend-shinji-mikami-has-founded-a-new-studio">revealed that </a>Shinji Mikami had started a new studio, a year after leaving the (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">now shuttered</a>) Tango Gameworks - who Edwin argued <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tango-gameworks-deserves-to-be-remembered-for-more-than-shinji-mikami">deserved to be remembered</a> for far more than just Mikami’s contribution.</p>

            <p>
The remaster of 2011 action-adventure Shadows of the Damned is set to release this Halloween.
</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-the-damned-remaster-announced">Grasshopper Manufacture announced the remaster last year</a>, which will release across PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's a cult-classic demon-shooting game written by Suda 51 (Killer 7) and produced by Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil).
</p>
<p>
News of the release date - and live pre-orders - was included in a new trailer filled with gore and screams. I'm not joking, you might want headphones for this one.

<p>
The trailer includes some new footage of the remaster, including some of its new costumes.
</p>
<p>
It also lists various amusing job titles for the team: Mikami, for instance, is Mentor of Masters, Thief of Awards, and Spiritual Guru, among others. Suda 51, meanwhile, is a part-time influencer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned follows lead character Garcia Hotspur, a Mexican demon hunter who visits the City of the Damned to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming.
</p>
<p>
It's all very silly, combining some psychological horror with a punk rock aesthetic - if that wasn't already abundantly clear from the trailer.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of the Damned was followed a year later by Lollipop Chainsaw, another Suda 51 action game. That's also set to receive a remaster, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, which will be out in September across PC via Steam, PS5, Switch and Xbox Series X/S.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-complete-ray-tracing-8k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-looks-utterly-stunning-with-complete-ray-tracing-at-8k-resolution.935316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-complete-ray-tracing-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Assassin's Creed Mirage looks decent enough, its visuals are most definitely not on the same level as those of games such as Cyberpunk 2077. Still, with some mods, it is possible to make the game look stunning on PC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Dreams</a> recently shared a new video showcasing the latest entry in the series running at 8K resolution and with a variety of mods such as ReSTIR G.I. better Ray Tracing and Complete RT, a custom reshade preset that improves color grading, an immersive camera mod and others. Needless to say, the end results look incredible.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] AC Mirage: RAYTRACING Mod | Complete RT | RTX 4090 |  ULTRA GRAPHICS OVERHAUL 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUnctTma7Bw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage brought the series back to its roots, doing away with the role-playing game mechanics introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins to offer an experience that is closer in every possible way to the first entries in the series, which are still considered to be the best by many. Despite the game not making a very good first impression, it is still a solid game that grows on the player, as highlighted by Nathan in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage doesn’t make the sharpest first impression with its dated visuals and by-the-book mechanics, but like its hooded protagonist, the game sneaks up on you with its manageably-sized yet vibrant map, intricately-woven campaign and varied missions. Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s blade may be slightly tarnished, but it still leaves a mark.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>"Do you fancy playing as a couple of skellies named 'The Boner Brothers' riding a bike and sidecar while chunky bastard-metal blasts out, also they’ve got a gun, also they can do tricks?" asked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/motordoom">Motördoom</a>, to which I became so instantly hyperactive I somehow worked out how to headbutt my own face. Of course I want to put a chainsaw on the front of my bike, Motördoom. Obviously I want a rougelike-able upgrade that perchance may set my demonic enemies on fire. Yes, I’d like to combine a sick manual with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> killstreak for a very large combo, Motördoom. Is this what overly concerned parents thought PS1 games were actually like? If I got a disc with this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">demo</a> on as a kid, I’d be significantly radder than I am today. Gnarly, even. Made of gnarls.</p>

<p>"Motördoom is a freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," which, must be said, might the pitch to end all pitches. I must ask, though: why is the crucial umlaut absent from the actual Steam title? It’s a mystery, though not one I’m willing to unpack right now. I’m playing Motördoom, you see.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Motördoom Release Date Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNpSXIgUSGY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>"Combine your trick combo with kills to earn even more points. Once you land your combo, gain experience points as high as the combo score. Earn enough points and you'll be given the choice of one of three random Demonic Offerings," continues the umlaut-less Steam page. "These upgrades grant you more power to defeat the ever growing horde of grotesque monsters. So jump up in the air, slow down time and shoot these demonic abominations!"</p>
<p>I will say that, on balance, Motördoom is roughly 20% less rad to play than it actually looks. It feels a little floaty, a little awkward to control, although I’ll freely admit I’m likely just very bad at it. It’s already sold me enough on the concept enough to get better at it though. And yet, 20% less than almost irresponsibly rad is still very rad. I await its full release with bated umlauts.</p>
