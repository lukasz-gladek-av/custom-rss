                <p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we got another look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. Most importantly, it received an October 21 release date.</p><p>The trailer gave us another look at its brutal action, which looks on par with what Platinum Games usually delivers, as well as some of the fantastical enemies and bosses that players will be going up against throughout the game. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/ninja-gaiden-4-prevew-interview-xbox-games-showcase/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire preview post</a> provided even more details on the game.</p><p>It revealed that mechanical Dark Nest Terminals will be scattered throughout the levels, and players can restock items and take on optional missions to earn Ninja Coins. Players can use those Ninja Coins when they meet a character named Tyran throughout each level, who will teach them new and returning action skills.</p><p>When Ninja Gaiden 4 comes out on October 21, it will be available across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Like all games published by Xbox, it will be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass Catalog. A new 2D Ninja Gaiden, titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ragebound/" data-ref-id="5000-654954">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, is also in the works and launches on July 21.</p>

                <p>Xbox is partnering with Asus on a Windows-based handheld with support for your Game Pass library, Steam, GOG, and other PC gaming clients. The long-rumored handheld was officially revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The ROG Xbox Ally is slated to launch Holiday 2025. No pricing details were provided, but two configurations were revealed.</p><p>Like the regular Asus ROG Ally handhelds, the "X" version is the premium model. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is fitted with an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD.</p><p>The base model ROG Xbox Ally is white like the Xbox Series S and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4508932-xboxrogally.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508932" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4508932-xboxrogally.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508932"></a><figcaption>ROG Xbox Ally</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4508932-xboxrogally.png"></figure><p>Both models share the same design and form factor, which is a departure from the lineup of ROG Ally handhelds made solely by Asus. Current ROG Ally handhelds have rounded handhelds and generally look more Switch-like, whereas the ROG Xbox Ally has traditional controller grips like the PlayStation Portal.</p><p>Xbox said both editions can natively play the full Game Pass library, which means you can download any of the hundreds of titles in the PC Game Pass catalog. The ROG Xbox Ally also supports cloud streaming and remote play, so Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can stream all of the games in the Xbox Cloud Gaming service over Wi-Fi. You can also play your full Xbox Series X|S library via remote play with a Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Since the ROG Xbox Ally is, in practice, a Windows PC with additional Xbox integration, you won't be limited to the Xbox ecosystem. All PC game clients for Windows will work on both devices, so that means you'll be able to download games from Steam, GOG, Epic Games Store, and more. And since Windows supports PS Remote Play and cloud streaming, you should be able to stream your PS5 games library, too.</p>

                <p>A new title from Pokemon studio Game Freak was revealed at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>--titled Beast of Reincarnation, the upcoming game is a new action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-dev-game-freak-reveals-project-bloom-a-new-action-adventure-game/1100-6513954/" data-ref-id="1100-6513954">originally announced as "Project Bloom,"</a> is set for a 2026 release on Xbox Series X/S and PC as a day one Game Pass title.</p><p>The brief announcement trailer shows a version of Japan, in the year 4026, corrupted by blight, which was brought on by a giant monstrous creature. Beast of Reincarnation's protagonist is named Emma, an outcast marked as a "Blighted One. Gameplay footage showcases parts of her journey, punctuated with shots of samurai action, vine swinging, and epic boss battles.</p><p>In the trailer, Emma fights a variety of enemies, from massive tree-like behemoths to what appear to be robots. She is accompanied by her dog Koo, who will presumably be part of the action. Despite her outcast status, a character in the trailer states that Emma is the "blade" that will destroy the eponymous Beast of Reincarnation.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-qZiMPsNz0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L-qZiMPsNz0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer's YouTube description describes the combat as "demanding" and "technical," and live commentators during the Xbox Showcase noted similarities to games like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and the Nioh series.</p><p>While Game Freak is, of course, best known for the mainline Pokemon games on Nintendo platforms, the Tokyo-based studio has developed several other IPs, including Tembo the Badass Elephant, Giga Wrecker, and Little Town Hero. The title was originally announced as being published by Private Division, but according to the trailer, Beast of Reincarnation is published by Fictions Inc.</p>

Speaking after the reveal, Xbox's Sarah Bond confirmed that Silksong will be out soon, stating that it will be "available at launch and in Game Pass" when the handheld launches later this year.</p><p>This isn't the first time Microsoft has confirmed Silksong's release window. Back in 2022, Silksong featured during the Xbox Games Showcase then, with each game at the show supposedly releasing within 12 months. It was later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">indefinitely delayed</a>, only surfacing again during the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal earlier this year.</p><p>First revealed more than five years ago, details on Silksong have been very hard to come by since 2019. While Team Cherry has teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-more-enemies-in-brief-/1100-6472220/" data-ref-id="1100-6472220">enemy designs</a> and gameplay updates over the years, everything else has remained a mystery.</p><p>After appearing in the original Hollow Knight as a powerful enemy first and an ally later, Silksong stars Hornet, a princess who is both the daughter of the god-like ruler of Hallownest, the Pale King, and the spider queen of Deepnest, Herrah the Beast. The expansion-turned-sequel will allow players to wield Hornet's needle and thread across a wide variety of stages in an action-packed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/" data-ref-id="2900-4005">metroidvania</a>.</p><p>Silksong has currently been announced for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. On Xbox and PC, Silksong will be available through Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>

It’s clear that success was not lost on the game makers, as today brought the announcement of Grounded 2, a brand new game in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Grounded 2 follows up on the premise of the original game, this time seeing the adventurous kids navigating a local park, riding ants, running along picnic tables and fallen popsicles, and battling a bevy of spiders and scorpions.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Grounded 2 is closer than you might expect for a newly announced project; expect it to arrive to Xbox Game Preview on July 29.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s great to see the early success of the franchise be rewarded with another entry, though we’re left to wonder how Obsidian is staying on top of so many projects. With <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/avowed/high-fun-per-square-foot">Avowed earlier this year</a>, Grounded 2 in Game Preview this summer, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/the-outer-worlds-2-targets-fall-release">The Outer Worlds 2 now set for October</a>, that development house has had a very busy year.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But perhaps what's even more surprising than Xbox finally diving into the handheld race is the reveal that Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games of every year since its announcement, will be coming to the console at launch this holiday.</p><p>The showcase might still show off a proper trailer for Team Cherry's metroidvania sequel, but as it stands, all we saw was some new clips of protagonist Hornet platforming through a dangerous-looking area full of spinning blades and acrobatically attacking various bug-shaped enemies.</p>

<p>The game was at an Xbox summer showcase three years ago, when it was promised to launch sometime within the next 12 months. It was obviously delayed. The last time we saw it, however, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d70c00a-ace5-4c4a-a1c2-b92d36666a68" data-entity-substitution="canonical">was at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, when we learned it would be coming out later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>It's worth noting that the trailer didn't say the game would be launching with the Xbox handheld, just that "it will be available at launch," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond. This means the game could launch any time between then and now, but whenever the Xbox handheld has a release date, we'll know Silksong is due out before then.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very least, it sounds like Team Cherry is doubling down on 2025, so if it doesn't launch this year, it will be more surprising than ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you can't wait to crack the whip for another round with everyone's favourite fedora wearing professor, I have good news. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s DLC - The Order of Giants - is set for release this autumn.</p>
<p>It is arriving on 4th September, across Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>As for what this DLC will be about, it is set during the events of the main game, and takes place in Rome. The DLC will feature "stunning new locations, intricate puzzles, terrifying new foes and more", with the developer mentioning Indy will have to do what he can to "outwit a dangerous cult" while uncovering "the dark legacy of the Nephilim giants".</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>"One of the most satisfying parts of developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was the opportunity to create the Nephilim Order, the secret society of giants formed by descendants of fallen angels working to atone for their ancestral sins," <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-great-circle-dlc-order-giants-xbox-games-showcase/">said production director John Jennings</a>.</p>
<p>"That story spans thousands of years and this DLC has given us the opportunity to develop further upon their lore and look at other aspects not covered in the initial story campaign. There's something new and unexpected to tell here for fans of the game, and we can't wait for people to be able to play it for themselves."</p>

            <p>
Bloober's next game, Cronos: The New Dawn, will be released this autumn - presumably in time for Halloween.
</p>
<p>
The Polish studio's follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> was shown at today's Xbox Games Showcase, though it will be released across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.

The news was accompanied by a new gameplay trailer you can watch below.

<p>
Cronos: The New Dawn is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Bloober's first original survival horror game</a>, taking heavy inspiration from its Silent Hill 2 remake as well as Resident Evil and Dead Space.
</p>
<p>
I had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-has-found-its-feet-with-cronos-the-new-dawn-its-survival-horror-follow-up-to-silent-hill-2">a preview of the game at this year's Game Developer Conference</a>, where I got to see its unique merge mechanic. If enemies aren't properly killed they can merge with others to boost their abilities - it reminded me of the Crimson Heads from the GameCube Resident Evil remake.
</p>
<p>
The game's setting is inspired by inspired by the brutalist architecture of Krakow's Nowa Huta and is heavily influenced by sci-fi themes.

This new game will feature a new protagonist alongside series icon Ryu Hayabusa.

</p>
<p>
The new gameplay trailer, above, showed off plenty of frantic, gory action in a futuristic world. In all, it's typical Ninja Gaiden stuff.

		<p>Ready to get shrunk down and fight some ants again? Those busy bees at Obsidian are doing it again, miniaturising players and setting them loose in the back yard in Grounded 2 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will start off in Game Preview for Xbox Series X|S on 29th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grounded 2 - Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHJ1V4CePiI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Turns out it’s the exact same kids that have been shrunk, according to the trailer blrub:</p>
<p>Shrunk again, but the world is much larger. In this open-world, single-player or co-op survival adventure, craft weapons and armor, build your base, and traverse the playground on your buggy. But something else is out there—and it hasn’t forgotten you.</p>

<p>The original Grounded was announced and entered Xbox Game Preview back in 2020, one of the first new projects from the recently acquired Obsidian Entertainment. The game is a step away from the company’s traditional RPG fare, a four player co-op survival game that borrows a little from the classic film Honey, I Shrunk the Kids! It gained quite a healthy following with a long string of updates from the company, building up to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/29/grounded-final-update-0-14-27-september-release-date/">&nbsp;its full release two years later in 2022</a>, but was then part of the first wave of PlayStation 5 ports from Xbox in early 2024, which saw it gain a big new following on PlayStation as well.</p>

		<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is launching on 21st October across Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on 21st October 2025, PlatinumGames and Team Ninja have revealed. it will also be day one in Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Official Release Date Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GA70JV2dCMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the first game in more than a decade, with Team Ninja leaning on Platinum Games’ expertise through the likes of Nier:Automata and Bayonetta to push the series forward.</p>
<p>Ryu will return from previous games, but there’s a new playable character of Yakumo, coming from the rival Raven Clan and looking to follow in Hayabusa’s footsteps to become the Master Ninja. The story will return to a futuristic Tokyo which now exists in the shadow of the Dark Dragon’s husk, with a never-ending corrupting rain coming down from it to suggest that it still lives.</p>
<p>The game will feature plenty of fast-paced action, whether it’s navigating the world through wall-running, rail grinding, grappling and more, and through the blistering melee combat.&nbsp;There’s a both a Raven Style and Nué Style that looks to push the series combat forward with two contrasting sets of abilities.</p>

			<p>MachineGames isn't done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">whip-cracking explorer who was named after his family's dog</a>, as the studio announced Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants today during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025.</p>
<p>The Order of Giants is a DLC expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and it'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this coming&nbsp;<strong>September 4, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It is a paid DLC expansion, but if you already purchased the premium edition of The Great Circle, or at least bought the premium upgrade, then you don't have to spend another dime to get this DLC; all you'll have to do is download an update when the DLC launches. Players who also bought the collector's edition of The Great Circle also don't have to buy the DLC separately.</p>
<p>The story of the DLC takes place during the events of the main game, after Indy meets Father Ricci in Rome, and according to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-great-circle-dlc-order-giants-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire</a> post, the expansion "<em>introduces stunning new locations, intricate puzzles, terrifying new foes and more</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>One of the most satisfying parts of developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was the opportunity to create the Nephilim Order, the secret society of giants formed by descendants of fallen angels working to atone for their ancestral sins,</em>" said John Jennings, production director on the game.</p>
<p>"<em>That story spans thousands of years and this DLC has given us the opportunity to develop further upon their lore and look at other aspects not covered in the initial story campaign. There's something new and unexpected to tell here for fans of the game, and we can't wait for people to be able to play it for themselves.</em>"</p>

			<p>Resonance - A Plague Tale, the third entry in the series developed by Asobo Studio, has been revealed today for a 2026 release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series was revealed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfssswW0qf4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new trailer</a> shared during today's Xbox Games Showcase, providing a first look at the setting and main character. Resonance - A Plague Tale will be set fifteen years before A Plague Tale: Requiem and will star the young woman Sofia as she seeks her independence as a fierce plunderer in the unforgiving world of the 14th century. No rat was spotted in the trailer, but there will definitely be no shortage of dangers to overcome when the game launches in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering how A Plague Tale: Requiem improved on its predecessor's formula in a lot of different ways, we should expect Resonance - A Plague Tale to move the series forward considerably. In case you have never had the chance to experience Amicia and Hugo's latest adventure, you can learn more about it by checking out Chris'<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-plague-tale-requiem-review/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>A Plague Tale: Requiem is a faithful follow-up to the first outing, managing to expand in every way while staying true to what made the first great. With solid gameplay, a fantastic story that's excellently acted and presented, and set pieces that could challenge even the biggest game in the industry, if you like the first outing from Asobo Studio, you will love this.</em></p>

			<p>Kicking off the Xbox Games 2025 Showcase was The Outer Worlds 2, with Obsidian Entertainment making sure no one had to wait for <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</a> after the rest of the showcase to learn that The Outer Worlds 2 will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <strong>October 29, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new story trailer showcased a good chunk of gameplay and a bit more of an insight into the game's story, where you'll step into the shoes of an Earth Directorate agent, tasked with uncovering the mystery behind a rift that could destroy all of humanity.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUDdFBFTYRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this release date set, Obsidian is on the brink of releasing two strong RPGs in the same year, after it kicked things off with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a> earlier in the year. However, Avowed was a new world for players to step into. The stakes for a sequel are quite different for Obsidian's second release of the year.</p>
<p>The first game was a strong foundation that struck a chord with players, but didn't entirely knock it out of the park compared to Obsidian's previous RPG outings.</p>
<p>At the time of the first game's release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo</a> was impressed with the game, but still recommended it with a few caveats.</p>
<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully Alessio is right that the sequel can step things up this time around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus have been working together over the past year to create not one, but two new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. Both of these Xbox Ally devices, part of the Project Kennan effort I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/628073/microsoft-xbox-handheld-project-kennan-notepad">reported on earlier this year</a>, include a new full-screen Xbox experience on Windows that’s designed to be more handheld-friendly and hide away the complexity of Windows to focus on gaming instead.</p><p>The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 900p to 1080p gaming on the go. Like the existing ROG Ally and Ally X, the new Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share the same 7-inch 1080p screen, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and VRR support.</p><p>The Xbox Ally uses a previously unannounced AMD Ryzen Z2 A chip, combined with 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM and 512GB of M.2 2280 SSD storage. The Xbox Ally X upgrades the chip to AMD’s Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a 1TB M.2 2280 SSD.</p><p>All of these specs make them very similar to Asus’ existing Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs at heart, but there are some much-needed changes to the software side that could make the Windows handheld experience a lot better.</p><p>“We know that to take this handheld experience to the next level, we cannot do this alone,” says Shawn Yen, vice president of consumer at Asus, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em><strong>,</strong> admitting that some gamers have found it “frustrating and confusing” to navigate Windows with joysticks and button until now.</p><p>Microsoft and Asus have been collaborating closely on these two new Xbox Ally devices over the past year, and Yen says Microsoft and Asus “share a joint obsession” on these new handhelds.</p><p>That joint obsession includes Microsoft making good on its promise to combine “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the best of Xbox and Windows together</a>,” thanks to a new Xbox full-screen experience on Windows that’s designed specifically for handhelds. Not only can the Xbox Ally devices boot directly to this interface, but the companies claim you can easily get back to it using a new dedicated Xbox button on these handhelds, much like an Xbox console.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes in this full-screen Xbox experience, putting Windows firmly in the background and freeing up more memory for games. Instead, you launch straight into the Xbox PC app, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, and what Microsoft calls “other leading storefronts.”</p><p>This aggregated gaming library means you’ll see games from Xbox, Game Pass, and all your PC games installed from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere in a single interface, much like what the GOG launcher offers. Earlier this week, we started seeing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682235/xbox-pc-games-console-library-xbox-360">parts of this unified library appear</a> in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft says you’ll be able to access your full Xbox console library through Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play to an Xbox console.</p><p>The idea is that you should be able to seamlessly launch any game you own, whether it’s actually installed on your handheld, streaming from your Xbox Series X over home Wi-Fi, or streaming from the cloud, though we have yet to try that ourselves.</p><p>Microsoft has also made some additional tweaks to the Xbox PC app and Game Bar to make this all more handheld-friendly, including the ability to log in via the Windows lockscreen with your controller<strong>,</strong> no touchscreen taps required. You’ll also be able to use this handheld-friendly Game Bar interface to easily launch apps like Discord, or alt-tab between apps and games, or adjust settings without having to fiddle with the touchscreen. <a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=vm_preview_make&amp;post_id=682011">You can read all about all the Windows changes in my deep dive look at this new Xbox PC experience right here</a>.</p><p>These two Xbox Ally devices also have Xbox-like contoured grips. It’s as if Microsoft and Asus have taken an Xbox controller and squeezed a screen between the grips, similar to what Sony did with its PlayStation Portal. The grips have been designed like this to make it easier to wrap your hands around the entire controls, so you access all the buttons and triggers.</p><p>The Xbox Ally X even has impulse triggers like all modern Xbox controllers, so you’ll feel things like terrain of roads during racing games or the impact of bullets in a shooter, all thanks to the haptics on the triggers. Asus is also using a USB-C 4 connector that supports Thunderbolt 4 on the more powerful Xbox Ally X<strong>, </strong>offering the possibility of connecting a powerful external GPU to it, alongside a single USB-C 3.2 port and a UHS-II microSD card reader. The Xbox Ally uses two USB-C 3.2 ports instead.</p><p>Microsoft and Asus aren’t providing any benchmarks or a real sense of performance for these handhelds yet, and both use chips we haven’t tested. But interestingly, they appear to be focusing on battery life this time around.</p><p>“For this generation the most important thing to us is efficiency. Efficiency is our new superpower,” says Yen. “The games will be able to play cooler and quieter, and at the same time offer you a longer battery life for gameplay.” AMD told us in January that the Z2 Extreme would be both its most powerful and most efficient handheld chip yet, while <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-z2-a-said-to-be-based-on-steam-decks-van-gogh-apu">the Z2 A is rumored</a> to be based on the Steam Deck’s less powerful but battery-sipping Van Gogh-based chip.</p><p>Importantly, the Xbox Ally is using a 60Wh battery, 50 percent larger than the pack that shipped in the original ROG Ally, while the more powerful Xbox Ally X uses an 80Wh battery, tied with the Ally X and the largest you can find in a handheld today. The Windows tweaks may also improve battery, with Microsoft claiming it’s already seeing one-third of the drain when these Xbox Full Screen Experience systems are idle and asleep.</p><p>If you want extra performance, you’ll also be able to dock these Xbox Ally devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24336135/asus-thunderbolt-5-external-gpu-graphics-xg-mobile-ces-2025">to Asus’ XG mobile device</a> that offers up an RTX 5090 laptop GPU to overhaul how games play on these handheld devices.</p><p>These new Xbox Ally handhelds will launch during the holiday season later this year, and Microsoft and Asus are planning to share pricing and preorder information in the coming months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Asus have just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two ROG Xbox Ally devices</a> that include a new full-screen Xbox experience for handhelds. After promising to combine “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the best of Xbox and Windows together</a>” for handhelds earlier this year, Microsoft is now revealing exactly how it is overhauling the Xbox app, Game Bar, and Windows itself to better compete with SteamOS.</p><p>Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/676258/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-steamos-notepad">needed to respond to SteamOS</a> ever since the Steam Deck launched three years ago, and it has steadily been tweaking its Xbox app and the Xbox Game Bar on Windows to make both more handheld-friendly. But there was always a bigger overhaul of Windows required, and we’re starting to see parts of that today.</p><p>“The reality is that we’ve made tremendous progress on this over the last couple of years, and this is really the device that galvanized those teams and got everybody marching and working towards a moment that we’re just really excited to put into the hands of players,” says Roanne Sones, corporate vice president of gaming Devices and ecosystem at Xbox, in a briefing with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Microsoft demonstrated this handheld-friendly combination of Windows and Xbox to The Verge in a briefing earlier this week, but it was a virtual demo so we haven’t been able to try it fully yet. It all starts by booting directly into a new Xbox full-screen experience on these ROG Xbox Ally devices that focuses on the Xbox app and Game Bar, alongside being a launcher for all your PC games — yes even Steam ones.</p><p>“We were able to take people who have been working on the Xbox OS for 20 years or more and have them work directly on the Windows codebase and start reimagining what that operating system looks like for this form factor,” explains Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox. “These two things combined led us to build a bunch of features.”</p><p>The Xbox full-screen experience is very much the compact mode of the Xbox app taking full control of the ROG Xbox Ally devices, instead of the familiar Windows desktop and taskbar. “When the player boots into the full-screen experience there is a whole bunch of Windows stuff that doesn’t get loaded,” says Beaumont. “We’re not loading the desktop wallpaper, the taskbar, or a bunch of processes that are really designed around productivity scenarios for Windows.”</p><p>You can still exit this full-screen mode and launch the full version of the Windows desktop, but by default it will by hidden away. “We’ve reduced many notifications and pop-ups, and we will continue to listen to feedback from players to make continued improvements,” says Sones.</p><p>The Xbox app itself in full-screen mode looks very similar to what exists on Windows right now, except the library is now full of all of your PC games from Steam and other stores, alongside ones from Xbox Play Anywhere and Game Pass. Where it really gets interesting is the Game Bar.</p><p>“We’ve made a lot of improvements to Game Bar over the last year, and really it was driving towards this device,” says Brianna Potvin, principal software engineering lead at Xbox. A short press on the Xbox button on the Xbox Ally devices brings up the Game Bar interface, and you can use this to access device settings like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, Asus’ Command Center interface, and even Microsoft’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Gaming Copilot</a>. If you long press on the Xbox button then you’ll even get a more handheld-friendly task switcher, which lets you alt+tab between apps and games using the controller.</p><p>I’ll need to try this new interface fully to really get a feel for the Windows changes here, but Microsoft is promising that this isn’t just lipstick on top of Windows. “This isn’t surface-level changes, we’ve made significant improvements,” says Potvin. “Some of our early testing with the components we’ve turned off in Windows, we get about 2GB of memory going back to the games while running in the full-screen experience.”</p><p>That’s a good step to improve the performance of Windows on handhelds, but one of the big pieces of feedback around the handheld experience is the sleep situation where Windows-powered devices often draw far too much battery life when they’re idle.</p><p>“If you’re booting your device into the full-screen experience and you’re putting it down and it’s going to sleep, it draws one third of the idle power draw than if it was booting the same device into the [Windows] desktop experience,” claims Potvin. Microsoft is still focused on battery life and power efficiency for this full-screen mode, so we might even see further improvements before devices ship later this year. Microsoft has also made improvements to the Windows lockscreen, so you can now use a controller to log in using a PIN code, or navigate around in this part of Windows.</p><p>This updated Xbox app will now work as a launcher for all your PC games, but you’ll still be able to interact with Windows apps and those other launchers freely in this full-screen handheld experience. Sones says Microsoft is “working closely with leading storefronts to have them optimize their full screen experience,” to make it easy for everyone to play a full library of PC games from Steam, Epic Games Store, and elsewhere.</p><p>“The aggregated gaming library within Xbox on PC will be available for all Windows 11 devices,” says Sones, so you’ll soon be able to see all of your Steam games within the Xbox app on any PC.</p><p>Microsoft is also creating its own version of Valve’s Steam Deck verified program, allowing you to see what games are optimized for handhelds like the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. You’ll also be able to access your full Xbox console library on handhelds thanks to either Xbox Cloud Gaming or Remote Play from an Xbox console, but most console games won’t play natively unless there’s a PC version or they’re part of Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><p>The best part of all these Windows changes is that you won’t necessarily need a new device to benefit from them. “The Xbox full-screen experience will first come to the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X, and our next focus will be updating the in-market ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X,” says Sones. “Similar full-screen Xbox experiences will be rolling out to other Windows handhelds, starting next year.”</p><p>Valve is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">supporting SteamOS on the ROG Ally</a>, so we should be able to compare Valve and Microsoft’s handheld operating systems on the same hardware soon. We don’t yet know if Microsoft has done enough to stop other PC makers from being tempted over to SteamOS <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">like Lenovo has</a>, but Microsoft’s efforts are really setting up a battle between Windows and Linux for the future of handheld gaming PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here's a bit of story from the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>An endless rain of miasma hangs over a near-future Tokyo in the wake of an ancient enemy’s resurrection. The fate of the city lies in the hands of young ninja prodigy, Yakumo. Fighting his way through cybernetic ninja soldiers and otherworldly creatures, Yakumo must reconcile a destiny he shares with the legendary Ryu Hayabusa himself and free Tokyo from the ancient curse that brought the city to its knees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-ninja-announce-ninja-gaiden-4-and-theyre-getting-help-from-platinum">announced earlier this year</a> as a joint effort by Team Ninja and Platinum - an unholy alliance in character action games that should perhaps be made illegal. It's not the only game of face-obscuring sneakery being developed. The retro-styled action platformer Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-the-trailer-for-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-from-koei-tecmo-dotemu-and-the-blasphemous-team">unveiled late last year</a>, with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> devs in charge. Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-will-set-your-village-on-fire-as-is-only-proper">got to have bite</a> previously, and quite enjoyed what he played.

<p>Humour is, of course, subjective, but the main problem with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a> is that is just wasn't a very good shooter. Those guns talked the talk, but the walk felt plinky and limp. Not ideal if you want to present something as more than just a gimmick.</p>
<p>All this said, the animation itself was pretty fantastic, making this one of the rare cases where a cinematic trailer is probably a fair indication of what to expect. I should also say that Squanch are no doubt full of talented and hardworking folk who bear no responsibility for Roiland himself. If this means moving on from his particular brand of anti-humour and making High On Life 2 their own, all the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
