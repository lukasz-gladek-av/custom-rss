                <p>Pokemon fans are known to be passionate, especially as Pokemania nears its 30th anniversary in 2026. Sometimes, fans are even willing to pay shockingly high prices for unofficial Pokemon items, including--of all things--a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that bears more than a little resemblance to Charizard. "Cheetozard" recently went up for auction, and the highest bid has already cleared four figures.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/526839/cheeto-charizard-auction-pokemon-collectibles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this Charizard-shaped Cheeto is currently available to anyone with a large amount of expendable income <a href="https://goldin.co/item/cheetozard-pokemon-charizard-shaped-cheeto-370g3p?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOTEzN2RlNjJiOWFiM2Y0ZmFjNzQxODkyYzFkZmI1ZWMiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjd9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Goldin auctions</a>. At press time, the highest bid is $2,100, and there are still eight more days before the auction comes to a close.</p><p>According to the auction description, Cheetozard was "discovered and preserved sometime between 2018-2022 by 1st &amp; Goal Collectibles." It comes with a custom-made Cheetozard card inside of a clear storage box. It's a very amusing novelty item, but probably not for everyone.</p><p>Next week, The Pokemon Company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-february-27/1100-6529609/" data-ref-id="1100-6529609">be hosting a Pokemon Presents Livestream</a>, and fans have already speculated that the franchise's next Switch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, will be featured. Meanwhile, Pokemon Go developer Niantic is reportedly in negotiations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">to sell its gaming division to Saudi Arabia's Scopely</a>. This weekend, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gos-unova-tour-in-la-will-go-on-but-niantic-is-monitoring-wildfires/1100-6528751/" data-ref-id="1100-6528751">Pokemon Go Unova Tour - Los Angeles event</a> is being held in Pasadena, CA. Prior to the start of that event, The Pokemon Company and Niantic pledged a collective donation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-and-niantic-pledge-1-million-for-los-angeles-fire-relief/1100-6529506/" data-ref-id="1100-6529506">$1 million for Los Angeles wildfire relief</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date "03.04.25." Now, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.</p><p>The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he has been in contact with Activision</a> about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the long-running franchise will continue</a>.</p><p>If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer</a>. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. Hawk has obviously moved on to better accommodations since then, but we're eager to see where the video game series can go with the full power of the current gen consoles.</p>

The tabletop publisher's digital event was packed with new board game announcements and ongoing support for various beloved franchises. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The RenegadeCon 2025 Board Game Announcements</h2>

<p>During a Twitch livestream, Renegade Game Studios began RenegadeCon 2025 with new board game announcements. They were then collected into a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-con-february-2025-reveals-recap/" rel="nofollow">recap blog post</a> on their official site.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monsters-menace-the-world-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=dz7PIUJd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monsters-menace-the-world-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=ffDpO25k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first board game announced was <em>Monsters Menace The World</em>. A game where two to four players play as gigantic monsters as they terrorize the world and gain infamy. In addition, each player controls a Military faction dedicated to slowing down the monsters' rampage. Whoever has the most infamy wins. It is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $55. The game will be released in June.</p>

<p>The second RenegadeCon 2025 announcement is a new twist on an old classic. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> has players join either GI Joe or Cobra as they complete missions across a world map. There are multiple twists on the Risk formula here, including a focus on completing multiple objectives instead of world domination. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $70.</p>

<p>Third is a revised edition of the board game, <em>Sentient</em>. One to four players play as cutting-edge robotics companies. You'll compete against one another calibrating AI networks, and striking deals with investors, all to kick off the sentient robot revolution. This update to the 2017 original release includes a new solo mode and an updated game board. Sentient is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $40.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skara-brae-board-game-renegadecon-2025-cover.jpg?itok=7QNo5Dwo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skara-brae-board-game-renegadecon-2025-cover.jpg?itok=cQycCMBM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who enjoy more survival-focused board games, RenegadeCon 2025 has you covered with <em>Skara Brae</em> by Garphill Games. This game is set in the Orkney Islands of ancient Scotland. Players must gather resources to feed, clothe, and shelter your growing number of settlers. <em>Skara Brae</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $60.</p>

<p>Another Garphill Games project announced was <em>The Anarchy</em>. This Medieval-themed board game is set after the death of King Henry I with players in the role of nobles loyal to the swiftly inaugurated King Stephen de Blois. During this chaotic era, Players must build their domain, defend their castle from attack, and storm strongholds loyal to Empress Matilda.</p>

<p>Whoever proves they are the most brave and loyal to King Stephen wins the game. <em>The Anarchy</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $65.</p>

<p>Of course, RenegadeCon 2025 wouldn't be complete without new material coming to World of Darkness.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade Rivals</em> is getting a second Royalty Pack (MSRP $15), commemorating winners from past Prince of the City tournaments. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-reveals-werewolf-apocalypse-fifth-edition-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse</em></a> V5 is getting a new sourcebook, <em>Wyrmtide</em>, packed with new player options, story seeds, and enemies. <em>Wyrmtide</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $45.</p>

This deck contains all Gifts and Rites from the <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse Core Book</em>, the <em>Storyteller's Toolkit</em>, and the <em>Shattered Nation</em> sourcebook. The <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse Gift and Rite</em> deck is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $25.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em> TTRPG</a> is getting a new supplement based on the <em>Transformers One</em> feature film. It will contain new player options and locations based on the feature film, including playing as Bots looking to gain their own T-Cog, alongside new threats and locations on the surface of Cybertron like the Iacon 5000. The <em>Transformers One</em> supplement is available for pre-order for $40.</p>

Reading between the lines, the suggestion is that even if Nagoshi’s next game does make it out the door, it won’t get the red carpet rollout fans would hope for, or a new IP might be needed in order to have a chance of standing out in an ever more crowded field. </p><p>NetEase  acquired Grasshopper Manufacture, the studio behind cult-hits <em>Let It Die</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966">back in 2021 as well</a></span>.

Barrett argued his firing was "unfounded" and accused Bungie and Sony of firing him to avoid giving him a $45 million payout from his employee agreement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony's response counters Barrett's accusations, saying the investigation against him revealed his "consistent" behavior toward the unnamed employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"He&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower-level, female&nbsp;employee&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the&nbsp;employee&nbsp;by making subtle references to her physical appearance&nbsp;or expressing&nbsp;his interest&nbsp;in her romantically," the response begins.

His alleged behavior "made multiple female employees who were subordinate to him&nbsp;feel&nbsp;uncomfortable, fear retaliation, and&nbsp;feel&nbsp;victimized&nbsp;by their encounters with&nbsp;him.&nbsp;This&nbsp;impeded their ability to perform their job duties and thereby hindered [our] business operations."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Legal representatives for Barrett told Game File that Sony continues to "disingenuously cherrypick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. [...] Nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Barret has previously argued Bungie had a history of workplace toxicity that he was witness to.

Marvels Rivals, which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year, reportedly almost didn't make it to release. It's claimed the company considered cancelling the project because its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">according to a new Bloomberg report</a> detailing NetEase chief exective officer William Ding's recent strategic upheaval - which has included sweeping jobs cuts, studio closures, and a pulling back on international investment - amid slow growth for the company and a decline in topline results over the last two and a half years.
</p>
<p>
It's claimed Marvel Rivals - which has reportedly now generated over $200m for NetEase since its launch last December - was also in Ding's sights prior to its release. According to Bloomberg, discussions of its cancellation arose after Ding objected to paying Disney for the use of its popular Marvel characters - with the CEO at one point reportedly asking artists to swap in NetEase's own character designs. Those efforts were eventually abandoned.

The decision - described as being "emblematic of the abrupt changes ushered in by the CEO" by Bloomberg's sources - is said to have ultimately cost NetEase millions of dollars, although a spokesperson denied the account in a statement shared with the publication, insisting the company had "enjoyed a close partnership with Marvel" since 2017.

Over the last year, Ding's shifting strategy has impacted multiple studios in the west. In November, for instance, BioWare veteran Mac Walters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">announced a "pause" in operations</a> at his NetEase-backed Worlds Untold, and Jar of Sparks - a first-party NetEase developer founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work in January</a>, laying off staff. 
</p>
<p>
This week also saw NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a week Microsoft has had. On one hand, it published a clear game of the year contender in <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avowed</em></a>, a fantasy role-playing game jam-packed with surprises and inventive touches. On the other, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Muse</a>, a game-making tool no one asked for that serves as additional proof that generative AI’s time is running out. The contrast here is stark: <em>Avowed </em>is such a revelatory experience in large part because its world feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously crafted</a> by a human team with a specific vision in mind. Tools like Muse threaten to displace those people. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode champing at the bit to talk about <em>Avowed</em>, but first, The News: NetEase shocked the game-playing public by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off</a> members of the team behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the biggest breakout success story to come out of the live service sector in years. What happened? Well, decaying relations between the United States and China, for one, but also a seismic <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shift in how Chinese companies are developing games</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss Microsoft’s new Muse AI, which it intends on shoehorning into game development projects – a plan you will not be surprised to learn that nobody likes! Game developers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least of all</a>! This is especially pertinent considering that Microsoft just published <em>Avowed</em>, a fantasy role-playing game that’s so good because it was crafted by human hands in a way that feels tangible for every second of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We then talk about all the things we like about <em>Avowed</em>: The world design, the combat, the (slightly wonky) progression, and even the fact that your main character is a weird-looking cop who everyone regards with suspicion. Lastly, we decide which game console would work best as a house (Gamecube for humans, PlayStation 4 or 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for roaches</a>).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can write so many blogs about <em>Avowed </em>that companies will finally attempt to succeed at the Video Game Industry Value People Challenge (Impossible).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Microsoft] might as well just be an AI company at this point. They have services – whatever. The degree to which Microsoft is all in on this shit is so troubling that I worry from an existential perspective what happens when it all drops out. I wonder what happens to the game studios, I wonder what happens to Xbox, I wonder what happens to the very good games they seem to be investing in. It’s gonna tank a lot of things, and I know it’s small-minded to narrow it down to just this thing, but I’m looking at what’s in front of me, and I don’t want to lose that.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways. Not Phil Spencer’s performance and input specifically, but just the packaging around the whole thing suggests that Microsoft is so overextended on AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> They’ve got to put it in everything, in every corner of their business.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yep. “Xbox, it’s your turn. You need to come up with something. We need a name for it. We need some videos. Sell AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The crux of all of this – and this was true with <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s AI demonstration last year</a>, too; the one with all the cardboard boxes that looked like dogshit – is that companies keep going back to this notion of “We’re going to give you something that will help you come up with ideas.” That’s the one thing nobody is lacking! There are so many ideas! There are too many ideas!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Have you ever talked to a stranger at GameStop? They will give you ideas for video games unprompted.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Admittedly, they’re not very good, but…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, often with the caveat of “I don’t know how to program or do much of anything, but…” But there’s no shortage of imagination. It’s not the expensive thing you need to automate. This is the thing: Games are so hard to make well that all they have is, like, a Magic Eight Ball or whatever the fuck they’re coming up with. It’s bad.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s especially pertinent because we’ve all been playing <em>Avowed</em>, and one of the standout qualities of it is that it feels very deliberately handcrafted. You can feel the human touch of that entire studio everywhere you go in that game. And I saw somebody on Bluesky talking about it last night, saying that, in some ways, because it feels so designed, it does add this element of artificiality to it. It feels like a video game. But that’s not a bad thing in this case. I think it really accentuates the game's positive qualities.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The number one way they’re probably describing that is that you associate a game in that engine and in this setting with being a sprawling open-world <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Witcher </em>kind of thing where you can ride your horse or walk around for days on end and not see anything.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And you have all these big, empty landscapes.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>This is a theme park RPG. This is a small open world, and you cannot walk over a hill or turn a corner without running into someone who’s in trouble or a bunch of mushroom monsters or something like that. There’s no vast wilderness here. There’s something everywhere. Because it’s not trying to be a realistic landscape, it’s like “This is a video game. You’ve got swords and spells, and you want to hit shit, and you want to kill things, and you want to save people. We are gonna put this stuff everywhere, and it’s gonna be super cool because you can do something at all times.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And [Obsidian is basically saying] “It’s gonna be so rich with things that we have written, that matter to us to convey.” The fact that that is everywhere, that it suffuses the whole project, is indicative of where their priorities lie compared to these other open-world games that are very big and sprawling but are maybe lacking in substance in other areas.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-obsidian-magic-gun-combat"><h3>I Love Being A Gun-Wielding Wizard In Avowed</h3></a><p>The only thing more fun than talking my way out of problems is shooting people.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-dei-remove-website-cowards"><h3>IGN’s Parent Company Ziff Davis Removes ‘DEI’ Mentions From Its Website</h3></a><p>Some sections mentioning diversity 'have been removed from the website entirely'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rivera also officially revealed some new features coming to 2XKO. One major change will see the game's Pulse Fuse (which enables beginner-friendly autocombos) removed. However, autocombo functionality will instead be added as a toggleable option in the game's settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Rivera said this was done for two reasons. The first was so players could take advantage of the game's powerful Fuses while still using autocombos. The other reason is so that when playing as a team, each player could go with their own autocombo preference instead of being locked into using them or not via the Pulse Fuse.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an entirely new Fuse coming, Sidekick, that will actually remove the tag functionality from Riot's tag-based fighter. Sidekick makes it so a team's point and assist character can't swap places, with the point character gaining bonus health to make up for the fact that they can't be tagged out. It essentially turns one character, or one player if playing co-op, into a support character only capable of using assist attacks, in a way channeling one of the core roles from League of Legends itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We received a ton of feedback from players who wanted an experience that felt like more of a support role where they could learn the game at their own pace, and we are excited to hear what you all think when you get a chance to check it out in the future," Rivera said.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO, which will be free-to-play, is slated to release sometime in 2025 but does not have an official release date. Players got their first major hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-alpha-lab-playtest-players-can-expect-a-decent-amount-of-jank-riot-says/1100-6525611/" data-ref-id="1100-6525611">2XKO as part of its Alpha Lab playtest in August 2024</a>, which was live for a little over a week. At the time, Riot warned players the playtest would have a "decent amount of jank" and work-in-progress elements. Those interested in joining future playtests can sign-up on the 2XKO <a href="https://alpha.2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

You just have to power past that feeling," he said.</p><p>Part of what creates anxiety for Druckmann is the scope and scale of any given project, including staff and large budgets. "There's all this pressure," he said. "There's no formula for how to succeed. You can never guarantee success. All you can do is follow your instincts, follow the advice the team gives you, trust the process," he said.</p><p>The "process" for Naughty Dog is how the studios works together and vets ideas, Druckmann said, as well as iterating again and again.</p><p>"We know that our first idea is never the best one. We have to get to the seventh one to get something interesting, something unique. The first few, you've heard of it. It's something you've seen before," he said. "That's how you start to dig deeper. We know we’ll have to throw work away. That's part of our process. At times that can be frustrating for people, members of the team, ourselves. But going through it over and over again, that's how you get past your doubts. Doubt will always be there."</p><p>Druckmann also mentioned how having a schedule is critical to his working process, even if he might not personally enjoy sticking to a strict schedule. "I need it. The team needs it as well, because--it's not unique to me. It's just Naughty Dog. We're perfectionists. Without it we would just keep iterating," Druckmann said.</p><p>Druckmann is now directing Naughty Dog's new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while he may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us 3</a>. Beyond games, Druckmann worked alongside Craig Mazin on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-finally-sets-a-date-for-the-last-of-us-season-2/1100-6529601/" data-ref-id="1100-6529601">The Last of Us Season 2, which comes to HBO in April.</a></p>
