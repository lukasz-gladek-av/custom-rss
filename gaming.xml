<p>RV There Yet? is a co-op game where players are travelling in their RV back from a vacation, but run into all sorts of issues on Route 65. Players need to find ways to survive this route and get their RV across challenge terrain, sometimes needing to winch it or jump it across gaps and up heights when there is road to follow. The RV does get damaged so finding scrap in the wild is also essential to keep it moving, lest you get trapped on Route 65 and never make it home.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">After yesterday's news from Circana</a> outlining how November 2025 was one of the worst months for US physical game sales and hardware sales in 30 years, Newzoo's report on the global industry is a reminder that, at least on the consumer side, things are still trending in a positive direction. Issues like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">tariffs, the rising cost of living</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/after-dell-acer-asus-have-surrendered-to-memory-shortages/">now memory shortages</a> could have more of an impact in 2026, but as of the end of 2025, Newzoo expects the global games market to rise 7.5% compared to 2024 when all the 2025 numbers are tallied.</p>



<p>That's an increase to <strong>$197 billion</strong>, with mobile games expected to grow to  <strong>$108 billion (a 7.7%</strong> <strong>increase)</strong>, console gaming expected to hit <strong>$45 billion (a 4.2% increase), </strong>and PC gaming expected to grow to <strong>$43 billion (a 10.4% increase)</strong>. The PC and mobile growth is what exceeded Newzoo's expectations, and the key drivers behind the expected growth getting to just shy of $200B, though, if growth continues in the way Newzoo predicts, the industry will be far past $200B by next year.</p>

<p>While Newzoo expects mobile to remain strong due to its stock of ol'reliable titles from publishers like Tencent and Century Games and the momentum perpetuated by new hits, much like how the console industry is kept up by the routine and habits of console gamers going back to major franchises each year, growth on PC is a bit more interesting. </p>



<p>That's exemplified in the top 10 games on PC by revenue for the year. Some of the games are major franchises, but none of them are free-to-play titles, and all of them are games that were released in 2025. "<em>The 2025 outcome reflects players spending more deeply within games and ecosystems they already value, rather than growth being driven by a sudden expansion of the player base</em>," said principal market analyst, Michiel Buijsman.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Two of the top 10 are indie titles, and three of the top 10 are brand new games not based on a pre-existing franchise on PC, which Newzoo says is "<em>reflecting a broad appetite for varied experiences</em>" and <em>"PC's relative openness to new IP and system-driven design</em>." It's also further signs that, while console games may take centre stage more often as far as what hits the mainstream, PC is still where the core industry is. </p>



<p>On console, the top 10 does clear one of the same bars that the PC list clears, which is that they're all games released in 2025, but none of them are indie titles or new franchises. They're all major franchises, and half the list are even annual releases. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Newzoo-Year-in-Review-Report-Jan-Nov-2025-2.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>EA is the winningest publisher with nearly half the list in its portfolio, though perhaps the most impressive inclusion is Pokemon Legends Z-A, which made it despite only being available on one platform.</p>



<p>Both of those lists are tallied by revenue, whereas the engagement lists (tallied by monthy active users) for PC and console are a different story. Only one of the titles in the top 10 on PC isn't based on a pre-existing franchise, while all of the games on the console list for the top 10 games by MAUs are major franchises.</p>



<p>As a side note, the top 10 console games by MAUs is in fact the only list in Newzoo's report where Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 makes the top 10. Battlefield 6 is still in that top 10, and made it on every the revenue and MAU list for both PC and consoles. It's still early of course, but at this point it feels safe to call it: Battlefield beat Call of Duty in 2025, and there's practically no question about it.</p>

</figure>



<p>Lastly, the final key points from Newzoo's report, as it looks back at 2025 and towards the future to 2026, is that indie games were a huge factor in this year's industry conversation, largely due to successes like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which capped off its stellar year by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">winning a record number of awards at The Game Awards, including Game of the Year</a>. </p>



<p>And as we look ahead, 2025's most significant moves, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">like EA moving to privatize</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's opening of Vantage Studios</a> mean that the industry is going through a massive shift. "<em>The EA deal reflects a broader structual shift toward ownership concentration and tighter portfolio management,</em>" said Manu Rosier, director of market intelligence at Newzoo.</p>



<p>"<em>A smaller number of companies now control a larger share of the industry's most influential IP, while platforms increasingly shape which games are funded, distributed, and scaled</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune Awakening Chapter 3 Brings ‘Bigger, Better’ Endgame, New Content and Lots More, Says Funcom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-chapter-3-brings-bigger-better-endgame-new-content-and-more/</link>
            <guid>1387168</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has unveiled Dune Awakening Chapter 3, an upcoming update for its survival crafting game set in the world based on Frank Herbert's novels and Denis Villeneuve's movies.</p>



<p>Dune Awakening launched in June 2025 on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling one million copies in a couple of weeks</a> and becoming Funcom's fastest-selling game release to date. However, it was quickly evident that there wasn't enough content, and a lot of players left the game after a short while.</p>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Game Director Joel Bylos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told me</a> the team wasn't worried, as the core is among the best games in the genre and it just needed more content and fixes. Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a>, that's exactly what Funcom plans to add to Dune Awakening, starting with Chapter 3.</p>



<p>First and foremost, the developers aim to deliver a 'bigger, better' endgame, powered by a comprehensive redesign of the Tier 6 experience. Players will find deeper progression choices and more meaningful advancement paths, thanks to specializations dedicated to Crafting, Gathering, Exploring, Combat, and Sabotage. This will allow non‑combat focused players to progress endgame content without forced PvP or dungeon raiding.</p>



<p>The Landraad system, Dune Awakening's server-wide political system where player guilds align with the Great Houses (Atreides, Harkonnen), complete weekly tasks, and vote on decrees that affect everyone on the server, has reportedly been remade from scratch and now features new repeatable missions, expanded reward tiers, and stronger incentives for participation. The Faction ranks progression has been extended, too. There will be new contracts specific to each faction's objectives (Atreides, Harkonnen, independent groups). </p>



<p>A completely new Augmentation Station is being introduced as an upgrade path for late‑game gear customization. Players will be able to attach powerful augments to Unique Tier 6 gear to customize their playstyle further. On the PvE side, Funcom is adding five brand-new overland 'challenge sites', including 'The Broodworks'. Completing these areas provides faction progress, increases Landsraad contribution, and grants Specialization XP. Furthermore, Dune Awakening Chapter 3 will introduce five new Testing Stations. These are repeatable, dungeon-like content featuring boss fights, increasing difficulty and appropriately valuable rewards. </p>



<p>The story is going forward, too. The player's narrative journey will continue with the introduction of unexpected allies, fighting through the Neo Carthag dueling ring, and delving deeper into the mystery of the player character's origins. When it comes to combat, the Rapier is being fully reworked, and a new 'Pyrocket' melee weapon (dual-wielded knives) will be available with the update.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside Dune Awakening Chapter 3, Funcom will launch the paid Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, which can be purchased for $9.99 (but is included with the $24.99 Season Pass). Its additions are cosmetic-only: 73 new building pieces and 17 decorations inspired by the Imperium's Smugglers, a dedicated stillsuit set, a light and heavy armor set, weapon variants, swatches, and emotes.</p>



<p>The game is available at a 35% discount, the largest one yet since launch, in the Steam Winter Sale that starts today. Funcom did not share a timeframe for Chapter 3 and the Raiders of the Broken Lands DLC, but more details should be released in early 2026. Later next year, the game is supposed to launch on consoles as well.</p>

For anyone seeking a powerful yet lightweight laptop, this offer is hard to beat.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="384" data-end="408"><strong data-start="384" data-end="408">Everyday Performance</strong></h2>
<p data-start="410" data-end="999">The 15.3-inch 2025 MacBook Air continues to be a top pick for users who value portability without compromising on performance. Weighing just 3.3 pounds and maintaining a sleek, slim design, this model upholds the Air’s tradition of ultra-light form while delivering performance on par with larger devices. Despite its compact size, Apple has equipped it with a 10-core CPU, an optional 10-core GPU, and support for up to 24GB of memory. With the new M4 chip, this MacBook Air offers speeds up to twice as fast as the M1-era model and up to 23 times faster than Intel-powered versions.</p>
<p data-start="1001" data-end="1291">Apple designed the M4 chip with Apple Intelligence in mind, optimizing the system for task management, efficient processing, and the ability to handle intensive workflows.

The built-in three-microphone array ensures clear audio, so you don’t need external equipment to be heard clearly.</p>


<p data-start="1782" data-end="2222">The fully backlit keyboard makes it easy to type in low-light conditions, while Touch ID offers quick and secure access to the laptop. On the sides, there are two Thunderbolt ports for fast data transfer and peripheral connectivity. The MagSafe charging port ensures your power cable remains securely attached but detaches safely if pulled. Apple has also kept the headphone jack—great for anyone who still prefers wired audio devices.</p>
<p data-start="2224" data-end="2430">For those fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem, the MacBook Air offers seamless features like AirDrop, iMessage syncing, and Handoff, allowing for smooth transitions between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p data-start="2432" data-end="2790"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6483/">The MacBook Air is available in several configurations, all of which are currently discounted. The 256GB model, priced at $949, offers a $250 savings</a>. The 512GB model is priced at $1,149, also reflecting a $250 reduction. For those needing more memory, the 24GB RAM and 512GB storage configuration has dropped by $250, bringing it down to $1,349 from $1,599.</p>
<p data-start="2792" data-end="3057" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The MacBook Air is also available in four stylish colors: sky blue, silver, starlight, and midnight. With its impressive performance, ultra-portable design, and generous discounts, the 2025 MacBook Air is a standout option for anyone in the market for a new laptop—especially right now while its $250 off.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light 2’s New Winter Update Includes Beastly ‘Evolving’ Bundle]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-winter-update-evolving-bundle/</link>
            <guid>1387156</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland is pushing out the first major update for Dying Light 2: Stay Human for some time. Now that Dying Light: The Beast is in the open and doing well, the team has reverted to focus more on the live-service Dying Light 2, which was released back in 2022. The new winter update is dubbed ‘Winter Tales: Gifts from Above 2025’, and it comes with some neat content.</p>



<p>This fresh update also boasts a new bundle called <strong>The Evolving Bundle</strong>. It’s an interactive set that gets better once you’ve bought it, with the various items in the set <em>evolving </em>and taking on new forms.</p>







<h2 id="h-winter-has-come-to-villedor">Winter Has Come to Villedor</h2>



<p>The festive theme lands in Villedor once a year, blanketing the map in challenges, exclusive rewards, and seasonal activities.</p>



<p>In a new press release published by Techland, the return of <strong>Baka </strong>was highlighted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Baka is back in the Villedor</strong>&nbsp;with a set of new bounties for players to complete, progressing with him will unlock items in his shop based on the level players are at. These items can be bought with Candies collected from killing seasonal zombie enemies – including Naughty Biters, Naughty Bolters, Naughty Virals, Uncle Snow, and Ice Spitters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you complete enough challenges, you’ll get your ‘Letter to Santa’ from Baka, which triggers a special airdrop guarded by fearsome enemies.</p>



<p>From today, December 18, community goals are being kick-started to allow players access to even more gear. Here’s the spread of challenges coming up:</p>



<ul>
<li>December 18 – December 23 – Week 1: Kill Naughty Biters – rewards include the Glacier Shank Knife and Snow Season Ornament Charm</li>



<li>December 23 – December 30 – Week 2: Kill Naughty Virals – rewards include The Guiding Star Mace and Gift Season Ornament Charm.&nbsp;</li>



<li>December 30 – January 8 – Week 3: Kill Uncle Snow – rewards include the Fractal Frost Axe&nbsp;and New Year’s Ornament Charm.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the more unique elements of the Winter Update in Dying Light 2: Stay Human is the new <strong>Evolving Bundle</strong>. This has been dubbed ‘the first of its kind’, suggesting that more are coming, and this is why it’s so important for fans of the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The first bundle of that kind is the&nbsp;<strong>Night Wolf Evolving Bundle</strong>&nbsp;which evolves into the Crimson Werewolf set as players progress through a four-part questline. This way players can acquire two versions of a powerful rifle, an outfit, six gear pieces, and a paraglider skin. The bundle also contains the Wolf’s Claws melee weapon and an exclusive grappling hook variant.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As you play the new questline, you’ll see your weapons and equipment evolving before your eyes, which is a super neat touch.</p>



<p>This announcement was made in addition to the team at Techland highlighting big discounts across the Dying Light franchise, which includes Dying Light: The Beast being up to 20% off right now.</p>

            <p>The first episode of Fallout's second season debuted yesterday, and within its hour or so run time solved one of the biggest cut content mysteries from New Vegas, which had been left unanswered for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two episode one below.</strong></p>

<p>Along with introducing some new faces, the second season of Fallout also reunites us with the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, who left together at the end of season one on the trail of disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean. Hank, meanwhile, was last seen fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour.</p>
<p>And, that brings us to the first episode of season two, with Lucy and The Ghoul following the bloody trail Hank has left in his wake. This includes a little stop off at Vault 24, a cut location from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. We only know about this place because players discovered a Vault 24 jumpsuit tucked away in New Vegas' game files, which could only be found using console commands</p><p>Now, as I am sure you are aware if you have read this far, many of the vaults in Fallout - both the show and the games - were set up to conduct experiments and such within. This has included the TV show's Vault 4, which experimented with mutants, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Vault 63, which was set up by Vault-Tec's Hugo Stolz and his wife as a research facility for various technologies that would help with setting up post-War societies. There was also that poor chap that got put into Vault 77 totally on his own save for some puppets.</p>
<p>So, what was tucked away in Fallout: New Vegas' Vault 24? For a long time it seemed likely we would never know, but, thanks to Amazon's show, we now have an answer. And that answer is… communists! When Lucy and The Ghoul step into the vault, which is now derelict and covered in vegetation, they come across skeletons strapped down in front of a propaganda video, which when they were alive would have been brainwashing the poor chaps.</p>
<p>These aren't the only skeletons that were left to rot in the vault. Lucy and The Ghoul find many more strapped down within Vault 24, with pseudo-Soviet gear about the place. "These are Americans," Lucy realises, "and the Vault turned them into communists."</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty odd thing for the Vault-Tec heads to have done, but to be fair, when did they ever do anything that couldn't be labelled as pretty odd? (Again, that poor man with the puppets). On further exploration, Lucy and The Ghoul come across someone alive down there. A Wastelander with a chip in his head like the one House used at the start of the episode, which allowed him to control a goon's mind, is sitting strapped down and clearly not of sound mind.</p><p>This mind controlling chip is what Hank went into the vault to get a hold of, though it still needs some work to perfect, as so far the only people we have seen with the chips in their heads have not lived very long… that's probably a plot thread for another episode.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. After 15 years, we now know what's in Vault 24.</p>

<p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode airing in February of next year.</p>
<p>The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-does-final-price-cut-of-year-on-xbox-controllers-nearly-50-off-and-makes-sonys-look-overpriced-2000654527</link>
            <guid>1387111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">cut the price of its 2025 Xbox wireless controller on Amazon to $38</a>, which is the lowest price ever for hardware that just came out. That’s a $26 discount off the $64 list price, and here’s the best part: it’s a lot cheaper than Sony’s DualSense (currently selling for $54, down from $74). Yes, these controllers were made for different consoles, but if you play games on your PC or on more than one device, this price makes the Xbox controller the clear choice. Just so you know, Amazon’s shipping estimates say that the package <strong>won’t arrive until after Christmas</strong>, so this is better for treating yourself than for giving as a last-minute gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Important for More Than Just Gaming</h2>
<p>The 2025 Xbox controller has some smart changes that make long gaming sessions feel less like finger workouts and more like natural extensions of your hands. Microsoft changed the shape of the geometry by adding sculpted surfaces that fit your grip better which may seem like a small change, but after holding the thing for three hours straight during a marathon session, you’ll see how big of a difference it makes. The hybrid D-pad gives you choices based on the game you’re playing and it has the accuracy of separate buttons and the smooth motion of a disc-style pad. The triggers, bumpers, and back case now have textured grips on them, so your controller won’t turn into a bar of soap when your hands get sweaty during intense moments.</p>
<p>With two AA batteries, the battery life can last up to 40 hours so you can play for weeks without needing to change them. That’s a lot better than controllers with built-in rechargeable batteries that wear out over time and make you play while connected to a cable. You have to carry extra batteries, but honestly, it only takes five seconds to change AAs instead of waiting hours for a charge and if you don’t like disposable batteries, you can also get rechargeable AA packs.</p>



<p>The new Share button is easy to find on the controller face and lets you take screenshots and recordings without having to search through menus or remember button combinations. This feature works directly with Xbox’s capture system, which makes making content feel less like a chore and more like something you’ll actually use. Streaming to friends or social media becomes something that everyone can do, not just people who make content for a living.</p>



<p>You can connect to almost any device you own: Xbox Wireless technology works right away with Xbox Series X, Series S, and Xbox One consoles while <strong>Bluetooth works with Windows PCs, Android phones, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. The pairing button makes it easy to switch between devices in seconds, so you can go from playing games on your console to playing games on your phone without having to go through settings menus. The 3.5mm headset jack works with any wired headphones or gaming headset you already have, so you don’t have to deal with proprietary adapters.</p>
<p>The Xbox Accessories app lets you change the functions of buttons to fit your playstyle or meet your accessibility needs. Players of racing games can change the functions of the back buttons to work with paddle shifters, and players of fighting games can move the functions of the face buttons around to make combos faster. You can use the app on Xbox consoles and Windows PCs.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth: A brand-new 2025 controller with a 40-hour battery life, compatibility with all devices, and ergonomic improvements for $38 is a great deal. Third-party controllers that are similar often skimp on build quality or don’t have official firmware support. On the other hand, first-party controllers from competitors are usually between $50 and $70, even when they’re on sale.</p>

In February 2024, she <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-new-president-previously-oversaw-call-of-duty/1100-6520673/" data-ref-id="1100-6520673">became the president of Blizzard, replacing Mike Ybarra.</a></p><p>Officially speaking, Blizzard has said it has "major" reveals for the BlizzCon opening ceremony.

                <p>Actor Neil Newbon, who voiced Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, and he didn't mince words.</p><p>"Fuck AI in performance," Newbon told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/astarion-neil-newbon-ai-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>.</p><p>He's talking about using artificial voice lines for games, like how Embark's The Finals and Arc Raiders do. For Arc Raiders, the studio hired human actors to record voice lines and then used AI systems to have their voices say lots of other things. Newbon pointed out that Arc Raiders has been a major commercial success, and he suggested that Embark bring back the actors to "redo the lines."</p><p>"Maybe go back to those actors you paid however much money to clone their voices; maybe get them in the booth and re-record that stuff. Just saying. You've got the money now, spread the wealth," he said.</p><p>"I don't think there's a justification for taking people's jobs away," he added. "I don't really think it's legitimate. If you're going to not record the lines in the first place and just use AI to take somebody's voice and manipulate it however the hell you want, that's a problem."</p><p>"Most actors, notoriously, are not rich. Most of us struggle [for] our entire career," he said.</p><p>Embark has not disclosed the names of the voice performers in Arc Raiders, nor do we know their level of compensation. But Newbon said most actors are "not rich" and "struggle for our entire career."</p><p>Beyond all of this, Newbon said AI-created voice lines, as they exist today, simply sound "boring."</p><p>"It's dull as hell. I don't <em>believe</em> it; it takes me out of the immersion. People are saying it helps the immersion because it's reactive. It takes me out of the experience because I just hear something that doesn't sound like a human being in jeopardy, or in combat, or excitement, or whatever emotion you're supposed to be aiming for," he said.</p><p>Next up for Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is a new Divinity game. The company's CEO, Swen Vincke, recently discussed how the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">uses AI technologies in early-stage development efforts</a>, but promised that nothing AI-created will appear in the final product. His comments caused a stir, prompting Vincke to respond, saying Larian is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">hiring more people, not fewer</a>, and that AI is used to explore possibilities and not for actual production.</p>

            <guid>1387084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If a workstation refresh is what you’re after, Amazon is making the upgrade easy. The retailer is offering some great discounts on multiple tech gadgets, PCs, laptops, tablets, headphones, and more. Those looking to grab a mini PC should consider the Kamrui Hyper H2, which is currently sitting at $510.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">That’s after a nice 38% discount, but that’s not the only offer here</a>. Using the code <em><strong>JEG1HLJI7VJK</strong></em> at checkout can save you an additional 10%, which brings the total down even further. Moreover, shipping is free, so there are no extra charges to worry about. Just note the discount is listed as a limited-time one at Amazon, which means it’s likely going to wrap up soon. We suggest acting fast to grab it before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small But Mighty</h2>
<p>This mini PC is compact; so much so that it fits in the palm of your hand. At just 5.04 x 5.04 x 1.63 inches, it’s a fraction of the size of a traditional desktop, which makes it easy to fit into a tighter space. In fact, it can even be mounted behind your PC or under the desk for a cleaner, minimal look.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. The PC packs a muscular, 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor, capable of hitting speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavy-duty, resource-intensive tasks, and offers 25–40% higher performance than the R7-8745HS (8C/16T) and i7-1280P processors. The 13th Gen hybrid architecture here distributes workloads efficiently, which results in better response times and a smoother operation, regardless of the job at hand. Pair all this with the massive 32GB RAM, and you’ve got yourself a machine that can support all your multitasking needs. You will be able to use a bunch of programs at the same time, jump through a ton of tabs across multiple browsers, take conference calls, stream while gaming, and more; all without a hint of lag.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in 1TB SSD to help you store all your important data, from work documents, to media content, research papers, and even a few games, in a single place. SSDs are also much faster than their traditional counterparts, so you’ll enjoy better boot and transfer times just as well. Note that the memory and the storage capacities are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively. You can easily upgrade the system as your needs grow. Those who prefer working with a multi monitor setup will appreciate how the mini PC supports three-screen 4k displays with its HDMI, DP 1.4, and USB4 ports. The USB4 port delivers up to 40Gbps transfer speed, as well, plus provides 15W of power delivery to charge smaller devices or accessories. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, 2.5GbE LAN, and a range of additional ports to create a full-fledged productive setup.</p>
<p>But despite all the power, the PC keeps things quite calm and cool as it works. That’s thanks to an upgraded silent centrifugal fan, dual copper heat pipes, and a dual-fin module. The all-copper structure improves the overall thermal conductivity and increases airflow by 35%. Translation? Exceptional performance even when you’re juggling heavy creative workloads on a busy day.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab a power mini PC that offers strong performance but doesn’t break the bank, the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini gaming PC is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5960/">Don’t forget to use the discounted code <strong><em>JEG1HLJI7VJK</em></strong> at checkout to maximize your savings!</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fifa-new-game-netflix-2026-world-cup-delphi-interactive-2000654568</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>FIFA </em>is coming back as a Netflix exclusive. I mean, not really <em>FIFA</em> per se. That franchise is now called <em>EA Sports FC</em> after soccer’s international governing body failed to get EA to keep paying for the licensing rights. This new<em> FIFA</em>, which will only be playable on the Netflix app, will likely be something very different. FIFA and Netflix promise it’s coming next year in time for the 2026 World Cup, but as of right now it’s not even really clear who’s actually going to develop this new soccer game.</p> <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix">Yesterday’s press release</a> points to Delphi Interactive as the publisher and developer. It’s only real credit up to this point is getting the licensing rights to James Bond for IO Interactive’s upcoming <em>007 First Light</em> game. The Beverly Hills-based outfit bills itself as building “AAA games based on the most desirable IP franchises in the world,” but only has 14 people associated with the company on LinkedIn.</p>

 <p>One of those is CEO <span><span dir="ltr"></span></span></p>

 <p>So who at Delphi actually knows about games? Well, the company did hire <a href="https://www.nordiskgames.com/">Nordisk Games</a> founder Mikkel Weider, who Daugaard previously lauded for having “essentially blitz-scaled Nordisk Games from one employee to 1,300 in just a few years.” Is that what’s going on here? An army of hundreds of developers and outsource teams, working for years in complete secrecy on what FIFA hopes will be the most popular sim soccer game in the world?</p>

 <p>From the outside at least, Delphi Interactive appears to be a financial instrument for hashing out deals. What does it mean to be an AAA publisher with no obvious development experience?&nbsp;“In the era of digital game distribution, we believe that if you have access to a beloved global intellectual property, and you have access to capital to develop and market games, and you have access to the best independent development talent, you can actually make a successful AAA game outside of what we now lovingly refer to as the ’publisher industrial complex’ that has sort of traditionally oligopolized the AAA space,” Daugaard <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/delphi-interactive-nordisk-games-mikkel-weider-strictly-business-1236192058/">told <em>Variety</em></a> last year. So there’s that, I guess?</p>

 <p>One possibility is that Netflix, FIFA, and Delphi Interactive will outsource most of the actual making of this new game to studios abroad, likely in cheaper labor markets where armies of developers can brute-force something into existence in record time. Or maybe the plan is to take a soccer sim that’s already in existence and reskin it with FIFA logos and the likenesses of international stars. “Stay tuned for more details soon,” Daugaard wrote this week.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t help instill confidence that the other two groups involved don’t have great track records. After throwing itself into gaming, including trying to make its own internal blockbuster studio with seasoned industry talent, Netflix has retreated into simple party games and branded cash-ins of its popular streaming franchises. FIFA, meanwhile, remains one of the grimiest international operators out there. It recently invented a fake peace prize to appease President Donald Trump ahead of the World Cup. It’ll be much harder to fake an alternative to <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p> <p>Delphi Interactive and FIFA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Since the terms haven't been disclosed, we don't know what Sony and Tencent have agreed upon with regards to <em>Light of Motiram</em>, but we do know that the game is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/info/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">no longer listed</a> on Steam, which could point to an extensive rebrand being on the cards for the near future.</p><p>If you need a refresher, <em>Light of Motiram </em>was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de12962d-e208-46b1-aeaf-7d9dfc338831" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>, quickly attracting attention for its art style's similarities to Sony and Guerrilla Games' <em>Horizon </em>series.</p><p>These similarities were clearly subsequently brought to the attention of Sony itself, because the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="158b5a17-6308-4b2e-9131-b6559d6e961f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">filed a lawsuit</a> against Tencent in July, calling <em>Light of Motiram </em>a "slavish clone" of <em>Horizon </em>and alleging copyright infringement.</p><p>Although the Steam page for <em>Light of Motiram </em>has been killed, it's entirely possible Tencent will revive the project under a different name, although doing so will probably also require an extensive rework of the aesthetic (and potentially even the underlying gameplay mechanics).</p><figure role="group">

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> is one of the few Silent Hill games set outside Silent Hill itself. It transports players from the eternal doldrums of Maine, North America to 1960s Japan, and casts you as a school student in the foggy village of Ebisugaoka. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">very good</a>, thanks not least to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-writer-ryukishi07-shares-what-he-hopes-you-learn-from-his-take-on-the-horror-series">a thoughtful and poignant story from Ryukishi07</a>. Appetites are now whetted for a Silent Hill package tour, and Konami producer Motoi Okamoto already has a few ideas about where he'd like the series to go next. Ideas that, admittedly, make me nervous about the possibility of ham-fisted cultural misrepresentation.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe," Okamoto <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-interview-okamoto-konami-americas">told Inverse's Shannon Liao</a> in a recent, translated interview. "For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further." 
</p>
<p>
Asked to elaborate, Okamoto commented that he reads horror books from Central and South America. He also referenced magical realism, a literary tradition in which myths and folklore form part of daily life, which has precedents across the globe, but is heavily associated (in my experience, anyway) with 20th century Central and South American authors including Gabriel García Márquez and Mariana Enríquez. I can't quite tell from the write-up, but it sounds like Okamoto cited these last two authors in particular. 
</p>
<p>
He also made more general - indeed, broad to the point of demeaning and reductive - reference to political events that could make a useful context for a Silent Hill game. "Those areas have been affected by a lot of military governments and coups," Okamoto told Liao. "There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There's also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs." As for the above mention of Korea, Russia and Italy, Okamoto didn't go into detail. In his defence, he was answering questions in person and, I imagine, trying to avoid getting too specific, for fear of setting tongues a-wagging. 
</p><p>
Okamoto feels one obstacle to setting a Silent Hill game in Central or South America is the absence of a local developer they would trust with the keys to this horror series. "Central and South America do not have very many prominent development studios for video games capable of handling an IP like Silent Hill," he said. "So while they have a lot of interesting movies, books, and tales, how we would translate that into games is something we still have to explore."
</p>
<p>
Anglophone writers in the northern hemisphere have often done a terrible job of covering the game development scene in Central and South America. Well, <em>I</em> have at least. But one group who come to mind are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ace-team">Ace Team</a>, the creators of Zeno Clash, Rock Of Ages, and The Eternal Cylinder. I think they might find Silent Hill a bit sedate visually, but they've certainly got an eye for unearthly creatures and places. There's also Dual Effect, creators of Tormented Souls, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-i-want-for-spook-month-is-more-classic-survival-horror">in the right ballpark</a>, but closer to Resi and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outlast">Outlast</a> than Silent Hill.
</p>
<p>
In the shorter term, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. It's being developed in Scotland by Screen Burn (formerly No Code), developers of Observation and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a>. I have no idea where it's set, but given the studio's past projects, it should have some frightful gadgets in it.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-goes-rogue-on-amazon-this-laptop-i5-512gb-ddr5-wifi-6-drops-nearly-80-off-2000654514</link>
            <guid>1387036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Shopping for a laptop usually means choosing between your budget and your wish list, but sometimes the universe throws you a bone: This Lenovo <em>IdeaPad Slim 3</em> laptop (512GB, Intel i5, (8GB DDR5 RAM) just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/">dropped to $439 on Amazon, slashing over three-quarters off its $1,999 list price</a> in what’s an all-time low. Lenovo’s own website isn’t even close to matching this deal, which tells you everything about Amazon’s year-end clearance desperation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6482/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>This Year-End Surprise Brings Together Power and Portability</h2>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop has an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-13420H processor inside and this octa-core chip lets you do a lot of things at once. This processor has a hybrid architecture with four performance cores that can run at speeds of up to 4.6GHz and four efficiency cores that can run at speeds of up to 3.4GHz which means it can do anything from streaming video to working on spreadsheets without any problems. The 12MB cache lets the system handle multiple browser tabs, documents, and applications at the same time which makes it great for students who have to write research papers or professionals who have to manage several projects at once.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch screen has a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200 pixels, which gives you a little more vertical space than regular Full HD screens which is useful when you’re scrolling through long documents or web pages. With 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare coating, the IPS panel lets you work comfortably in a wide range of lighting conditions, from dark rooms to bright coffee shops. The 60Hz refresh rate works fine for everyday computing tasks, and the narrow bezels make the laptop feel more modern than its price would suggest.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD provides a lot of space for documents, photos, and apps, and it also boots up quickly and lets you access files quickly. With this solid-state drive, you won’t have to wait for programs to start or files to save like you would with older laptops that had regular hard drives. If you ever need more storage space, the M.2 form factor makes it easy to upgrade in the future. This laptop has also <strong>two USB-A ports, one USB-C port with Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 support, an HDMI 1.4 output, a headphone jack, and an SD card reader</strong>: This means it can connect to just about any device you might need it to.</p>
<p>This laptop is a great deal at $439, especially since you’re getting hardware that costs less than a quarter of what it was originally asking for. That $1,560 discount turns what would be a mid-range purchase into an amazing deal, especially for people who need a good Windows computer but don’t want to spend a lot of money.</p>

<p>This guide will give you all the relevant details regarding the Roblox Universal Tower Defense Season 1 battlepass, letting you decide if the premium pass is actually worth </p>



<p>Universal Tower Defense debuted with Update 0, which introduced new Units, Items, maps, and the Season 1 Battlepass. Like most <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> games, the UTD Battlepass comes in two versions: Premium Plan and Free Plan. The former, as you guessed, costs <strong>799 Robux</strong>, while the latter is for those who prefer not to spend any. The Free Plan offers the same kind of rewards as its counterpart, but in smaller quantities. Additionally, the Battlepass includes Tier Skips and a bundle, all of which also require Robux. This article breaks down all the Season 1 Battlepass rewards in Universal Tower Defense, along with their descriptions and pricing details.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Pet Capture Adventure monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gold Coins and much more.</p>



<p>Pet Capture Adventure is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience built around exploration, combat, and building a powerful collection of creatures. Players travel through different zones to catch pets with varying strengths, rarities, and abilities, then train them to perform better in battles. The long-term goal is to obtain rare pets, improve their stats through upgrades, and progress through increasingly challenging areas and bosses.</p>







<p>The game’s progression revolves around its primary currency, Gold Coins, which players earn by defeating wild pets, completing quests, and winning gym battles. These coins are essential for purchasing capture devices, training equipment, and special items that enhance your pets’ abilities. While Gold Coins can be earned through regular gameplay, the most efficient way to accelerate your adventure is by redeeming promo codes. Developers periodically release codes that grant free currency and bonuses, helping players strengthen their teams without excessive grinding.</p>

<p>Like most Roblox games, redeeming codes in Pet Capture Adventure is easy and rather simple. That being said, here are the steps for new players:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Pet Capture Adventure on Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the Store icon on the left side of the screen</li>



<li>Then click on the Codes option in the Store</li>



<li>Enter the code in the empty box given</li>



<li>Click on Redeem to claim the free rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-pet-capture-adventure-codes">How To Get More Pet Capture Adventure Codes</h2>



<p>Pet Capture Adventure codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server, the Roblox game page, and the creators’ social accounts where they post updates and announcements. That includes the Sleeping Dogs Club by BaofuBaoshou2, who is the creator, where they post codes occasionally.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around updates, new features, or special events, but if you’re only checking sporadically you’ll very easily miss them because there’s no alert system that tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working.</p>



<p>Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself. This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO has revealed that Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025, firing shots at Apple for obstructing its release. </p>



<p>Epic Games has been fighting hard to bring Fortnite back to iOS devices worldwide, but has faced major roadblocks from Apple. After releasing Fortnite in the EU, Apple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/judge-orders-apple-to-explain-why-fortnite-still-isnt-on-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked the game</a> on iOS, preventing its release in the US. Now, it seems a similar situation has occurred in Japan. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-will-not-return-to-ios-in-japan-in-2025">Fortnite Will Not Return to iOS in Japan in 2025</h2>



<p>A new post by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494517996732598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals that Fortnite’s return to iOS in Japan has been blocked. The post reveals that Apple was supposed to “open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.” The CEO proceeded to present more facts in the thread. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised. Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people… <a href="https://t.co/7hu5eGMQX6">pic.twitter.com/7hu5eGMQX6</a></p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494517996732598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sweeney revealed that Apple is charging “a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web.” Explaining that this practice has been “found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost, and the 9th Circuit Court upheld.” Additionally, Sweeney stated that Apple is presenting users with “new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors.”</p>



<p>The Epic Games CEO added that Apple is “imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API.” He has also stated that they will be raising their complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission. </p>







<p>In other news, Fortnite has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-2-5m-reload-elite-series-with-finals-at-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.5 million Reload Elite Series finals</a> at the Esports World Cup.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it's true — Microsoft is bringing two of its hottest gaming franchises together for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout</u></a> Season 2 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a> crossover event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering how, exactly, that may work, the official Call of Duty X/Twitter account has shared a brief video teaser which shows silhouettes of Fallout TV series characters The Ghoul, Lucy, and Maximus in the smoke of war, with bullets whizzing by in the background.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Okie dokie — stay focused, stay alive," the text on the post reads. "[Fallout TV show] is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Okie dokie - stay focused, stay alive ☢️<a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FalloutonPrime</a> is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded 💥 <a href="https://t.co/uyFl3mRDkG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/uyFl3mRDkG</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The implication here certainly seems to be that Call of Duty fans will see skins of those characters, which may or may not be tied to a premium event pass. Without further details — let alone a release date — it's hard to say for sure, though. We'll keep you posted, as always. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an opportune time to unite these two blockbuster games, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-now-extremely-likely-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-as-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us"><u>Battlefield 6 now looks "extremely likely" to beat Black Ops 7</u></a> to be crowned 2025's best-selling game, with the latter seemingly not only struggling against Battlefield's sales, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shipping-a-major-franchise-like-clockwork-every-year-is-a-really-difficult-task-microsoft-responds-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-disappointing-launch"><u>also that of its predecessor, Black Ops 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout, however, has never been more popular, and its highly anticipated second season premiered on Amazon Prime yesterday (December 17). The new Fallout season picks up in the aftermath of Season 1’s finale and travels through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas. Fans of Obsidian's much-loved video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say"><u>will be interested to hear that Season 2 takes a "fog of war" approach </u></a>(which sure does match the video we see above) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say"><u>to how it juggles Fallout: New Vegas' various endings</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-review"><u>opening episode of Season 2 a Good 7/10</u></a> but if you've yet to watch the first season, don't forget that Bethesda and Xbox recently teamed up with Amazon and Samsung so fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-prime-videos-fallout-season-1-for-free-from-today-on-samsung-tv-plus"><u>watching via Samsung TV Plus can stream Fallout Season 1 for free</u></a>. This means Season 1 is available subscription-free on Samsung TV Plus from now through to December 25. Samsung TV Plus is a free, ad-supported streaming service available on Samsung TV, Galaxy, Smart Monitor, and Family Hubs devices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind Amazon's hit show are gearing up to film Season 3 "next summer," with the hope that there <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer"><u>won't be a huge gap between the end of Season 2 and what's next</u></a>.

Sony's argument outlined numerous similarities and compared various marketing screenshots from both games, as well as their descriptions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like Horizon, Light of Motiram takes place in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by giant robot dinosaurs who roam large, natural environments such as tropical forests, deserts, and snowy mountains. Both games even feature red-haired women protagonists that wear very similar outfits and styles, and devices similar to Aloy's "Focus" earpiece.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Sony formally accused Tencent of developing a "knock-off game" and asked the court for a preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram to stop the Chinese megacorp from commencing pre-release promotion of its upcoming version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-suing-tencent-over-shameless-horizon-knock-off-game-light-of-motiram"><u>days after Sony filed its lawsuit</u></a>, Tencent quietly updated its Light of Motiram Steam page and swapped out a number of screenshots, including its cover image, before responding to Sony's lawsuit by claiming it was only making use of "well-trodden" tropes and suggesting the PlayStation maker's own game was too similar to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Indeed, Tencent hit back by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-copycat-drama-continues-as-tencent-claims-sony-was-already-concerned-its-game-too-closely-resembled-enslaved"><u>describing Sony's lawsuit as an overreach</u></a>, highlighting other game franchises with similar elements such as The Legend of Zelda and Far Cry. It was "startling," Tencent said, that Sony was now attempting to claim Horizon's concept was original, rather than an idea based on "ubiquitous genre ingredients."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bitter battle now seems to have come to an end, however. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a>, new <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>court papers</u></a> filed yesterday, December 17, show both parties have reached a "confidential settlement" that appears to have ended Sony's lawsuit, and Tencent's counter-suit, too. All parties are reportedly responsible for their own fees and costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without publicly sharing the terms of the deal, it's not possible to know how it all ended, although the disappearance of Light of Motiram is a fairly significant clue. The original URLs to both storefronts now redirect to each site's respective landing pages, and there's been no formal update from Tencent on the game's date. It seems unlikely we'll see it again, and almost certainly not in its present form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
