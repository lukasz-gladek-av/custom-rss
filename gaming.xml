		<p>TT Games and Warner Bros. have revealed their next big LEGO game – LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC!</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the definitive, essential Batman story, going from origin to legend. Train with the League of Shadows, fight crime in Gotham, face off against the Joker, Penguin, Bane (voiced by Matt Berry!) and plenty more, referencing TV, comics, movies and games, all mushed together in the TT Games way. This latest Lego game looks to build on the legacy of both the previous Lego Batman games and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The combat features powerful attacks, counters, combos in more of an Arkham Asylum way.&nbsp;This game will have difficulty levels for the first time – Dark Knight mode will ramp things up – and you will build a family of Bat-allies.</p>
<p>Oh, and Gotham is a big open world as well to explore how you see fit.</p>

<p>Looking back at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, we said “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious Lego game yet, and despite the occasional technical mishap it delivers a daring and often delightful romp through the most iconic film franchise of all time.”</p>

		<p>Long-awaited sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/routine">Routine</a> now has a launch window, and is set to launch in late 2025 for Xbox and Steam, and it will be day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROUTINE | Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hH5ZYM3nCP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Routine is a first person sci-fi horror game set on an abandoned lunar base featuring plenty of retro analogue technology as you go face to face with a terrifying threat.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of bullet pointed blurb from Lunar Software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigate a retro-analogue future</strong> – Roam through contrasting sectors of the Lunar station, from abandoned malls to deteriorating living quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive design and gameplay </strong>– Full body awareness, diegetic audio, and a minimal UI create a gripping and atmospheric experience.</li>
<li><strong>Explore using tools</strong> – The Cosmonaut Assistance Tool (C.A.T.) is vital, and players must use it to access critical terminals, navigate the environment and identify clues.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the unknown </strong>– Run, hide, or attempt to defend against threats, using the C.A.T. as a last resort.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its first announcement in 2013, Lunar Software has been beavering away for over a decade to flesh out an immersive world to scare the heck out of you. Before a brief check in back in July, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/09/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-re-revealed-with-a-creepy-new-trailer/">the previous update we had for the game was way back in 2022</a>, where a re-reveal trailer featured during Summer Game Fest.</p>

<p>It could actually be good, then!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced a brand-new <strong>Bubsy</strong> game – no, really!</p>
<p>In collaboration with developer Fabraz, known for the rather excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> will launch on the Switch and Switch 2. And it actually looks pretty good too! There's no release date at the time of writing, but more information will be coming very soon.</p>
<p>There's even a special outfit available in-game that lets you recreate the old Bubsy games – y'know, if you want. Man, it looks so cool.</p>
<p>Let's check out the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, the Woolies - an aggressive, fabric-stealing alien race from the planet Rayon - are back at it again but this time going straight for the source: stealing Earth's sheep and empowering them with Woolie technology. Things quickly spiral when the sheep revolt, creating a new breed of enemies, the BaaBots, to overthrow their captors and return with a new army to claim back The Golden Fleeces. Now, it’s up to Bubsy and his motley crew of acquaintances to journey through space and steal back the Golden Fleece from the BaaBot’s newly claimed, fleece powered, woolly home planets."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also releasing a collection of Bubsy games in collaboration with Limited Run Games. This will be launching on 9th September 2025, so could well prove to be the best way to prepare for Bubsy 4D.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-is-the-%E2%80%9Cdefinitive%E2%80%9D-batman-experience-coming-in-2026.1274373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Traveler's Tales (also known as TT Games) has announced its latest major LEGO game, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, during Gamescom ONL 2025, which it says is the "<em>definitive</em>" Batman story and experience that will take players through every major aspect of Bruce Wayne's story.</p>



<p>Similar to how <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-biggest-lego-launch-sales/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> took players through every era of Star Wars in LEGO form, <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will let players explore bits of every era of Batman in an open world Gotham spanning the decades of films, TV shows, games, and comics. You'll even be able to fight crime across Gotham in any version of the Batmobile that you might prefer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>No specific release date was announced for Legacy of the Dark Knight, but we do have a 2026 release window for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. There's also no mention of a Nintendo Switch version, making this another new Switch 2 exclusive title for Nintendo players.</p>



<p>One element that seems to be a key difference for Legacy of the Dark Knight compared to previous LEGO games, is that only seven playable characters are confirmed so far. Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul are the confirmed characters so far, which could mean that this is the first licensed LEGO game that doesn't let you collect and swap between characters, big and small, from a franchise.</p>



<p>That's just speculation, however, based on the game's <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">FAQ</a>, as we could get further clarification sometime in the future. But it could also very well be the case, as the FAQ also stipulates that Legacy of the Dark Knight will pull together "<em>iconic moments from the Caped Crusader’s 86-year history in film, television, comic books, and games,</em>" but doesn't specify that we'll play through any of those specific stories the way you play through each of the films in the Skywalker Saga.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's still an exciting announcement for LEGO and Batman fans alike, and could potentially be one of the best reveals throughout the entire Gamescom ONL 2025 showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, CI Games shared the first cinematic trailer for Lords of the Fallen II. The sequel to the 2023 Soulslike game is still planned to launch at some point in 2026 for PC (only on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/deathbringer-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9p2wwhwd5v4v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>. Wishlisting is now available on all those platforms. </p>



<p>Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>After selling over 2 million units and welcoming over 5.5 million Lampbearers into Lords of the Fallen, it’s clear our comeback was community-powered. With Lords of the Fallen II, we’re going further. In 2024 we proudly announced our deep commitment to be a player-first studio. The V2.0 update was our promise in action: listen, respond, and deliver. This sequel is built on that same foundation.</em></p>



<p>The Polish publisher has also shared the initial rundown of Lords of the Fallen II features, though admittedly it looks a lot like that of the previous installment, with the exception of the community feedback mention.</p>



<p><em><strong>DUAL WORLDS:<br></strong>● Explore two fully explorable parallel realms, including a deadlier, expanded Umbral.<br><strong>FULL CO-OP PROGRESSION:<br></strong>● Full shared campaign progression in online co-op from day one.<br><strong>PLAYER-FIRST DESIGN:<br></strong>● Developed in direct response to community feedback, including optional PvP and custom game modifiers.<br><strong>VISCERAL COMBAT:<br></strong>● Brutal executions, extreme gore, and an unapologetically mature-rated experience.<br><strong>UNREAL ENGINE 5:<br></strong>● Lords of the Fallen’s signature visual style and tight gameplay upgraded for the next generation.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>There must be a lot more to it if CI Games really hopes to make the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as significant for the franchise as The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars</a>. Anyway, to celebrate the announcement, the Lords of the Fallen II team will be live at Gamescom 2025 with its official Tattoo Sanctum, offering attendees a ‘soulslike for the flesh’: free tattoos (permanent and henna) inspired by exclusive new imagery from the franchise. For those unable to attend, a sweepstakes will offer a one-of-a-kind canvas painted by Maxime Taccardi of The Scion, painted in the artist’s own blood - a visceral tribute to the unapologetic gore awaiting players in Lords of the Fallen II.</p>



<p>While the game itself isn't playable at this year's event, we will have the chance to speak with one of the CI Games executives about it. Stay tuned for our interview.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Reveal Analysis]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-reveal-analysis/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision and Treyarch recently invited a select group of journalists and content creators out to their California-based offices to get an early sneak peek at the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. While we did get to go hands-on with the multiplayer, that’s something that Activision has requested that we keep under wraps for the time being.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes at a strange time in the series for those that have been following the likes of Mason and Menendez over the fifteen years that the Black Ops series has run. Thematically, it looks like a direct continuation of last year’s Black Ops 6, while narratively, it’s actually a sequel to Black Ops 2. As a quick refresher, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 took place across a couple of different timelines, both in the mid to late-80’s as well as the current year of 2025. Black Ops 7 takes those threads planted and brings the story up ten years in the future to the year 2035. Treyarch assured that there wouldn’t be any homework required to get into the narrative of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and rather exists as a narrative throughline for longtime fans of the Call of Duty campaigns to appreciate.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, Treyarch has revealed that they want Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to be a social and connected experience and started off by showing some sneak peek at what they’re working on for a co-op campaign. From start to finish, the entire campaign can be played either solo or co-op with up to four players. During an interview with one of the lead developers, it was confirmed that there would not be any difficulty options this time around; rather, the difficulty would be dictated by the number of players in a given match. There also aren’t any intentions to fill a solo campaign with AI bots and at this stage of development, drop-in and drop-out matchmaking isn’t yet in the cards.</p>



<p>The campaign itself brings together a ragtag team of some of the best of the best in their respective units, with John Eric Bently and Michael Rooker reprising their roles from Black Ops 2 while David Mason is now portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia of Gilmore Girls fame. Leilani “50/50” Tupuola is the resident newcomer of the team, being portrayed by Frankie Adams and representing New Zealand for the first time in the series. This newcomer has a number of bionic augmentations making her a unique member of the squad.</p>


<figure>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Sharing a few more details on the campaign, Treyarch is talking about how this would be a “mind-bending narrative” connecting Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 7. These include a variety of diverse missions including a number centered around squad leader Mason’s fractured psyche. One of the brief campaign snippets centered around a twisted version of Menendez’s Nicaraguan safehouse with a massive version of Menendez looming overhead while massive machetes rain down on the battlefield.</p>



<p>Once the campaign is complete, players graduate and unlock a new twelfth mission called Endgame. This massive campaign mission unlocks all of Avalon for players to explore with support for up to 32 players in a single match. Using the campaign as a sort of tutorial, Endgame builds upon everything that players learned and utilized, from the new tools and movement to weapon loadouts, to create a tiered, shared experience. Think MWZ’s missions and difficulty tiers but with more permanent progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To empower players during their “power journey”, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Endgame lets players pick a single Operator and level up to customize their skills and abilities far beyond anything in the actual campaign. Regrettably, a full squad wipe will reset progress for that given Operator. Treyarch only showed slides of what the progression/status screens look like but from what I could tell, the given Operator was called Striker and had two active abilities to equip. A separate Combat Efficiency stat (this operator was rated at 60). There were three different power upgrades showing health, armor and foot (presumably a mobility stat) that each had three different ranks.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Weapons themselves appeared to have different rarity tiers as well as levels. One of the two weapons equipped was an Exotic tier weapon with a unique ability: all ammo collected into one massive clip. Whether this means that it’s an actual unique weapon in itself, or simply pulling from a list of special weapon perks, is something that I’m waiting to see Treyarch reeal when they get ready to talk more about Endgame.</p>



<p>Lastly, Treyarch ended their talk about the connected campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. For the first time in franchise history, there will be global progression regardless of players going through the campaign, multiplayer, zombies, wargame, et cetera. There will be a dedicated camo track for the co-op campaign as well as the first mastery camos. To keep players want to come back into the campaign (beyond just the Endgame), there will also be seasonal events including daily challenges and reticle changes. Weekly challenges won’t be in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at launch but are intended to drop alongside the first season.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch on November 14th.</p>

<p>The game's set in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> and stars veteran Black Opser David Mason. It's delivering a bit of futuristic and psychological weirdness alongside the usual war. There's a campaign that you can tackle solo or with up to four-players via co-op. This campaign also has an endgame called Endgame, which is definitely peak videogames.</p>
<p>It's set in 2035, with the likes of Raul Menendez and Emma Kagan, CEO of a tech company dubbed The Guild, looking like they're the baddies. Aside from that, it's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>.</p>
<p>There's an an open beta starting on 2nd October with early access for those who pre-order or subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console. We'll hear more about Black Ops 7's multiplayer bits at a Call of Duty Next showcase on September 30.</p>

              <p>The next&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman&nbsp;</em>game was announced today at Gamescom One Night Live, and surprisingly, it looks like the <em>Arkham&nbsp;</em>game that we’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> is coming in 2026 and includes several references to different iterations of Bruce Wayne’s story. The action combat, open-world exploration through Gotham City, and even the explosive gel Batman uses to blow through obstacles are evocative of the <em>Arkham&nbsp;</em>games, but there are also references to numerous other takes on Batman, including Christopher Nolan’s <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy.</p> <p>Lead developer Jonathan Smith described it on stage as the “definitive, essential Batman story,” one which will cover the character’s life from his origin to becoming the hero of Gotham. Though some references to Nolan’s films, the Tim Burton movies, and even nods to Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em>&nbsp;were readily apparent in the trailer, Smith said <em>Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> will draw not just from movies but sources far and wide including TV shows, comics, and video games. As you go through Batman’s life, you’ll recruit the members of the Bat Family and face villains like the Joker, Penguin, and Bane, the last of whom will be voiced by Matt Berry. Check out the trailer below:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Legacy of the Dark Knight&nbsp;</em>is the first&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman&nbsp;</em>since 2014’s&nbsp;<em>Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham</em>, though there was a&nbsp;<em>Lego DC Villains&nbsp;</em>game in 2018 that featured the Caped Crusader. Since then, the Lego games have jumped around from <em>Star Wars </em>to Marvel and even included, weirdly enough, a <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em> game last year. <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761">It was fine</a>! The <em>Lego&nbsp;</em>games are usually fairly straightforward beat-em-up platformers, so <em>Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> does seem pretty robust for the franchise. <em>Arkham </em>fans will probably be glad to see a lot of Rocksteady’s touchstones returning, as it’s been a whole decade since <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-the-kotaku-review-1712988273"><em>Arkham Knight</em></a> launched in 2015. <i>Legacy of the Dark Knight </i>will launch next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Today during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, Xbox, Treyarch, Raven Software, and Activision revealed the first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> <em>7</em> at Geoff’s yearly video game showcase. And, folks, it’s a trippy, wild mess.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7,</em></a> which launches on November 14 on consoles and PC,&nbsp;is set in 2035 and builds off narrative “threads from <em>Black Ops 2</em> and <em>Black Ops 6</em>,<em>” </em>featuring characters like past baddie Raul Menendez and a new character, main protagonist David Mason, related to the Masons from the past games in the series. The game will be available on Game Pass on day one, as with past <em>CoDs</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the wild-looking trailer for the game’s campaign, which supports four-player co-op.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egA6Pj485eA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p>Here’s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s official game description straight from Activision’s official site:</p> <blockquote><p>The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare. David Mason leads an elite JSOC team on a covert mission to the sprawling Mediterranean city of Avalon. While there, they discover a sophisticated plot that won’t just plunge the world into chaos, it will pull them into their own haunting pasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the devs who were brought on stage to talk about the newest<em> Call of Duty</em>, this is a very “twisted” game set in a <span>“world of fear” where </span><span>“nothing is what it seems.” That seems apparent in <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s first trailer, which features all sorts of wild scenery and imagery, including giant swords, people, weird floating roads, and more. Perhaps it will be nice to have some buddies helping you through these linear missions via the game’s co-op mode. But don’t worry, lone wolves are free to play solo.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Here’s a full video released by Activision about <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s co-op features and what sounds like a rogue-like mode that will offer plenty of replayability.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Co-Op Campaign Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mojN1Xy5mZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Announced in June, Black Ops 7 will arrive on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on November 14.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War 4 has been revealed at Gamescom in an epic new trailer that shows off multiple factions from the 40K universe. </p>



<p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is no time for peace, but there is time for fun as Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War 4 has been revealed at Gamescom with a bombastic new trailer that sees Space Marines battling Necrons and much more. </p>



<p>Like the previous three games, Dawn of War 4 will be a real-time strategy game rather than a third-person shooter like Space Marine 2. Players control the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines, but will also be able to play as three other factions, including the Adeptus Mechanicus, Orks, and the Necrons. </p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-4-gamesom-trailer">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 Gamesom trailer</h2>



<p>You can check out the Gamescom trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElY_k7HeufI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Blood Raven chapter is decked out in red armor and is a very different chapter to the Ultramarines from Space Marine 2. The Marines will be joined by another faction, their allies, the Mechanicus. This army is also part of the Imperium of Mankind, but they’re a faction who believes that flesh is weak and gradually replaces their bodies with metallic parts. </p>



<p>They too, worship the God Emperor of Mankind, but they view him as an avatar of the Omnissiah, the one true god, and also the deity of machines and invention. The Orks are big green space brutes, and no Warhammer game would be complete without them joining in for a spot of Waaaaah!</p>



<p>Finally, the third faction will be the Necrons, ancient aliens who turned themselves into robots and now look to wrestle control of the galaxy from humanity – because they believe that only they can defeat enemies like the Tyranids and Chaos. </p>



<p>The game will feature a story campaign that gives every faction a chance to shine, but the game will also feature other modes such as skirmish matches, co-op play, and competitive multiplayer. It will also bring back the classic Last Stand mode, which is where players need to survive against hordes of enemies.</p>



<p>There’s no release date as of yet, and as far as we know, the game will only be coming to PC and won’t be receiving a console release.</p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has been revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live, and fans of the caped crusader are going to be thrilled about this one.</p>



<p>LEGO has recently been announcing a variety of new games. Most notably, they revealed LEGO Party, which is set to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-party-announced-for-september-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in September</a>&nbsp;and could compete with Mario Party. Additionally, a LEGO Voyagers game is expected to launch soon. Interestingly, the LEGO Batman game announced today confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-is-getting-the-skywalker-saga-treatment-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier leaks</a> that it will receive treatment similar to that of LEGO Star Wars: Skywalker Saga.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-will-feature-a-number-of-classic-characters">LEGO Batman will feature a number of classic characters</h2>



<p><strong>“LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is a brand-new open world action adventure videogame that invites players to embark on Bruce Wayne’s epic journey to become the hero of Gotham City, inspired by decades of Batman films, television, comic books, and games, and jam-packed with Batman nostalgia, DC lore, and TT Games’ signature brand of fun-filled LEGO humor,”</strong> the trailer’s description reads.</p>



<p>Check out the LEGO Batman trailer below. The game is set to launch in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The upcoming LEGO Batman game is being developed by TT Games, just like the Skywalker Saga and the previous Batman titles. The last LEGO Batman game released was “Batman 3: Beyond Gotham” in 2014. Unlike earlier games that drew inspiration from comic books, this new installment focuses exclusively on content from live-action films. Players will not only be able to meet and interact with the characters they saw in the movies, but also play as many of them.</p>

At the start of this month, the title received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-gets-permanent-price-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent price cut</a> (over 50% for consoles) across all platforms. Lords of the Fallen 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-revealed-during-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> soon after, and now we have the official reveal. </p>

There are more than 100 weapons to master, along with devastating magic abilities to take on a variety of enemies and bosses. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">For the first time in Call of Duty's history, we're getting back-to-back Black Ops titles, and whereas last year's Black Ops 6 was grounded in the '90s, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> aims to propel Call of Duty back to the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the far-future setting possibly hinted at in leaks, this is just the <em>near</em> future, as seen back in Black Ops 2. The game won't feature jet packs, wall-running, or anything too high-tech, but there are still plenty of gadgets, robots, and enhancements to Treyarch's omnimovement system to provide the futuristic aesthetics for Black Ops 7. The game will also launch with an ambitious new campaign and a massive round-based Zombies map.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently attended an early preview of Black Ops 7, where we received a huge info dump across all the game modes and previewed a few bits of the game. Despite being tasked with developing these back-to-back titles, Treyarch still managed to pack plenty of content into Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller explained that Black Ops 6 and 7 were planned out and developed together, and the ability to push out this much content at launch was a collaborative effort across multiple Call of Duty studios.</p><p dir="ltr">"We had two really clear and distinct visions for both games," Miller said. "We, early on, knew we wanted to do something different as far as the eras, and tie in the '90s game with the darker themes from Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2."</p><p dir="ltr">To keep things fresh for Black Ops 7, Treyarch leans into the time difference between the games. The story is set in the year 2035, which allows for enhanced soldiers and even more advanced omnimovement abilities, with players able to pull off wall jumps and perform combat rolls to avoid taking damage from a high fall. The scorestreaks of Black Ops 7 are also more high-tech and advanced than in Black Ops 6. One example we saw was the new D.A.W.G. scorestreak in action: a dog-like robot equipped with heavy guns and even a Trophy system for intercepting enemy projectiles.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also confirmed that Black Ops 7 will feature progression across all modes. This means players will not only level up and unlock rewards in multiplayer and Zombies, but also the campaign.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551108-bo7_mp_forge_reveal_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551108-bo7_mp_forge_reveal_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551108"></a><figcaption>D.A.W.G. scorestreak in multiplayer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551108-bo7_mp_forge_reveal_branded.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A futuristic campaign</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's campaign is a globetrotting affair with missions taking place in Los Angeles, Tokyo, and locations within Nicaragua. The narrative is themed around fear and perception, fighting against an enemy using a mind-altering weapon to stimulate fear and create hallucinations. This theme lets Treyarch lean into the whimsical and mind-bending style often featured in Black Ops games. In the snippet of the campaign we were shown, the characters were fighting in Nicaragua, but in true Black Ops fashion, there were giant machetes falling from the sky and floating chunks of land hovering all around the map like something out of a fantasy game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Black Ops 7 campaign is designed for up to four-player co-op, but it can be experienced solo as well. The developers confirmed the difficulty scales when playing co-op, meaning partying up with friends doesn't necessarily make it easier, and teamwork is needed to get through missions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New "endgame" campaign content</h2><p dir="ltr">The most notable detail about the campaign is the inclusion of an "endgame." Treyarch confirmed there are a total of 11 campaign missions, and there will be a conclusion to the story, but completion of the story unlocks a twelfth mission as endgame content designed with replayability in mind.</p><p dir="ltr">We were briefly shown a map of Avalon for this endgame content. Yes, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">once-rumored Warzone map</a> has turned into a campaign location, and the size definitely looks like it could be on par with a large Warzone map, or perhaps even bigger. Parts of Avalon are featured in the campaign missions, but players won't unlock the full map and content until reaching the endgame. This allows for open-world gameplay with up to 32 players dropping into matches that sound like they have elements of Modern Warfare 2's DMZ mode and Modern Warfare 3's Zombies mode mixed in. Players can customize their characters in the endgame with the skills and abilities featured in the campaign, such as grappling hooks and the cloaking ability of Active Camo.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch design director Kevin Drew described this endgame as a unique power journey that requires several sessions to complete. Players need to level up to upgrade their health, loadout, and abilities before reaching the harder regions of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">"You're going to be wingsuiting in, and there is a new conflict that has you finding that final objective in the hardest region of Avalon," Drew explained.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also risk involved here, as getting squad-wiped in a match means you lose all of your progression for the operator. In order to keep your rewards, you'll need to survive and exfiltrate from Avalon at the end of a session.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a lot more weight to everything you do in the endgame," Drew said. "You have to make sure you escape every time. If you die, you're going to lose that."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551109-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551109-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551109"></a><figcaption>Wingsuits on Avalon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551109-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Treyarch confirmed six of the 11 campaign missions are standard linear missions, and the other five are larger in scale and take place on parts of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the greatest detriments to MW3's poorly-received campaign was the handful of missions that dropped players into an open-world setting and had an empty, less-engaging feel than more directed, linear levels. These missions killed the pace of the campaign and lessened the impact of the more story-driven missions. With that in mind, I asked Miller how similar these larger Avalon missions were to those of MW3.</p><p dir="ltr">"Avalon is the full endgame experience," Miller said. "That is your open-world 'do anything'-type missions, but there are [campaign] missions in between that are specific areas of Avalon to ease you into that [endgame] experience, so when you hit the endgame, you have an idea of what's going on."</p><p dir="ltr">"Those missions are very directed, though," Miller continued. "They are linear missions that just so happen to take place on Avalon."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Multiplayer with new gadgets and tech</h2><p dir="ltr">As for multiplayer, Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps. There are 16 standard maps and two for the game's new large-scale Skirmish mode. The 18 include mostly brand-new locations for Black Ops 7, but three of the standard maps are popular picks from Black Ops 2--Raid, Hijacked, and Express all return, but they have a slightly different aesthetic as they are now set in Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Skirmish, Treyarch's ambitious new Ground War-style mode, features squads of four competing in 20v20 matches with a variety of capture-, destroy-, or escort-style objectives to complete. The larger map sizes used for Skirmish make use of the campaign's wingsuits, grappling hooks, and vehicles to help you better traverse the space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551125-bo7_reveal_cp_01branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551125" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551125-bo7_reveal_cp_01branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551125"></a><figcaption>The Guild robots</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551125-bo7_reveal_cp_01branded.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551118-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551119-bo7_reveal_cp_02branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551120-bo7_reveal_cp_03branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551121-bo7_reveal_cp_04branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551122-bo7_reveal_cp_06branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551123-bo7_reveal_cp_07branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551124-bo7_reveal_mp_homestead_01branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551118,1300-4551119,1300-4551120,1300-4551121,1300-4551122,1300-4551123,1300-4551124" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551118-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551119-bo7_reveal_cp_02branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551120-bo7_reveal_cp_03branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551121-bo7_reveal_cp_04branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551122-bo7_reveal_cp_06branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551123-bo7_reveal_cp_07branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4551124-bo7_reveal_mp_homestead_01branded.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551118-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551119-bo7_reveal_cp_02branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551120-bo7_reveal_cp_03branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551121-bo7_reveal_cp_04branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551122-bo7_reveal_cp_06branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551123-bo7_reveal_cp_07branded.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551124-bo7_reveal_mp_homestead_01branded.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One interesting feature we saw during our brief preview of Skirmish was something similar to Black Op 6's meat-shield mechanic, in which you can grab another player and use them as a shield. Instead of grabbing their opponent and holding them hostage, the operator attached an explosive to them and knocked them off a rooftop, leaving the opponent to glide down into the battle on their wingsuit and explode. It was very cinematic and cool-looking, although this feels like a new animation that will be very situational and difficult to pull off in a match.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch confirmed Black Ops 7 features 30 weapons at launch. While many of them are inspired by classics, 16 of the weapons are brand-new to Call of Duty. We were shown several guns, including the return of familiar Black Ops weapons like the Peacekeeper MK1 and M8A1 marksman rifle, but Treyarch also showed off new weapons like the Echo 12 shotgun. Scronce described the Echo 12 as a dual-burst shotgun with an underbarrel rotating magazine. We also saw a new sniper rifle called the DS Recon, which is inspired by the DSR 50 from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">One new change for multiplayer is the ability to "overclock" scorestreaks and equipment, allowing players to pick from one of two buffs that can be applied to make them even more efficient to use. One example was the Active Camo field upgrade, which is the digital camouflaging tech from Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare that allows the user to blend in with their surroundings. With the Overclocking feature, it can be buffed for a faster recharge speed for re-cloaking, or to allow for re-cloaking after the player fires their weapon. These Overclock options can help get the user back in the stealth mode a bit faster.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also confirmed a few perks for multiplayer. One notable inclusion is Looper, which lets players "loop" their scorestreaks to get more of them in a single life. By default, once you've used all three of your scorestreaks, you have to wait until you die and respawn to use them again, but Looper lets you keep using scorestreaks as long as you keep earning them.</p><p dir="ltr">Other perks include a Fast Hands-style perk to increase reload speed, which has been tied to attachments in recent years. The Tactical Sprint feature of previous games is also going to be turned off by default, but players who like the short burst of faster speed can equip Tactical Sprint as a perk. Additionally, the Wildcard and Combat Specialists perk bonuses from Black Ops 6 will return with Black Ops 7.</p><h2 dir="ltr">An ambitious round-based Zombies map</h2><p dir="ltr">As for Zombies, it will launch with the largest round-based map the mode has ever seen. It's inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit, but set entirely inside the Dark Aether. We were briefly shown an image of the map's overhead layout, which has a wobbly figure-eight shape to it. This odd design makes it more like a race track, as the map pieces together seven separate locations connected by dangerous stretches of road.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Tranzit, players can travel the roads between locations using a vehicle, but instead of the Tranzit bus system, there is a new Wonder Vehicle for players to use. Not a lot was discussed about this new ride, but Treyarch showed a brief image of an armored SUV-style vehicle with three demonic mouths coming out of the front grill, and the body of the vehicle wrapped in chains and monstrous-looking tendrils. Given the name "Wonder Vehicle," it's likely this is something similar to Wonder Weapons, where players must build it via hidden quest steps in order to progress with the map's storyline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551111-bo7_reveal_zm_02_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551111" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551111-bo7_reveal_zm_02_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551111"></a><figcaption>Iconic characters return</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551111-bo7_reveal_zm_02_branded.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of the seven map pieces, we were only shown the Farm location, which looked like a close recreation of Farm from the original Tranzit map. This is the only Zombies map available at launch, but Treyarch said more maps will arrive post-release, including some of the individual locations from the launch map. Miller confirmed some of the DLC maps will be new locations, but didn't say how many new maps would arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"There will be new round-based Zombies maps," Miller said. "There are a few of the specific [launch] map locations that will arrive as Survival maps in post-launch, but those don't take the place of new, full round-based experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Directed mode that helped guide players through Zombies' main story quests is also coming back for Black Ops 7. Scronce confirmed the studio saw more players completing the story Easter egg quests with Directed mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"There were so many players who didn't even know Zombies had a story," Scronce said. "It'll be back."</p><p dir="ltr">"Directed mode is one of those things we've been happy to see more people experiencing things, playing together, and seeing all the cool stuff that Zombies has to offer," Miller added.</p><p dir="ltr">Dead Ops Arcade, the Zombies twin-stick shooter mode, is also returning in Black Ops 7, but we didn't receive much information about it. A full Zombies reveal is scheduled for early September, and plenty of more Black Ops 7 details, including new information on Warzone, will be revealed during Call of Duty Next, which is taking place on September 30.</p><p dir="ltr">Going back-to-back with the same Call of Duty sub-series is a tall task. Experiencing Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 in consecutive years was an awkward approach, with MW3 feeling more like DLC than a standalone game. It didn't feel as fresh or exciting with so much of the content being recycled and the game staying grounded in the same era.</p><p dir="ltr">From what we were shown in this preview, Black Ops 7 has the potential to feel exciting, instead of like a Black Ops 6 expansion. The developer leaning into the drastic change in eras could do a lot for how Black Ops 7 feels. Of course, this is only based on what we saw previewed with Black Ops 7. As far as gameplay goes, our Black Ops 7 hands-on impressions will come at a later date.</p>

Treyarch has now confirmed that Black Ops 7 will feature progression across all modes. This means players can finally rank up and earn more meaningful rewards simply by playing through the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, Call of Duty campaigns were separate from the other modes, and players couldn't earn XP or many rewards from story missions. Black Ops 7 aims to make all modes feel rewarding, and the campaign is now tied into the same progression system.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551127-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551127" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551127-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551127"></a><figcaption>Wingsuits on Avalon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4551127-bo7_reveal_cp_05branded.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's worth noting that the progression doesn't happen from the beginning. Black Ops 7 features replayable endgame campaign content that unlocks after beating the game's 11 story missions. Players will earn XP to level up their rank and weapons by playing this endgame portion of the campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">This progression also counts toward the battle pass. When Call of Duty Season 1 launches with Black Ops 7's first battle pass, playing the endgame content will help you unlock those rewards, as if you were playing multiplayer or Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also revealed there is a dedicated camo track for the campaign this year. Just like the yearly mastery camo grind for multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone, the Black Ops 7 campaign will also have unique camos to unlock within the endgame. Campaign-based calling card challenges are also included as well.</p><p>In addition to campaign progression, Black Ops 7 will feature Call of Duty's Carry Forward program, but there are some changes to how and when the content transfers over.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We haven't heard from TT Games, developers of the Lego games, since their release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/embracing-the-light-and-dark-side">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> in 2022, but it turns out it's because they were hard at work building the next installment in their popular superhero series. Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was just announced at Gamescom's Opening Night Live.</p><p>While the Lego games were historically level-based journeys through a character's world, The Skywalker Saga broke that formula wide open with its release, creating a massive open world with character classes, improved vehicle controls, and new, original voice acting in addition to the dialogue from the films. Legacy of the Dark Knight seems to follow in that game's footsteps, featuring an open-world Gotham City and a bunch of references to past adaptations of the titular hero.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQAoGj01Rc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unlike other Lego games, which seem to either retell movie plots or create original stories, Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to split the difference, telling the story of Batman over the years with references to different chapters in his recent history. We see scenes from all three of Nolan's movies, a scene lifted straight from Matt Reeves' <em>The Batman</em>, and even references to the Arkham games, including what appears to be the series' explosive gel. These scenes are all re-voiced, however, to be more silly and fit the Lego style. When we see Bane from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, he's voiced by Matt Berry, rather than Tom Hardy.</p><p>The combat system has also been revamped to look more counter-based like the Arkham games, and the game will even include different difficulty levels – a first for the developer – for players who want a more challenging experience. While we only see the player playing as Batman in the revealed gameplay, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, and Batgirl are also confirmed to be playable.</p><p>The game comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026. If you want to learn more, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleyleblanc.bsky.social/post/3lwrjsmbfdk2s">our senior associate editor Wesley LeBlanc</a> is on the ground in Germany for a hands-on preview, which you can expect to hear more about later this week.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-announced-includes-content-from]]></content:encoded>

Treyarch is partnering with Raven Software to add a little bit more onto each one of those pillars for Black Ops 7 in particular.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9txkGBj_trg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For one, the campaign will ultimately culminate in a new additional mission dubbed "Endgame," which mixes elements of extraction shooters and roguelikes into a giant map you'll have to slowly pick apart and uncover. Multiplayer is also getting a new 20 vs. 20 mode dubbed "Skirmish," wall jumps included with the series' Omnimovement, and 16 maps, including three returning Black Ops 2 locales.</p><p>A glimpse of this will be available from October 2 through 8, when Activision will be hosting the Black Ops 7 beta. Early Access will go live for preorders and "eligible" Game Pass subscribers on October 2, while the Open Beta portion starts later on October 5.</p><p>For more, check out our early preview of what's new for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year, including a mind-bending, fear-gassed campaign and a massive new arsenal, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/18/days-of-future-past">right here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-arrives-on-november-14-beta-slated-for-october]]></content:encoded>
