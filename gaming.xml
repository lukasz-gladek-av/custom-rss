Danmaku battles faster than you’ve ever seen will unfold in the skies of Gensokyo as you use your mobility to dodge countless bullets flying at you with a variety of spells.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>A meteorite suddenly crashes into Gensokyo.</p><p>A crack appears on its metallic, egg-like surface, and small particles of light shine through the cracks, and they scatter all at once, in all directions.</p><p>Eventually, they reach the most powerful residents of Gensokyo.</p><p>One of these lights reaches Reimu Hakurei. It engulfs her, as it transforms into what looks like a suit of armor.</p><p>A name echoes in her head, and she repeats it out loud:</p><p>“Valkyrie Arms…”</p><p>Sensing the beginnings of an incident, she sighs and looks off in the direction which the light came from.</p><p>She floats up into the air, and is gone in the blink of an eye, leaving nothing but a red trail of light behind her.</p><p>“My body feels so light…”</p><p>Flying faster than ever before, Reimu realizes that her armor—her Valkyrie Arms—are to thank for her newfound speed.</p><p>Who gave her this power, and for what purpose? To find the reason behind it all, Reimu hurries on her way… but it doesn’t take long before someone stands in her way.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Standing before Reimu is another girl, similarly clad in a set of Valkyrie Arms. They were both granted the same power, and they both know what must be done…</p><p>And thus, a high-speed danmaku battle begins.</p><p><em>Valkyrie of Phantasm</em> is based on the <em>Touhou</em> series, but has a brand new original story with the creators’ own interpretations of the world and characters.

		<p>What, it’s Friday already? It’s always nice, if a little disorientating to have a bank holiday and a four day week and so rapidly find yourself back at the weekend, where you can chill out, get housework done, and all the rest. Of course, we’ve just been coming out of Easter, which will have given a little bit more time than usual for gaming.</p>
<p>For me, my little time sink has been Into The Breach, the fantastic mini turn-based tactical roguelike from, like, half a decade ago. I remember whiling away a whole Christmas playing it in 2018, and it’s just as good. I’ve also played some other bits and bobs, including the intriguing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/tron-catalyst-preview-glitchy-but-in-a-good-way/">Tron: Catalyst</a> from Mike Bithell and friends.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> gets things started this week by picking off more of the rogues gallery of villains within Assassin’s Creed Shadows, doing a little more cartography and generally progressing through to the game’s conclusion – “Even if the combat and story aren’t massively appealing, the stealth, exploration, and sheer level of beauty to the environments keep me coming back,” he says.</p>

<p>But then Oblivion Remastered released, and he’s suitably impressed. “The ‘remaster’ label may be confusing to some fans as the acclaimed RPG has received more than just a minor facelift. Whole swathes of the game have been improved and reworked while trying to retain that old school Oblivion feel.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the “fantastic” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/promise-mascot-agency-review/">Promise Mascot Agency</a> and the “very good” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy-review/">Amerzone: The Explorer’s Legacy</a> for their respective reviews, as well as more of The Witcher 3, which continues to be “a masterpiece”. He also saved Le Havre from relegation in FM24, while relying on youth players after selling loads of senior figures.</p>

<p><strong>Dom</strong> played a healthy smattering of games that included Hundred Line Defense Academy, Atelier Ryza, Star Overdrive and Unbeatable, and because of all of that has only managed around 20 minutes of Oblivion so far.</p>
<p>Needing something calm and relaxing, <strong>Steve</strong> played Crime Scene Cleaner on Game Pass – “Like an edgelord Powerwasher Simulator but there was something compulsive about putting furniture back in place and cleaning off bloodstains.” He then played the fun but repetitive Patrick Starfish game, and has continued on with his quest to 100% Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, where he’s now chasing blue bricks. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and the Oblivion remake are on his to-play list, but they’ll have to wait until the end of term….</p>

<p>Speaking of which, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been tasked with reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for us, and having a great time with it so far. While there’s great depths to the combat, the visuals and overarching story, his favourite aspect is its quirky sense of humour.</p>
<p>And <strong>Ade’s</strong> still carrying on with Atomfall and really enjoying it. “It’s a little rough around the edges, but I find it’s jankiness rather charming,” he says. “Plus, all the references and nods to Britsh Comics are a delight.”</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

With a unique story, distinct design, and one of the best gaming soundtracks to boot, Sandfall Interactive took inspiration from JRPGs—like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona</a> &amp; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy</a> —and adapted it into the western style whilst making their own stamp on the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently sitting at 92 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a>, plenty of reviewers across the gaming space have felt the same. What's even more impressive is that that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is actually Sandfall Interactive's first ever game—made up of just a small team of 30 to boot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is also available on Game Pass as a day-one launch. So, if you decide to try it out on the service or buy one of the deals ago so you can own it—you'll be supporting one of the best new studios in gaming and getting a Game of the Year contender-level experience in return, all at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, publisher Nacon and developer Teyon announced the launch date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-styx-and-cthulhu-announcements-headline-nacon-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>. The standalone expansion to the first-person shooter game will be available starting July 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Rogue City was the biggest launch registered by Nacon, making it more than understandable that they would want to build up on the successful release. Unfinished Business takes place after the events seen in the 2023 game, where the so-called New Guy in Town was defeated. The background is OCP's latest project, the OmniTower, a massive housing complex explicitly designed to meet the needs of the residents of Old Detroit. However, a group of highly trained mercenaries seizes the building, turning it into their deadly fortress. That's where RoboCop must step in to restore the rule of law.</p>
<p>The OmniTower is full of high-tech threats, such as flying drones, exploding bots, anti-personnel turrets, and deadly traps, on top of heavily armed elite troops that are equipped with mini-guns, jetpacks, and even katanas in some cases.</p>
<p>As RoboCop, players will be able to employ a vast arsenal, from the iconic Auto-9 to the brand-new Cryo Cannon. There are also devastating new finishing moves that highlight how he is the weapon himself when he picks up an enemy and smashes them into a concrete wall or a vending machine.</p>
<p>Moreover, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business will allow fans to step back into the past, when RoboCop was still police officer Alex Murphy, prior to the accident that left him near death. These unique missions will feature familiar faces and help flesh out the character even more, with the help of voice acting from the legendary Peter Weller.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ykC7btuV6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Unfinished Business will feature all the elements that made the base game successful: intense combat, thoughtful investigation, and light RPG elements. Nacon hasn't shared the pricing or the system requirements yet, but you can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right now</a>.</p>

            <p>Do subscribe to <a href="https://youtu.be/F707wIeTX2g">Tim Cain's YouTube channel</a> if you haven't already. The Fallout creator is eminently listenable and seems to have an infinite well of great stories about a career working on formative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s. His latest is on <a href="https://youtu.be/F707wIeTX2g">game preservation</a>, in which he reveals that Fallout developer and publisher Interplay had to approach him after he'd left the company to ask if he still had development archives they'd ordered him to destroy. The reason? "Oops! We lost it", Cain says (cheers, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">Games Radar</a>).</p>

<p>Cain gives three reasons why he thinks we've already lost a good chunk of the medium's history: either "no-one thought to keep it", people wanted to "keep their things private", or "there's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it."</p>
<p>"This has happened multiple times in my career. When I left Fallout, I was told 'You have to destroy everything you have.' and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code. Gone." (GURPS is Steve Jackson's 'Generic Universal RolePlaying System', which Fallout intended to use until a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_13:_A_GURPS_Post-Nuclear_Adventure#Termination_and_legal_issues">messy approval process</a> resulted in the creation of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system.)</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'Oops, we lost it', I thought they were trapping me into 'We're going to sue you if you say you have it," Cain says. "Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Among the casualties of Interplay's slapdash archiving were, says Cain, the GURPS code, possibly the original artwork and, perhaps most tragically, the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Talking_head">clay heads used to animate conversations</a>.</p>
<p>A fine example of never attributing to malice what you can to carelessness, this. "No one is against the idea of video game preservation, but companies and their shareholders are against the idea of not making a profit,” the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game History Foundation</a>'s Frank Cifaldi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">told me last year</a>. “It's a technical black hole; It costs a lot of money to port a video game, and if the margins are just not there, then there's not a business rationale to keep things alive.”</p>
<p>Still, there's seemingly been an uptick in companies making more of an effort recently, such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/playstation-is-using-a-cold-storage-vault-and-mineshafts-to-save-its-30-year-history">Playstation using mineshafts</a> to lovingly store old copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> in. This is good, because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-warren-spector-keeps-emailing-me-about-books">What's On Your Bookshelf </a>patron saint Warren Spector surely cannot rescue gaming history single-handedly, no matter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deus-ex-creator-warren-spector-has-literally-dumpster-dived-to-help-with-game-preservation">how much dumpster diving he does</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For eons, no contact existed between the two continents because ships couldn’t sail across the expanse. At last, when the historic first contact was made between the two powers, war erupted!</p><p>After long and costly fighting between the Fou Empire in the west and an alliance of countries in the east, both sides exhausted all their strength and resources. With no other alternative, the two powers agreed to an armistice.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>One year later, Princess Elena vanished. She had been traveling in the east from town to town, exploring battlegrounds and visiting war veterans. Her trail vanished in a small town near the front line. Nobody knew her whereabouts!</p><p>The Eastern Alliance wanted to avoid sending a large army to the front. Such a move would be a political blunder, breaking the armistice and stirring up hostilities. It became impossible to carry out a large-scale search for Elena. Time passed… with no sign of the princess.</p><p>Elena’s sister, Princess Nina, finally makes up her mind. She leaves on a journey in search of her sister—by herself.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ryu</strong> – Ryu meets Nina while he is lying unconscious on a street in a desert town in the eastern continent. His race and native land are unknown. Ryu has a Dragon’s Eye, which empowers him with the amazing abilities to transform into a dragon and summon dragons.</li><li><strong>Nina</strong> – The princess of Wyndia, a town of the Fae tribe (winged folk). Nina meets Ryu on her journey to seek her lost sister Elena. Though somewhat naïve, Nina is skilled in Healing magic.</li><li><strong>Scias</strong> – A mercenary soldier, Scias was hired by the eastern side during the war. Scias becomes the party’s watcher. He is very quiet and aloof from the world. Scias can perform a powerful double attack with his sword.</li><li><strong>Cray</strong> – A young leader of the Woren tribe (cat people) in the eastern alliance, Cray joins Nina to search for Princess Elena, his childhood friend. He has a strong sense of responsibility and acts as the leader of the party. His high offensive and defensive abilities are very dependable.</li><li><strong>Ershin</strong> – Ershin wears completely sealed armor to protect her from any kind of curse. Since she wears the armor all the time, no one knows her real face or background. She meets the party in a mysterious place polluted by a curse and decides to join them.</li><li><strong>Ursula</strong> – Ursula is a middle-class leader of the Fou Empire. She came to the eastern continent in search of dragons, and meets up with Ryu and his companions. Ursula was brought up in the military, and knows very little about worldly concerns.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has finally given an update on its plans to add an offline mode into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">first confirmed back in September 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
This decision was prompted by the acrimonious situation with Ubisoft's original The Crew game, which was shut down and nuked from orbit, removing all players' access and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-states-players-dont-have-unfettered-ownership-of-games-as-the-crew-lawsuit-continues">prompting a still-ongoing legal challenge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft has said that development is progressing "smoothly" on The Crew 2's offline option - which will ensure the game remains playable if and, let's face it, ultimately when Ubisoft does decide to pull the plug again.
</p>
<p>
The first user tests for The Crew 2's offline mode will begin next week, on 30th April, when a select group of fans will be invited to test the option on PC. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtX3oXj9yng&amp;ab_channel=Ubisoft">video message to fans</a>, producer Grégory Corgié confirmed the mode would roll out fully to all platforms at some point "before the end of 2025".
</p>
<p>
An offline mode for The Crew:  Motorfest, meanwhile, sounds further off - but is still coming.
</p>
<p>
"Regarding The Crew: Motorfest, our teams are currently focused on the live-service, and support for the game for years to come," Corgié said.
</p>
<p>
"But rest assured, The Crew: Motorfest will receive an offline mode. The Crew 2 will be first, allowing players to enjoy and switch between the online and offline mode whenever they want, when we will deploy the version before the end of 2025."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/privacy-firm-files-ubisoft-legal-complaint-over-data-collection-forced-online-in-single-player-games">privacy firm revealed it had launched a fresh lawsuit against Ubisoft over data collection and forced online in single-player games</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year, one group of modders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">set to work recreating the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a>, the Euphoria actress is set to star in the film adaptation of Josef Fares' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. She will also executive produce the upcoming film, which is being directed by Jon M Chu. Chu's previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it has not been decided whether Sweeney will play Mio or Zoe in the Split Fiction film.</p>
<p>It was first revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> earlier this year, when sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>But, it's not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>. However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>
<p>As for Split Fiction, the co-op caper shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM announced that the Resident Evil 4 Remake has broken the remarkable sales milestone of 10 million copies. The game initially launched in March 2023, so it's been a little over two years. Previous sales milestones included <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-surpass-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three million sold in the first two days</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four in just over a week</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five in less than four months</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-3-million-re4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six and a half by the end of 2023</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-over-7-million-units-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven million around its first anniversary</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-remake-has-sold-9-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine million as of the end of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>In CAPCOM's list of all-time bestsellers, this puts the Resident Evil 4 Remake at the seventh spot, narrowly surpassing the Resident Evil 3 Remake but still around a million short of Resident Evil Village. Still, there's no doubt that this was a highly successful product. In time, it could overtake Resident Evil 2 Remake, which currently stands as CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time with 15 million units sold.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch noted a few of the game's faults, after remarking that it's still a very good game:</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 4 was the ultimate test of Capcom’s remake skills, and unfortunately, they buckled a bit under the pressure. The game suffers from minor mechanical issues and doesn’t reinvent or elevate the original material as boldly as some might have hoped it would. That said, Capcom hasn’t broken anything either as this is still a fun, inventive thrill ride that has been brought up to modern technical standards in striking fashion. The new Resident Evil 4 is well worth it for fans of the series, just keep your hopes slightly in check and you won’t be spin-kicked by inflated expectations.</em></p>
<p><em>I may be a bit disappointed by the scope and ambition of Capcom’s reimagining, but RE4 is still one of the most inventive and engaging action-horror games ever made, and this is a competent, technically-impressive new version of the game. The village battle may be largely the same, but it still gets your blood pumping. Same goes for the cabin defense sequence, your showdown with the village chief, or your first encounter with a Regenerator. The RE4 remake is still a fun, bombastic dose of mayhem, I just feel like it had the potential to be even better. It also suffers from the fact that Resident Evil Village was, in some ways, the bigger, crazier take on RE4 that this remake could have been.</em></p>
<p>According to rumors, this should be a big year for fans of the survival horror franchise, as CAPCOM is gearing up to reveal Resident Evil 9. When it comes to the next remake, the rumor is that it should be Code Veronica's turn, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't be as extensive as RE4</a>.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A group of tabletop game makers and other American small businesses are filed a lawsuit on Thursday against President Donald Trump and his administration to attempt to stop his tariffs. The lawsuit alleges the tariffs are “unlawful and unconstitutional” and details how they are creating challenges for the plaintiffs’ businesses.</p><p>The tabletop companies that are among the plaintiffs in the case include Stonemaier Games (which announced its involvement in the lawsuit earlier this week, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/562620/stonemaier-games-trump-tariff-lawsuit-wingspan-developer">as reported by <em>Polygon</em></a>), Spielcraft Games, Rookie Mage Games, XYZ Game Labs, and Tinkerhouse. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/646604/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-pause-canada-mexico-china-de-minimis">145 percent tariffs</a> imposed on goods imported from China are a significant part of the burden, as spelled out in examples in the lawsuit:</p><div><ul><li><span>Stonemaier Games, which has its products printed at a factory in China, has imports that are “ready to ship on which it estimates it will pay millions in tariffs pursuant to the actions challenged herein.”</span></li><li><span>Spielcraft Games has paid $4,335.40 in tariffs for “a board game set” that it imported from China this month.</span></li><li><span>Rookie Mage Games has paid $3,120.80 in tariffs for “products imported from China” this month and will have to pay tariffs on “all future imports.”</span></li><li><span>XYZ Game Labs estimates that it will have to pay “substantial tariffs” on goods manufactured in China that it plans to import later this year and on “all future imports.”</span></li><li><span>Tinkerhouse is producing a “tabletop roleplaying game accessory” in China that the company has made a down payment on. The company estimates it will have to pay “substantial tariffs” on when it imports the accessory later this year. It also expects that it has to pay tariffs on “all future imports.”</span></li></ul></div><p>Other plaintiffs in the case include Princess Awesome, a clothing company, Mischief Toy Store, a toy store based in Saint Paul, MN, and others. The lawsuit was filed on Thursday with the US Court of International Trade.</p><p>The lawsuit from the small companies joins a growing list of parties fighting the tariffs in court. On Wednesday, 12 states <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/state-attorneys-general-lawsuit-trump-tariffs">sued the administration</a>, with New York Attorney General Letitia James calling the tariffs “unlawful” <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2025/attorney-general-james-and-governor-hochul-announce-lawsuit-against-trump">in a statement</a>. The CEO of Learning Resources, a toy company that also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariffs-economy-trump-ceo-lawsuit-learning-resources-ceo-rick-woldenberg/">told CBS MoneyWatch</a> that “this path is catastrophic.”</p><p>However, the future of the tariffs is also murky right now, with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69">reporting yesterday</a> that the Trump administration is thinking about reducing the tariffs on China</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-gennojo-ally<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For those who haven't played it, a central component of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is the 'League', a loose cohort of friends and allies you pick up along your travels. They all hang out at your hideout, can be chatted with, have a handful of story missions each and can be called upon to unleash extremely cool special attacks in the middle of a battle.</p><p>Most of these are memorable characters, rogues and misfits all, and I'm glad I went to the trouble of recruiting them. There's Yaya, the reluctant, brawling monk, who can burst into the middle of a fight and knock your opponents on their ass. There's Katsuhime, the tough-as-nails, pragmatic sniper who I <em>absolutely </em>romanced as Naoe. And there's Oni-yuri, the two-faced orphan who you can never be sure is telling the truth, but can always be sure will help you out by blowing poison darts at some bad guys. I love most of them.</p><p>Then there's Gennojo. Who fucking sucks. I hate him so much.</p><figure><figcaption>Absolutely not, you creep</figcaption></figure><p>I encountered Gennojo--a thief--quite early on in the game, and his energy can best be described as "what if Lando Calrissian was broke and also a convicted sex offender". From your first conversation he's incredibly annoying, and making matters worse is that, playing as Naoe, he is <em>constantly </em>trying to romance you. Like, almost every single time you're given a dialogue option, one of them is for romance, leading to a series of conversations that (and I'm paraphrasing here) go something like this:</p><p>Naoe: Phew, we sure showed those bad guys</p><p>Gennojo: Yes. Now, let me kiss you</p><p>Naoe: No. Anyway, what's the plan? Are there more bad guys around?</p><p>Gennojo: Perhaps. Let us kiss, and think on it</p><p>Naoe: What the fuck is wrong with you</p><p>Gennojo: *makes kissing face*</p><p>It's <em>incessant</em>, and stands in wild contrast to the rest of the game's cast, where, like most <em>Assassin's Creed </em>games, everyone is somewhere on the character spectrum between "stoic" and "stoic, but also haunted by their past misdeeds". And it's not like he's comic relief, either; the guy just plain sucks, wavering constantly between pathetic sexual advances and melodramatic whining about his lot in life. If anything, he seems to exist solely as a test of Naoe's (and the player's by extension) graces.</p><p>Thankfully, membership in Naoe and Yasuke's League is by invitation only. At the conclusion of a small series of missions for each prospective member, the player is given a choice: they can either sign them up, or bid them farewell and never see them again.</p><p>I have never said "get the hell out of my face" quicker in a video game when given that option with Gennojo, and interestingly, doing so gives you one last choice. You can either stop him doing something incredibly stupid by punching him unconscious, or you can let him do this:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gennojo Killed Himself Assassin's Creed Shadows Cut Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lFt9JvYFAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I need you to understand that, no matter how Naoe has been animated there at the end, if you choose the latter this is not a tragic moment. It is comedy. This guy, this schmuck, whose only motivations throughout the entire game have been to steal stuff and make unwanted sexual advances on the player character, has suddenly decided that he is going to blow himself up inside a storehouse full of rice, and that this is somehow going to...accomplish something?</p><p>It accomplishes jack shit! Naoe even says this to his face, quite plainly, and true to his character he doesn't listen. Even this guy's heroic martyrdom is a whiff. </p><p>I honestly cannot remember the last time a character in a video game who is supposedly on your side--an unlockable ally with gameplay benefits, no less!--had so few redeeming qualities. Like, this guy has <em>none</em>. He's just the worst, every line and deed an ordeal, and I cannot imagine the headspace of anyone who went into this game, endured his encounters and thought yes, I would like to invite this man into my secret and very cool league of assassins so I can spend <em>more </em>time with him. As for anyone who actually <em>romanced</em> him, well...I'd say "I'd love to hear why", but I don't think I actually do.</p><p>Whoever dreamed this guy up at Ubisoft, whether painting his broadest brushstrokes or writing each specific line of dialogue, if your intention was to make the Worst Guy Ever as a joke, as a bit, I would like you to know that you absolutely nailed the brief. Well done.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ice-water-games-tenderfoot-tactics-xbox-store-removed-bds"><h3>Indie Dev Who Pulled Game From Xbox In Solidarity With Palestinian-Led BDS Hopes Others Will Do The Same</h3></a><p>"It's important to be able to use that limited amount of power to put whatever pressure we can on things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms"><h3>AI Has Come For The Horse In The Hospital</h3></a><p>Google's AI tries to define idioms users made up</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> announced that both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> would be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">getting offline modes</a>, something quite likely driven (pun intended) by how upset people were by the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> being shut down completely. There's an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-the-crew-lawsuit-insists-we-do-not-own-the-games-we-buy">ongoing lawsuit</a> over the first game and all! Still, The Crew 2 and Motorfest getting an offline mode is something, and there's a playtest for the former coming next week, April 30th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Producer Gregory Corgie shared this in a quick update video (you can watch that below) that mostly focuses on The Crew 2, as that's the one that'll be getting an offline mode first. It's probably worth noting that not everyone is guaranteed access to the aforementioned playtest, it'll be based on their individual "configurations and previous involvement in the community." Don't worry about your save either, as it'll be a separate one made for the sole purpose of testing the offline mode.

<p>
As it stands, the developer is apparently planning to release a hybrid mode, meaning you can switch between on- and offline, by the end of this year. The reason you're not getting an outright offline mode right out the gate is pretty much just because the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> game was designed to be an always online game, so Ubisoft need to actually make sure an offline mode works 100% of the time.
</p>
<p>
Corgie also made sure to make it clear that no, online multiplayer features won't be available in offline mode, though this won't apply to all aspects of the game. Not entirely sure if this point needed to be made, but he did also say a full list of what features will and won't work will be coming further down the line. I imagine that'll actually be a useful thing to hear other than the obvious difference between online and offline gameplay.
</p>
<p>
I do have to wonder if the existence of an offline mode for The Crew 2 and Motorfest will hinder Ubisoft at all in the ongoing lawsuit against them. They argue that those that purchased the game were "purchasing a license" to play it, not to own the actual game, which is obviously a stinking pile of "um, actually…", so it's a matter of waiting to see if that argument works out for them.

The alpha was originally going to be NDA’d but Bungie ended up lifting that requirement after many content creators balked at the provision. And while there’s definitely still plenty of polish to be added to the look of <em>Marathon’s </em>world, its UI, and other visual elements, things seem to be running well under the hood. No real bugs, no real performance issues on PlayStation 5, and no problems matchmaking or staying connected. </p><p>But while the moment-to-moment gameplay in <em>Marathon </em>can be solid, the alpha left us with a bunch of questions about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-price-free-bungie-shooter-pvp-sony-concord-1851775949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-price-free-bungie-shooter-pvp-sony-concord-1851775949">Bungie’s new shooter can succeed</a></span> and what will set it apart in an ever-more-crowded field of established alternatives.</p><hr><p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: Still waters run deep. Can we say the same about <em>Marathon</em>?</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:<em> </em></strong>You can only answer that if you got an alpha code. Which both of us did. And while I don’t have an answer for your smarty-pants philosophical question, I do have thoughts on <em>Marathon</em>! Not all of them positive. </p><p>I spent a lot of my time playing and then thinking about this game and going “Hmmm...”</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>It’s in a very weird spot! At least what’s playable in the alpha—two maps, four runners, and a couple of contracts.</p><p> As someone with a need to watch XP and faction rep meters fill up, I felt surprisingly un-obsessed with <em>Marathon </em>after playing a couple hours (the game has some of that stuff but it wasn’t enough to overcome my ennui). Still, the conundrum of what <em>Marathon</em> may or may not end up being is something my mind keeps coming back to.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. After a few hours of playing <em>Marathon’s </em>alpha—which as you mention is not the full game—I’m not really hungry to hop back in. And I’m also not sure who this game is actually for...</p><p>The alpha feels too watered-down to attract the extraction sickos who have 2000 hours in <em>Tarkov</em>. But it still feels like it’s going to be too punishing to attract casual <em>Destiny </em>players and battle royale fans.</p><p>I saw someone, can’t remember who, tweet that the game is like <em>Apex Legends: But Now You Lose Everything When You Die Edition</em> and that’s not completely fair, but not that far off either.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> The pitch for this game is something like, “What if the extraction mode from a free-to-play <em>Call of Duty</em> game played like<em> Destiny 2</em> and was priced somewhere in the middle?” And when you say it like that it’s hard to get excited, but moment-to-moment the gunplay is on point and the art direction and world itself have me very intrigued.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>On paper that pitch is really a hard sell. And trying to convince some friends to play this has been a struggle. </p><p>But yeah, the gunplay feels really, <em>really </em>good. At one point I was fighting some NPC bots in a trippy sci-fi warehouse with weird lights and it was awesome. Then I had to rummage through their loot for some items and got killed by a player seconds later and lost everything.</p><p>The problem was that I ended up just thinking, “Man, I wish this wasn’t an extraction shooter that forced me to play with randos to survive!” Which I doubt is what Bungie was going for with the alpha. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Tell me more about why losing loot is such a buzzkill for you. It’s definitely something I think will be polarizing for certain types of Bungie fans but it doesn’t bother me personally.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think the problem is that, as you mentioned, there’s not enough (in the Alpha at least) other STUFF to work toward. </p><p>So if you drop in with a cool gun you successfully extracted with but you get insta-killed by some rando with a sniper, it feels bad. I made no progress on in-game challenges, because they aren’t a thing (and don’t seem to be a thing in the full game) and I didn’t complete any contracts. And that cool gun and everything else is gone. And if that happens a few too many times, it feels really punishing.</p><p>And like, in <em>Fortnite</em>, even bad matches don’t really punish me that much. I don’t lose anything and I’m always making progress on like 200 different challenges and my battle passes.</p><p>But with <em>Marathon </em>(and other extraction shooters) you can have a run of bad matches that just feels awful. And I’m not sure, without some big changes, that Bungie is going to get a <em>Destiny</em>-size community to support <em>Marathon</em>. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> For a game about grabbing loot, that part was definitely the least exciting to me. I think that’s partly about the narrow scope of what’s available in the alpha but also partly an issue with how anti-climactic the flow and drama of matches feel.</p><p>Showdowns with other players were very few and far between, and usually ended before both sides could fully engage. The loot caches all sort of run together in my mind, and there was a surprising lack of interesting enemies. </p><p>Occasionally there’d be an invisible security unit or beefier elite but I experienced very little in the way of big moments like, “oh, we found great loot!” or “oh, we’re in a mini-boss fight!” or “now we’re in a shootout to get to the extraction point.” None of that really “popped” for me.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Matches tended to blend together for me. I don’t really have many “COOL STORY” moments to share. And yeah, combat with other players is pretty rare and tends to be the worst part of this game. </p><p>I feel like the time-to-kill is so short in this that I could drop people with anything and they, in turn, could do the same to me. So fights weren’t about who had found some cool gear or had a smart spot, but just “Who spotted who first and pulled the trigger?”</p><p>It led to a situation where I started to get annoyed and bored with NPC bot fights and would just get a few cool items/guns and extract. But then, I started to wonder why I was even looting guns if I was mostly avoiding or dreading combat with NPCS and rarely saw other players or felt like my guns mattered.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I was, frankly, shocked how little we ran into human opponents while playing. The max map capacity is currently 18 teams of three players. I’m not sure if that’s a tech limitation or calibrated to limit chaos but something is off about the density of “things to do” on the map right now.</p><p>It feels like there needs to be a lot more AI enemies, or the matches need to be shorter and that threat needs to ramp up more quickly. I can imagine much more exciting scenarios where players are too busy trying to survive to really stab one another in the back at the end of a round, but as it stands the matches didn’t follow any memorable arcs.</p><p>That’s not to say they’re boring moment-to-moment, because you are constantly on the lookout for threats and optimal routes, high ground, good cover, loot, etc. But there’s a glaring hole at the center of what’s in the alpha right now.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong>  I do think, as I realized how safe I usually was in most areas, I did get a bit bored of it after a few hours.</p><p>But I wonder if the number of players is directly tied to the size of the maps, which aren’t massive. And yeah, I agree. I was shocked by how much of the game was me running around the map collecting random sci-fi gear while never seeing other players. </p><p>Speaking of the maps, neither of them are great! And I’m not talking about the rough-looking outdoor areas. (Which I assume will get a few more passes before September’s launch.)</p><p>Both maps in the alpha lack any memorable regions or interesting landmarks. It’s just a collection of a lot of the same-looking assets spread around an area in a maze-like fashion. Nothing remarkable.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> It’s ironic that you spend the game playing as synthetic “shells” that are printed anew each time you die because I can totally imagine a really fun, compelling PVP experience inside the “shell” of what <em>Marathon </em>appears to be at the moment. Based on what we’ve heard about the final game, though, I’m not sure there will be enough bold design swings or interesting ideas to make it feel alive. </p><p>I can’t tell you what Bungie should do but I can tell you a few things are missing right now. The recipe’s a bit bland, like a pizza cooked to perfection but the sauce is too thin and the crust tastes like water.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Do you think this game comes out in September as planned? Because based on the negative or middling reactions I’m seeing online, I’m wondering what the vibes are inside Bungie and if there is any possibility that this thing gets delayed until 2026 so they can make some bigger changes. So they can spice up the pizza and add more toppings. </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I don’t think it comes out. And if it does, it will be because Sony doesn’t believe in it and is ready to move on. I think there will be a public beta around July or so and based on the level of participation and buzz coming out of that, a call will be made then.</p><p>But I hope I’m wrong and it comes together in the final product because I truly do love the lore and vibes. I very much want a reason to exist in that world and see where it goes in a way that I did not with <em>Concord</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-recommend-id="image://9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-recommend-id="image://9f015dc7fe6206a9125290a9dd294009" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Same!

I think Bungie, given a bit more time, could tinker with what is here and end up with something that blows up and becomes a big hit. And I want to see that happen. </p><p>But I’m not convinced, after playing the alpha, that <em>Marathon </em>is going to succeed. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fvbEnWLRo1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fvbEnWLRo1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I hope I’m wrong, if only so we keep getting more awesome short movies like that last one.</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, I think they need to make a decision. Is this going to be a fairly punishing hardcore extraction shooter or something that is designed to appeal to more players from more genres? And perhaps this is a debate raging internally at the studio and was part of the reason the NDA was lifted. Maybe they want to see what the reaction is, and different sides can use the online conversations to plead their case.</p><p>For now, I’ll probably play more of the alpha. See if it clicks more with me. How about you?</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I’ll definitely hop on a few more times and continue hunting for the magic. It’s by no means bad and it certainly feels better to play than some other extraction shooters. </p><p>There’s a lot that’s not in the alpha, so I don’t want to make up my mind too early based on just the roughest proof of concept. And because I’m a sicko I will definitely max out any ranks I can.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Same. The shooty-shooty bits are fun enough and the world is neat. I hope it all comes together in the end. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
