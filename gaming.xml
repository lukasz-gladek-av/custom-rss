		<p>Prologue is the start of something. When you understand what Brendan Greene and the team at PlayerUnknown Productions are attempting to create – its ambition, its scope, its real-world applications – then you can understand both the blazing focus of Greene’s vision, and why Prologue: Go Wayback! is a compartmentalised start within a new digital world.</p>
<p>Brendan Greene is a modern day video game rock star. There’s little other way to describe a man who redefined the online shooter, first via the modding scene for Arma and DayZ, and then by building <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG Battlegrounds</a>. It’s afforded him a unique position, creating PlayerUnknown Productions, and letting him head off to experiment and explore what is possible, not just within video games, but in the way we communicate and interact with each other digitally. It’s wildly ambitious, and almost too big for even his own team to fully grasp. But first, there’s Prologue.</p>



<p>Prologue is a survival game, set within a map that changes every single time you play. That, in and of itself, isn’t particularly groundbreaking. We’ve seen No Man Sky, Valheim and others match survival crafting to a procedurally generated world, but Prologue is taking a different approach to it because this is, the team hope, a new beginning for the creation of worlds.</p>
<p>Prologue marries machine learning with procedural generation, systems that are interlocked and intertwined in such a way that they can create surprising, meaningful landscapes. The difference here is scale. While Prologue’s map is an ‘achievable’ 8km x 8km (for context, that’s the size of Skyrim’s map), it’s also a proof of concept that sits alongside the Preface: Undiscovered World tech demo, with the end goal of creating a system that can form and create whole planets, whole ecosystems – sitting down to talk, Greene utters the word ‘Metaverse’, but is obviously conflicted about doing so.</p>

<p>He leans in, broadening the scope of what they’re working on, saying, “I hate using the word Metaverse. I really do, because it’s got such a dirty stink to it now, right? Because no one’s building it. The metaverse is the internet, but in 3D essentially, that’s what we’re trying to do here. I’m trying to provide an open-source world creation engine, like the [Star Trek] Holodeck, where it’s quite easy for you to create your own world, your own experience, your own part of the world.”</p>

<p>Prologues come first, though, and our early look gives us a clear picture of the first game in this project. We’re met with the immediate instruction that Prologue is a hard game, with Creative Director Scott Davidson telling us, “If you find that it’s easy, it’s probably a bug”. We’ve been given a window into an early, though perfectly functional build, but there’s a sense of fact-finding, testing the water to see how our small group of press get through this initial demonstration.</p>
<p>Prologue has a simple and straightforward goal: make it to the weather station. That simple task is warped, moulded and wrangled by the resources you have access to, your ability to read a map and visual topography, and the weather. Here, the greatest enemies to your survival are a lack of food, water or setting out into the bitter, deadly cold of a snowstorm.</p>
<p>You’re dropped into a cabin. It contains a selection of necessary tools, like a map and compass, as well as a hammer for making repairs and a pair of binoculars for looking out across the world. Hopefully, there’s also some food lurking in the drawers or in the fruit bowl on the counter, and you can fill up your inventory with as much as your small backpack is capable of carrying. Besides that, you’ve got four fast-access equipment slots, and then you can’t carry any more.</p>

<p>You can feel the legacy, and the cadence of Greene’s PUBG. Battle Royale fans will recognise the drive to collect better equipment, to make the most of their starting loadout, and the need to set out across the map in search of the end game. That’s the Weather Station, and while it’s reductive to say that it feels as though success is hard won, this is a game that seems to delight in killing you. Death by exposure, starvation or dehydration come quickly and repeatedly, and though its painful, a streak of realism is at the heart of the team’s drive.</p>
<p>Your immediate decision is whether to run out the door, or to stay in the relative safety of your cabin, exploring, gathering and preparing for the long journey to the weather station. Depending on where you drop, the station will be between 3 and 6 kilometres away, introducing the element of chance and variety that it feels as though will be a hallmark of both Prologue, and its ambitious technology.</p>
<p>I play PUBG like a game of hide and seek, with an unwelcome surprise for you or the seeker at the end of the game. It’s little surprise that I gravitated to shoring up my cabin, staying warm by keeping a fire going, and repairing broken windows to keep the heat in. You can stay here for hours if you want, but aside from your essential food supplies, there is a finite supply of diesel for your generator. It gives some urgency to your foraging, assuming you want to keep the lights on. Heading out, collecting more and better equipment, each of these tiny successes micro doses of dopamine have the effect you’d expect. You want to play more, and you want to get to the weather station.</p>
<p>From the creaking of the trees in the wind to the constant crunch of your footsteps through the world, there’s a bleakness and loneliness of spirit to the game’s central loop that some might find unsettling. Brendan hopes that people will take time to appreciate that time alone though, saying, “Prologue is a lonely space, but you can just wander in the forest, set up your cabin, make it nice and cozy, sit there by the fire, right, and just have it on the background while you read a book. Then you can just read a book in front of your computer – you don’t actually have to play the game.”</p>

<p>Once again, that speaks to a game and an experience that hopes to be more than its base parts. Early Access is the perfect way to introduce the world to Prologue. This is a game that’s mid-development, and which, the team say, needs the community to help direct it moving forward. Scott tells us, “We’re making the type of game that would be very hard to make without player feedback. You can’t focus group your way to success.” He continued, “It needs that back and forth from the community, it needs for them to be engaged in the process, and to want to build something.”</p>
<p>Prologue is undoubtedly part of an exploration. One part technological and another fundamental to the human experience. Striving to survive in an ever-changing world, learning to appreciate the sounds and the solitude of that journey. It’s an ongoing process, one that has potential and pitfalls, but it feels as though this could be the start of something. A prologue to our digital future that rests on the most fundamental human need – it’s a glorious and tantalising juxtaposition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has announced the release date of its upcoming game, Dune: Awakening. Previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled for Q1 2025</a> on PC, the survival MMO will now debut on May 20, priced at $49.99. Pre-orders will begin soon, said Funcom, promising the in-game bonus Terrarium of Muad’Dib, a beautiful in-base decoration that houses the iconic desert mouse.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, the Norwegian developer has released both benchmark and character creator. Players can download the former to check how well their PC will run the Unreal Engine 5-powered Dune: Awakening while the benchmark goes through an ornithopter flight and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm. With the latter, players will be able to create their characters starting today, which will then be importable into the full game on May 20.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DA_MuadibCage_2K_02-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>They must undergo the Gom Jabbar test and fine-tune every aspect of their appearance, as well as pick their home planet, their caste, and their mentor, which is tied to different combat schools: Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. This choice also determines the player character's starting abilities, though the game later opens up access to all schools, letting players mix and match abilities from any of them to create their own play styles. Those who play both benchmark and character creator will get a complimentary Frameblade knife skin at launch.</p>
<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-develop-games-dune-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secured the license</a> to develop Dune games in early 2019, before any of the movies were released. Shortly afterward, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Tencent, which allowed them to increase the scope of this project. Now, the studio is calling this 'the most ambitious survival game ever made', and it might just be correct based on what we've seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2J60DGHWLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can find our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer Q&amp;A</a> at the respective hyperlinks. On PC, the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjnEiP9a9kQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards. A console version of Dune: Awakening is highly likely, but will come at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has responded to a lawsuit brought against it by ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett, whose employment was terminated by the&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer last year following allegations of misconduct.</p>

<p>Barrett brought the suit against Sony in December, alleging that the company, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">is Bungie's parent</a>, engaged in a "sham" investigation in order to support its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">termination of his contract</a>.</p>

<p>However, as spotted by Stephen Totilo of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, Sony has now filed a response, and the 128-page document contains evidence that Sony says reveals Barrett's "pattern of misconduct" with regard to his communications with female employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=HzhTMBAC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=uuMNcmc8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett is suing Sony, but Sony has a thing or two to say about that.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can probably imagine, the document is extremely extensive and exhaustive. It contains answers to many of Barrett's claims in his own suit, but most explosively, it includes several exchanges Sony says are evidence of Barrett's attitude towards female employees.</p>

<p>The exchanges include Barrett allegedly telling a female employee she was "hot" and asking her what she thought her best and worst physical features were, as well as telling another employee he would "hit on [her]" if she wasn't being treated well by her boyfriend.</p>

<p>He asked the same employee what "the steps one would have to take" to date her were, asking "what's the strategy guide". To another victim, he said he didn't want her boyfriend to "get the right idea" about the messages he was sending her.</p>

<p>There are several more text exchanges like these, and if they are indeed legitimate, then I think they're pretty damning with regards to Sony's motive for firing Barrett.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=l_rlxe0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=5lJq3S9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Christopher Barrett has also worked on Bungie games like&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony goes on to say that Barrett's "predatory behavior" caused his victims to "seek guidance" from other employees on how to manage his "constant boundary-pushing".</p>

<p>Victims reported to HR that they were "afraid for their jobs during" the encounters with Barrett, but Sony says these employees were "placed...in a vulnerable position" in which they "felt compelled to engage with" Barrett in order to maintain "good standing".</p>

<p>In Barrett's original suit, he says he was a "scapegoat" for Sony and Bungie and that he was "falsely" accused of sexual misconduct, which Sony says is "outrageous considering the evidence". The company says the evidence provided in the document "will demonstrate his termination...was justified".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where this lawsuit goes next; none of this represents a definitive conclusion, of course, and Barrett will doubtless have responses prepared for Sony in due course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Supergiant Games has dropped the hot Warsong Update for Hades 2’s Early Access phase. It welcomes a ton of new content to the Underworld, including a new God, more content on the surface, and thousands of new voice lines, and it also gives us a peak into the next major update and addresses the full release.</p>



<p>Hades 2 Early Access is about the most reassuring content I played in 2024. I was worried the sequel wouldn’t be able to live up to the towering expectations of its predecessor. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-play-hades-before-hades-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades</a> was a success inside and out and introduced thousands (daresay millions) of gamers to the roguelike realm. Thankfully, Hades 2 Early Access is encouraging, and its Warsong Update is the next step toward completion.</p>



<p>The developer has explained everything you can find in the major update. It has so much for you to explore and find. But we also know even more is coming.</p>

<p>People not familiar with history can conceivably confuse Kratos with the God of War. In Norse mythology, it’s actually Tyr, but in classic Greek, it’s Ares. Hades 2 introduces Ares as a new God Melinoe can encounter.</p>



<p>His primary function is to interact with the Princess of the Underworld. But Ares also has a line of his own Boons to choose from.</p>



<h3 id="h-surface-tension">Surface Tension</h3>



<p>Supergiant Games says the Warsong update makes life above the Underworld even more dangerous: “Are you prepared for the&nbsp;Final Confrontation&nbsp;on the surface? Discover what lies beyond the Guardian of&nbsp;Olympus…if you dare!”</p>



<p>I haven’t reached it myself yet, but a new fight likely awaits. Make sure your loadout and setup are ready by the time you reach it.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-animal-familiar-amp-over-2-000-voice-lines-added">New Animal Familiar &amp; Over 2,000 Voice Lines Added</h3>



<p>One of Hades 2’s newest features over the original is Animal Familiars. You need to unlock the ability, but once you do, Melinoe can be joined by one of several creatures. The Warsong Update adds “<strong>One last animal companion</strong> to join your journey and aid you in battle.”</p>



<p>Plus, crank up the audio as “More than&nbsp;2,000 new voice lines&nbsp;and new events with most of the game’s cast!” have been implemented. This likely means all existing Gods have new lines to hear. Plus, Ares’ new dialog likely contributes to a large part of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-hades-2-early-access-major-content-update">Next Hades 2 Early Access Major Content Update</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has already announced the third major content update for Hades 2 is in the works and will be released “some months from now.”</strong></p>



<p>Early Access doesn’t stand still for long. It’s a chance for a game developer to keep improving a game, make it better, and present an excellent product before release. Hades 2 has already had two sizable updates, and the third one is already in development. </p>



<p>Given that we’ve had two major updates in nine months, I would expect the third major update to drop around <strong>July or August</strong> time.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hades-2-release-date-is">Do we Know When Hades 2 Release Date is?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Supergiant Games still can’t pinpoint the full release for Hades 2, saying: <strong>“It’s still too early to share our plans, including when our v1.0 launch will be.”</strong></p>

                <p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">WWE 2K25</a> features a Showcase mode that will let fans relive the past by taking part in several legendary matches. Essentially an interactive documentary--and hosted by "The Wise Man" Paul Heyman this year--2K Showcase: The Bloodline Dynasty will also allow players to alter the outcomes of these matches.</p><p>The trip down wrestling memory lane features a selection of classic bouts, including Yokozuna's infamous battle against Hulk Hogan at the 1993 King of the Ring, the brutal No Holds Barred match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rikishi, and the Royal Rumble 2022 showdown between Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.</p><p>Each match fits into one of three categories--Relive History, Change History, and Create History--and in total, 15 of them have been revealed so far. Here's the full list:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz8zsUmIBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tnz8zsUmIBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>Relive History</h3><ul><li>Yokozuna (with Mr. Fuji) vs. Hulk Hogan -- King of the Ring 1993</li><li>Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley -- RAW February 13, 1997</li><li>Nia Jax vs. Lyra Valkyria -- Queen of the Ring 2024</li><li>The Usos vs. The New Day (with Big E) -- Hell in a Cell 2017</li><li>Solo Sikoa vs. Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) -- NXT September 13, 2022</li></ul><h3>Change History</h3><ul><li>The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) vs. The Steiner Brothers -- WrestleMania IX</li><li>Rikishi vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin -- No Mercy 2000</li><li>Umaga (with Armando Estrada) vs. John Cena -- New Year's Revolution 2007</li><li>Tamina vs. Natalya vs. Carmella vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch -- Money in the Bank 2017</li><li>Naomi vs. Bayley -- Super ShowDown 2020</li><li>Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins -- Royal Rumble 2022</li></ul><h3>Create History</h3><ul><li>High Chief Peter Miavia vs. George "The Animal" Steele</li><li>The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) vs. The Dudley Boyz</li><li>The OG Bloodline vs. New Bloodline in WarGames</li><li>The Islanders (Haku and Tama) vs. The Street Profits</li></ul><p>Showcase Mode is typically one of the biggest highlights of a WWE 2K game, but this year's version of the mode is a big departure from previous instances, as it focuses on the Anoa'i family instead of a single superstar. The last couple of years in WWE programming have seen Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and several other members of that extended wrestling dynasty rise to prominence, while other WWE legends like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the late Umaga, and the Wild Samoans have all been praised for their contributions to the sports entertainment industry.</p><p>Beyond the Showcase mode, you can also hop on a boat and head to The Island--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-shows-off-its-new-open-world-island-mode-for-the-first-time/1100-6529460/">a new social space</a> that looks like it was heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City--take part in custom exhibition matches, and chart your own rise to the top as part of the MyRise mode. WWE 2K25 will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4 on March 14, but if you purchase the Deadman Edition or The Bloodline Edition, you'll get into the game a week early on March 7.</p><p>"With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-like-cody-rhodes-explores-what-comes-after-you-finish-the-story/1100-6529209/">WWE 2K25 preview</a>. "There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Not only can you do it yourself in Design Home, but now the game will let you become your own DIY star for HGTV with a new collaboration. For starters, a Fixer to Fabulous crossover has already kicked off in the mobile title. Next up are weekly challenges based on House Hunters, one of the most popular shows on the network.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fixer to Fabulous crossover began February 19 in Design Home, with weekly challenges called Bentonville Beauty and Arkansas Amazement. The partnership will also be reciprocated. An upcoming episode of Fixer to Faborlous--set to air on March 25--will see hosts Dave and Jenny Marrs playing the mobile title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMhq6vyZKv0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WMhq6vyZKv0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There's no date yet for the House Hunters challenges; EA says they will be coming soon. The company also states Design Home has seen 131 million players worldwide, and the HGTV collaboration isn't the first partnership for the game. For example, almost a year ago, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/design-home/news/design-home-sims-freeplay-interior-design-series" rel="nofollow ">renovation game partnered up with Sims Freeplay</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Design Home launched in 2016 and wasn't originally under EA's umbrella. That changed, however, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-completes-acquisition-of-glu-mobile-in-2-1-billion-deal/1100-6490777/">the company acquired Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion</a> in 2021. Design Home is still free-to-play but features in-app purchases. EA touts that actual brands, such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, can be utilized to decorate interior rooms in the game.</p>

                <p>The recent announcement that NetEase was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laying off some of its US-based Marvel Rivals developers</a>, including one of the game's directors, prompted concern and questions given that the hero shooter is performing well in the market <a href="https://ir.netease.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2025/02/20/3-04-13/Q4%202024%20Earnings%20Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with 40 million players</a>. Now, a clearer picture of what's going on and the context behind the shocking decision is coming into focus.</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published a report</a> in which he offered his take. Ahmad said there is "some truth" to how various Chinese game companies are downsizing their US operations due in part to "geopolitical risks" under the new Trump administration. However, there may be more to the story. Ahmad said the "full picture is more nuanced" and might also reflect NetEase performing a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p><p>In addition to the layoffs at the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase is Seattle--under a dozen people were reportedly affected--NetEase made a number of other significant drawbacks to its global games business. Ahmad pointed out how NetEase either closed or scaled down funding for Ouka Studio in Japan, Worlds Untold in Canada, and Jar of Sparks in the US. More recently, Just Cause creator Christopher Sundberg's new studio Liquid Swords announced cuts, as did Halo Infinite co-developer SkyBox Labs in Canada. Both teams were funded in part by NetEase.</p><p>"NetEase aggressively expanded its overseas footprint between 2019 and 2023, opening and investing in numerous studios outside China with the aim to develop high-end PC and console games," Ahmad said. "NetEase's recent decisions regarding its overseas investments and studio operations reflect a broader recalibration of its global strategy, driven by multiple factors. This change in strategy has impacted both US based studios and non-US based studios."</p><p>Ahmad went on to note that the "core" development team for Marvel Rivals is based in Guangzhou, China. This includes a second game director, Guangyun Chen, alongside the US-based director, Thaddeus Sasser, who was let go this week.</p><p>Also in his note, Ahmad said NetEase and other Chinese giants like Tencent and miHoYo invested significantly in overseas games and teams to try to reach players globally. However, Ahmad said a "turning point" for Chinese companies came in 2024 when Black Myth: Wukong, developed by a relatively small Chinese team at Game Science, broke out and became a giant success.</p><p>"The success of Black Myth: Wukong challenged the industry's assumption that only Western or Japanese AAA studios could produce globally competitive PC and console titles," Ahmad said.</p><p>So why did NetEase cut its US-based Marvel Rivals development team? We may never know the real answer, but Ahmad said it has more to do with "high costs and lower returns" over the past few years following a pullback after the boom of the pandemic. "Therefore, streamlining operations helps reduce costs and shorten development cycles, and NetEase is now following a new strategy both for these reasons and to mitigate risk from US-China policy changes," he said.</p><p>It's not just NetEase that's scaling back operations in the US, as the US video game industry has undergone turbulent times of late, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">thousands of layoffs rocking the business in the past few years.</a> These cuts come as some US-based video game companies, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including Electronic Arts, continue to see huge profits.</a></p>

Sony's often keen to be careful of high-profile conversations like this, and the pair had a rare opportunity to speak frankly about the highs and lows of creative leadership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Sony was probably happier with how this conversation went compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/sony-apologizes-after-completely-botching-interview-with-naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann">his previous public conversation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with another PlayStation employee...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Druckmann (who is also studio president at Naughty Dog, and executive produced the HBO series The Last of Us based on the video game of the same name), shared one anecdote that stood out in a conversation about grappling with self-doubt and "putting faith in the process."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The portrayal of a real-life religious shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has prompted officials at the shrine's real-world counterpart to take "action", according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Japanese platform <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250220-PF3AE6LOHRA6DGWT3APVNP6GLI/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sankei News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-real-life-japanese-shrine-officials-are-taking-action-over-ubisofts-portrayal-of-religious-site/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), officials at the Itate Hyozu Shrine, which is located in the Hyogo Prefecture and which can be visited in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' historical representation of Japan, are taking "appropriate action" over the shrine's depiction in the game.</p>

<p>Specifically, the officials appear to be taking umbrage at the fact that it's possible not only to visit the shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but also to destroy parts of said shrine, "including its altar and sacred objects" (as Automaton puts it).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=WNKK05DQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=1HC68NHq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has angered officials at a real-life Japanese shrine.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, the shrine's destruction isn't part of the game's main quest, and it also hasn't been used for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' promotional cycle, but that hasn't stopped some calling the very ability to destroy the shrine disrespectful.</p>

<p>Sankei News reports that shrine officials said they "would have refused" if Ubisoft had contacted them for official approval to include the shrine in the game, but that they were not approached by the studio.</p>

<p>It's not exactly clear what the Itate Hyozu shrine officials mean by "appropriate action"; that phrase is ambiguous, and it could mean anything from legal action through to simply requesting the shrine be removed from the game and anything in between.</p>

<p>In any case, it's far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has gotten into trouble regarding its historical accuracy or reverence for Japan. Back in July, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">apologized after including a Japanese re-enactment group's flag</a> in a book of concept art without the group's permission.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=3sFrmaN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=Hj1_taXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself at the center of a controversy.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">ongoing controversy surrounding protagonist Yasuke</a>, who's depicted in the game as a samurai, a classification that some folks are disputing from a historical perspective (although I rather suspect there's an unpleasant <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ulterior motive</a> to that argument in many cases).</p>

<p>Figurine company PureArts also issued an apology in October after pulling an "insensitive" figurine from sale. The figurine in question depicted a one-pillared Torii gate, a symbol that can famously be found at the Nagasaki Sanno shrine, which stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will be banking on&nbsp;the success of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>after what has been a rough year for the company. Flops like&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, as well as repeated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">delays</a> to&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>itself, mean the game is carrying rather a lot on its back.</p>

<p>If Ubisoft itself is to be believed, however, pre-orders for the game are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"solid"</a>, so the company may well have another big hit on its hands come March, when&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-presents-february-2025-officially-revealed-for-next-week.1114269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has officially announced a Pokemon Presents presentation for next week, and as you've probably come to expect by now, it's set to air on Pokemon Day.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/pokemon/status/1759850669333160265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Pokemon X account, the latest Pokemon Presents showcase is set for February 27th at 6am Pacific. That's around 9am Eastern and about 2pm GMT, in case you're wondering.</p>

<p>We don't yet know how long the showcase will be, but previous Pokemon Presents videos have been anywhere from around 10 minutes long to about 25 minutes, so expect something that's somewhere in that time range.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=7PfFw3mp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=L2p6k6D_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we finally be about to get more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info?</figcaption></figure><p>If past form is anything to go by, we can probably expect some updates for currently-running&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>(whose developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">might be about to sell up to Saudi Arabia's PIF</a>).</p>

<p>We can potentially also expect a new announcement or two, so this showcase might give us our first glimpse of the next major generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>The timing would track; the mainline games have been launching roughly every three years for the past few generations, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, so this year feels like the perfect time to announce whatever the next games will be.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is the Copperajah in the room at this point. We haven't heard much more about the game since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">its announcement during last year's Pokemon Presents show</a>, so hopefully, we'll get more info about it next week.</p>




<p>The timing of next week's Pokemon Presents might be slightly inconvenient for Nintendo given that the recently-revealed Switch 2 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to get its own Direct showcase in April</a>.</p>

<p>If Nintendo reveals any&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games coming to Switch 2, it might be jumping the gun on the console's launch lineup announcement (which will presumably come in April), but only covering games coming to the original Switch feels a touch odd in the shadow of the new console as well.</p>

<p>In any case, the next Pokemon Presents is due to air on February 27th at 6am Pacific. You can watch it over on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel.</p>

                <p>A recent report said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was at one point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-could-have-shuttered-xbox-prior-to-major-acquisitions-report/1100-6528826/" data-ref-id="1100-6528826">mulling the possibility of shuttering the Xbox division</a>. Before this, Microsoft's own co-founder Paul Allen's investment company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-cofounder-s-investment-group-calls-for-xbox-spinoff/1100-6415919/" data-ref-id="1100-6415919">called for Microsoft to dump Xbox and spin it off as a separate business</a>. That never happened, and now Nadella is speaking up to express Microsoft's commitment to gaming. He told <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dwarkesh Patel</a> that it's not true that Microsoft's investments in gaming is part of some kind of "means to some other end."</p><p>Microsoft has a long history of supporting gaming, Nadella pointed out, referencing how Microsoft Flight Simulator was a Microsoft product before the company even made the first version of Windows.</p><p>"So, gaming has got a long history at the company, and we want to be in gaming for gaming's sake. I always start by saying I hate to be in businesses where they're means to some other end. They have to be ends unto themselves," he said.</p><p>Nadella's comments came in response to a question about if Nadella had some kind of "premonition" about how gaming could help contribute to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Microsoft's push into the artificial intelligence space by using games to train its models. </a></p><p>"We are a company where we have to bring all these assets together and be better owners by adding value. For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit another major player count milestone, just a couple of days after the company closed the Seattle studio responsible for developing the hero shooter.</p>

<p>In its latest financial <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which covers both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the fiscal year as a whole), NetEase confirms that <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has amassed "over 40 million players to date".</p>

<p>The game, which launched in early December, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">amassed 10 million players</a> within its first 72 hours on release, going on to hit 20 million players in less than two weeks. It's worth stressing, however, that these aren't necessarily active players, just "registered users".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=M_PowDQp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-venom.jpg?itok=qVzOyGKX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has hit 40 million players, but that didn't stop NetEase closing its development studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, a quick look at&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' Steam numbers (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) shows that it's attracted 320,376 players over the last 24 hours, with 130,699 players enjoying the game at time of writing.</p>

<p>NetEase also says that the first season of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>resulted in a new surge of interest in the game, causing the hero shooter to catapult to the top of Steam's top sellers and most-played charts when it arrived.</p>

<p>All of this, as well as what is clearly NetEase's continued faith in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, makes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">decision to lay off everyone at the Seattle-based studio</a> responsible for making the game even more baffling.</p>

<p>In a statement, NetEase said the decision was made "for organizational reasons" and in order to "optimize development efficiency", so in other words, it's all to do with corporate behind-the-scenes goings-on, which is pretty much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">exactly what you'd expect</a> in this <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">day and age</a>, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=AoK2Gm_p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-40m-players-iron-fist.jpg?itok=KPMVE0pW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase is pledging to support&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for a long time to come.</figcaption></figure><p>As for NetEase's financials, they're not much to write home about. The company reported a very small revenue increase for the 2024 fiscal year, going from 2023's total of around $14.2 billion to about $14.4 billion in 2024.</p>

<p>Gross profit also increased slightly, as did net income. NetEase's fiscal year ended on December 31st, so these figures do probably include&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' numbers, but NetEase doesn't provide a full breakdown of exactly how much the shooter made for it last year.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, NetEase says it's got a pretty stacked slate of games to come, including mobile shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, hero FPS&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Marvel Mystic Mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>The studio is, however, also pulling funding or pausing projects for several of its other investments, including&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>creator Christofer Sundberg's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a> and Mac Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Untold Worlds</a>, among others. We'll have to wait and see what all of this means for NetEase's bottom line in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/el-paso-elsewhere-2-officially-announced-by-xalavier-nelson.1114248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/el-paso-elsewhere-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold have announced&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, a followup to the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-influenced 2023 shooter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lil6pnx6hk23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on his Bluesky account, Nelson says that it's "early days" for the sequel, but shares a title page for what is presumably its script. The page is pretty barren; it simply gives the name of the game, i.e.&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>, and Nelson's name as a writing credit.</p>

<p>Amusingly, a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/glassbottommeg.bsky.social/post/3likzdm4gus24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">couple of replies</a> give potential <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3likzmdt7ok2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">names</a> for the game, including&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Everywhere, All at Once</em>, referencing the popular 2022 comedy movie. Of course, the game will probably just end up being called&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2</em>. Ho hum.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=X5Pdwdqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/el-paso-elsewhere-2-gameplay-first-game.jpg?itok=BepxPOEY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>is officially happening, Xalavier Nelson has announced.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em>, it's a "third-person love letter to classic shooters" developed by Xalavier Nelson and his studio Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>The game revolves around James Savage, troubled protagonist and&nbsp;<em>Blade</em>-style enemy to vampires. Savage must descend into a motel that's suddenly gained a few extra floors thanks to a vampiric incursion.</p>

<p><em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>features a fully original hip-hop soundtrack composed by Nelson himself, and presumably, the sequel will feature more of Nelson's musical talents. It's also got "hordes of destructible physics objects", a fully-voiced campaign, and plenty of&nbsp;<em>Max Payne</em>-style slow-motion dives.</p>

<p>Naturally, we're almost certainly too early on in the development of&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere 2&nbsp;</em>to know what it'll play like, but if you want a refresher, you can check out the launch trailer for the original game here.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>itself, Remedy recently revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which are being developed in conjunction with Rockstar, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">are "making steady progress"</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, they don't yet have a release date, so if you want to remind yourself how much fun <i>Max Payne&nbsp;</i>and games inspired by it can be, you can check out&nbsp;<em>El Paso, Elsewhere&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010236" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/el-paso-elsewhere/9P1H1KJB032N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

And in a lot of ways it does feel cut from the same cloth as its predecessor, but there are also some very important ways in which it doesn’t. The biggest of those is speed. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Unless you’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257">mastered <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span> across multiple playthroughs, it can have a deceivingly plodding pace. You can run, jump, and explore anywhere you want. But <em>Elden Ring</em>, like other FromSoftware games, quickly teaches you to be wary of leaping before you look. Unexpected hazards and low-level enemies threaten to kill unsuspecting players around every corner. Through trial and error, <em>Elden Ring </em>trains its tarnished to be cautious, watchful, and prepared. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-beta-test-dark-souls-1851761180"><em>Nightreign</em> is the opposite of that</a></span>. The multiplayer roguelite is not technically a battle royale, but it can often feel like one. Giant birds carry you through the sky and drop you off at specified locations. A damage-dealing ring of blue light is constantly closing in around you and your teammates across a randomized map based on the original game’s Limgrave. You then race to grind XP and collect loot before a day-night cycle ends with a showdown against a past FromSoftware boss at the center of the map. <br></p><p>I played a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-fromsoftware-ps5-1851763458?_gl=1*nw4ssz*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDAwMTMzMi40OTMuMS4xNzQwMDAxNTA5LjM2LjAuMA..">few hours of <em>Nightreign</em>’s network test last weekend</a></span> and was surprised just how much the game encourages you not to dilly-dally. In addition to moving much, much faster than you do in <em>Elden Ring</em>, you also have to race against the clock to level up and find better gear in preparation for the scaling difficulty of the ensuing encounters. I thought our random trio would be methodically canvasing the map for secrets and fighting at one another’s backs. Instead, exploration was a chaotic scramble to ransack the map. </p><p>That is not the type of experience I associate with <em>Elden Rin</em>g, but that doesn’t make it a bad one. In some ways, <em>Nightreign</em> is closer to a multiplayer <em>Hades</em> than a traditional Soulsborne. Its action is more arcade-y, and the runs progress quickly and efficiently. And what can feel like a shallow free-for-all in the beginning comes into sharper focus during the boss fights which pit players against everything from Margit, The Fell Omen to a pack of three-headed hounds that spit fire. Here the pace slows back down some and offers a deep challenge more inline with the learning curves and the satisfying games of cat-and-mouse I associate with <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. </p><p>My squad and I weren’t able to finish any runs, ultimately dying each time to the Cerberus Night Lord with only half its health depleted. While you can revive companions by hacking away at their downed corpses, health potions are still finite and the last leg of the boss fight eventually depleted both our resources and our resolve. But even in failure I immediately wanted to plunge back into <em>Nightreign </em>and start a new run, not usually the feeling I get from  repeatedly dying in a FromSoftware game. That tells me <em>Nightreign</em>, while unorthodox, is on the right track, perhaps especially for those like me who enjoy the studio’s games but aren’t ride-or-die fans of them. </p><p>It helps that each run, win or lose, nets you new Relics that can be equipped for better stat bonuses on subsequent attempts. It’s this  loop, coupled with multiple classes (eight in the full game) and the teamwork around boss fights, that gives <em>Nightreign</em> a bit of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot flavor within its larger roguelite RPG framework. It’s not trying to be a live-service game, but it is the kind of thing I see myself getting the crew together to play in between <em>Rocket League</em> matches and <em>Helldivers 2</em> missions. It’s already been revealed that additional bosses and character classes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will eventually arrive in DLC</a></span>.

<p>Soulslike originators and imitators dominate the action-gaming scene. While this isn’t bad, the release of Lost Soul Aside could be a blessing in disguise for lovers of classic action titles with a sharp hack ‘n’ slash edge.</p>



<p>Let me preface by saying I need a Souls game every once in a while. Something to grind me down, make me feel useless, but make me feel like a God once I fell a great opponent—after an hour or two. I need insignificant mobs to cut me down and reduce me to human rubble. But even I’ll admit the genre has become saturated, so much so the art of a hack ‘n’ slash has died.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-2-black-remastered-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Remake</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> are almost remnants of a genre that used to be. But the tide could be turning with the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-lost-soul-aside-come-out">When Does Lost Soul Aside Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No bonfires here, my friend. Credit to Ultizero Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Lost Soul Aside releases on May 30 for multiple platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Did you know the thought process and development of Lost Soul Aside began in 2016? So this has been cooking for a while. The game’s director and company CEO Yang Bing has described Lost Soul Aside in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-may-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a> as: “Fluid, fast, and stylish that you never want to put the controller down. Kaser’s shape-shifting weapon adapts to your combat style. Are you a precise swordsman? A fan of devastating ranged attacks? Maybe you like high-speed mobility? Whatever your preference, the different type of weapons will serve you well.”</p>



<p>There’s a distinct and almost unmistakable Devil May Cry vibe about Lost Soul Aside. With less attention being given to DMC, Lost Soul Aside has the chance to fill a void.</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-platforms">Lost Soul Aside Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Expect to pick up a copy of Lost Soul Aside on either the PlayStation 5 or PC.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no Xbox love for Lost Soul Aside at present. Only the PlayStation 5 and PC are getting full launches for Ultizero Games’ new action title. The size, scale, and sheer detail of Lost Soul Aside make me question if a future <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port is possible. But never say never!</p>



<h2 id="h-lost-soul-aside-editions-amp-price">Lost Soul Aside Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, a Lost Soul Aside Standard Edition ($59.99/£59.99) and Digital Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£69.99) are the only ones available to purchase.</strong></p>



<p>Most new games come with at least three editions. That’s how I’ve been conditioned to think, so it shocks me when a AAA title only had a Standard and Deluxe Edition to choose from. It’s healthier on the wallet though.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at each edition and its price—so far.</p>

			<p>Despite dropping the mandatory PlayStation Network account sign in for single-player games on PC, looking at Lost Soul Aside, it looks like any single-player game published on PC by Playstation Publishing could still be blocked in unsupported countries.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-region-blocked-in-130-countries.1113747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1235001/info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Database </a>currently shows that the upcoming game developed by Ultizero Games will not be available for purchase in the 130 countries where the PlayStation Network is not available, despite mandatory account log-in having been dropped from the game as it was for other single player only games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-account-requirements-on-pc-dropped-for-spider-man-2-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-two-more-games/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part II Remastered and God of War Ragnarok</a>. Hopefully, this is just a leftover of the mandatory account login that has now been removed and will be rectified before launch.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside has been in development for a very long time, but its release is finally right around the corner<span>. It will launch, as confirmed during the latest PlayStation State of Play, which aired last week on<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;May 30th</a>. As mentioned above, the game originally required a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Network account sign in</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-playstation-network-account-pc/">&nbsp;to play</a>, but now users in countries supported by the PlayStation Network won't require an account to play the game on Steam.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software beta update is now available for users invited to test it out before the public release, introducing new Activities improvements, and more.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-feb-25.1114107/">ResetERA forums</a>, the new firmware update introduces new Activity improvements that make it easier for users to view details by fully displaying them on the card itself while still keeping spoilers hidden. The update also introduces support for Unicode 16.0 emojis, some Parental Control changes, improved system software performance and stability, and enhanced message usability on some screens. So, all in all, this looks like a minor update, although more features and improvements could be added before the update goes live for all users.</p>
<p>Activities, in particular, have been receiving some attention in recent PlayStation 5 system software updates, as the latest update, update <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-07-10-20-00-performance-improvements/">24.07-10.20.00</a>, made it so that each activity will display its current status. Besides improving specific features and enhancing firmware performance and stability, the latest updates have been pretty light since the latest major update, 24.06, which introduced the Welcome Hub, new Remote Play improvements, new personalized 3D audio profiles, and more. Everything that was introduced in the latest major PlayStation 5 system software update can be found in detail <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">here.</a></p>

            <p>Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life, the saying goes. (This is why so many games journalists are unemployed - ba-dum tish.) Thankyfully the next expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> seems to understand the permeable boundary between passion project and career as purely aspirational. It's called Businesses &amp; Hobbies and it lets Sims open their own tattoo parlour, pottery studio or - if you have the right complementary expansion - a cat café.

<p>Expansion packs are the largest of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> various DLC types, adding both new content and new mechanics, and Businesses &amp; Hobbies seems pretty rich. Your new businesses can offer a range of services, from classes to products to services like tattooing, with players able to tweak pricing, hire staff, and denote areas of shops that are accessible to staff only.
</p>
<p>Within that template, there's seemingly a lot of detail been added to the new skills. Tattooing, for example, will let you design your own custom designs, drawing on the skin of your Sims or using clipart-style shapes. You'll need your Sim to get gradually better at the skill if they're going to have happy customers, though, and there's a new mentorship system that allows your Sim to learn from existing experts in the field.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the aspirational element I referenced above, the expansion also adds two new cities, at least one of which looks to be somewhat inspired by Copenhagen, here rendered as "Nordhaven". Northern European countries seem like the sort of place where owning a successful small business or pursuing a creatively fulfilling careers might still be possible.
</p>
<p>I referenced cat cafés as one potential small business, but it's worth noting that this particular flavour of business is only available if you also own the previous Cats And Dogs expansion. There are several other previous expansions that can function alongside this new one, letting you open an acting school (Get Famous expansion), a spa (Spa Day Game Pack), or a laundromat (Laundry Day stufff pack). All of the details of complementary DLC <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/businesses-and-hobbies-expansion-pack">are listed in the announcement on The Sims site</a>.

<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will be released on April 13, 2025, and will consist of seven episodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-hbo-1236268901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, HBO announced The Last of Us Season 2’s release date and episode yesterday. The upcoming season will consist of seven episodes adapting the story of the second game from Naughty Dog’s series. It was revealed in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this month that each episode “packs quite a wallop,” and it is likely that the “story will extend past a Season 3.”</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 1 covered the entire first game of the series, so it will be interesting to see how Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann will divide the events from the second game across multiple seasons. However, the showrunners have reduced the number of episodes from 9 in Season 1 to 7 in Season 2. The creators will also mess around with time and how things are placed in a way that is appropriate for the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest trailer for The Last of Us Season 2 featured new cast members for popular characters from the second game, such as Isabela Merced as Dina and Kaitlyn Dever as Abby. The trailer also included some intense sequences with hordes of the infected creating havoc in different locations, like the camp, abandoned subway station, and more. </p>

                <p>Are you enjoying Avowed? Are you also a fan of growing kits? What about fungus? Well, you're in luck, because Obsidian Entertainment and North Spore have revealed that they're collaborating on a limited-edition <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit?srsltid=AfmBOooM2qgOl4rDGozwQIj3SmWoOhSd9iP1pN-jDoVNk6v6h1a4hGSY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avowed-themed growing kit</a>. It's set to ship out sometime later this month.</p><p>The Organic "Spray &amp; Grow" Avowed Mushroom Growing Kit is modeled after the Dreamthrall Elder Bear, an early-game boss in Avowed. In the game, the Dreamscourge disease has infected the Living Lands, and the bear has succumbed to its primal, savage urges. The infection causes organisms to sprout all over organisms, so a growing kit is certainly a thematically fitting collaboration.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446845,1300-4446844,1300-4446843,1300-4446842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"></figure><p>The kit costs $30 and comes with one of three different mushrooms: blue oyster, pink oyster, or golden oyster--it's a surprise which one you'll get.

            <p>
Last night, Microsoft trumpeted the announcement of Muse, a new "generative AI breakthrough" designed to aid "gameplay ideation".
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">published some grainy-looking gifs</a> of AI-generated gameplay footage, based on Xbox studio Ninja Theory's multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. (The images were miniature in size, presumably to avoid highlighting some of the wonkiness AI is known for.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, Microsoft made the claim that Muse would "radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future", and that the algorithm could be used to make older games compatible with "any device".
</p>

<p>
Reaction to Microsoft's announcement was swift, with social media awash with posts pointing out that, yes, Microsoft was absolutely jumping on the tech industry's AI buzzword bandwagon - but also the suggesting that Xbox was about to start using Muse to pump out AI slop. 
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, someone has done a better job than Microsoft itself of explaining what Muse is actually doing - and that person is AI researcher and game designer Dr Michael Cook.
</p>
<p>
For background, Cook is an expert on the subject of AI in games - he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-an-ai-win-a-game-jam">the guy who built an artificial intelligence to see if it could win a game jam</a> a full decade ago, whose work <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plastic-soul-one-mans-quest-to-build-an-ai-that-can-create-games">Eurogamer has covered on several occasions</a>. He's also a senior lecturer at King's College London, and has published and spoken extensively on the subject of AI.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-before-you-post/index.html">Cook lays out in an extended blog post on Muse</a>, the AI model is not generating gameplay or creating its own original ideas. 
</p>
<p>
In short, Muse was fed seven years of video footage of people playing a singular game - in this case, Bleeding Edge - to see if it could then generate further gameplay footage of it.
</p>
<p>
(If this all sounds familiar, it's similar to the process <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-reaches-grim-ai-milestone-replicates-playable-version-of-doom-entirely-by-algorithm">Google used to generate footage of classic first-person shooter Doom</a> last year.)
</p>
<p>
So, what's the point of all this? Well, as Cook writes, it's so Microsoft researcher could ask Muse to predict what might come next if changes to a game were made.
</p>
<p>
"They made a tool that let game developers edit a game level using existing game concepts like adding in a jump pad to a place where there wasn't one before," Cook explains. 
</p>
<p>
"They then gave this new level to their model, and asked it to show what it thought the footage of a player playing from this new position would look like."
</p>
<p>
In other words, the idea is Muse could be used as a shortcut tool for predicting and visualising how gameplay might adapt to a particular input by a developer. And, crucially, that developer is still a human.

Microsoft's research paper on Muse says the AI model is required to understand persistency, consistency, and diversity in order to succeed. In other words, if a human input is provided, the AI needs to ensure the effects of that input remain, whatever else is going on, and that the effects remain similar while adapting to a range of player behaviours.
</p>
<p>
For example, say a human adds a jump pad to a game's level. The paper says Muse must predict gameplay footage to reflect this which also ensures the jump pad persists (no deleting it!), that it reacts the same each time (it should always make players jump), regardless of what else is happening (this should apply even if a different player activates it).
</p>
<p>
"The paper is not really about 'generating gameplay' or 'ideas'," Cook continued. "It's about these researchers thinking about the implications of how people will work with these tools."
</p>
<p>
Notably, there's nothing in the paper that discusses the implications of Muse being added to the development processes of teams with a strong aversion to using AI, Cook notes. 
</p>
<p>
That said, in Xbox's blog post on Muse yesterday, Microsoft gaming AI exec Fatima Kardar stated that the company had simply "empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI" - suggesting there was no specific mandate from Microsoft to use AI, for now.
</p>
<p>
But even with Muse being just used for a limited purpose, Cook has further questions around whether it will ever be fully viable.
</p>
<p>
"This is not a practical process," Cook writes. "It's impressive that it can do this using visual information because things like lighting, camera angles, user interface and so on are a lot for an AI model to handle. 
</p>
<p>
"But ultimately, even with all of this data, all the time spent annotating datasets, and so on, it was still only just about able to generate footage predicting player behaviour."
</p>
<p>
Such a system currently lacks any practical use, is enormously expensive, and requires any developer already have a vast vault of gameplay footage lying around for Muse to ingest in the first place.
</p>
<p>
"The research team behind this probably believe it will get more efficient over time, which might make it more affordable or tractable for small developers," Cook continues. "However, it still raises the question of how we get video footage of people playing our game in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"If you've been in development for a couple of months then you won't have enough footage, and even if we make the systems able to run on less input data there must be a minimum level required to understand the full game logic. So I think there is a question here not just of whether it makes sense as a tool now, but whether it can ever make sense."
</p>
<p>
Lastly, on game preservation.
</p>
<p>
"You could imagine a world where, from gameplay data and video, a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run," Xbox chief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=225s&amp;ab_channel=Xbox">Phil Spencer said yesterday in a video on Muse</a>. "I feel that's really exciting."
</p>
<p>
Bluntly, Cook calls Spencer's comments "idiotic".
</p>
<p>
"I mean, in a sense anything is a preservation tool," Cook writes. "I could ask my friend's five-year-old son to draw a crayon picture of what he thinks the ending cutscene of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> looks like and that would still count as game preservation of a certain sort."
</p>
<p>
Despite a decade of AI growth, Cook says, there's no method yet to measure what exactly an AI model has captured and what it has not. Muse is able to provide grainy gifs of one fairly simple video game based on seven years of footage, but it is not a solution for holding everything about a game or every possible outcome of what players could do.
</p>
<p>
"This is absolutely not a solution for game preservation," Cook concludes, citing a <a href="https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/reports/37f6e434-73cf-43f5-8d7e-7ab37a6de832">report by gaming archeologist Florence Smith Nicholls about the archiving of digital games</a>. "What does it mean to preserve a gameplay experience? Even if this model was a perfect replication of the original executable software, this is not the be-all and end-all of game preservation. A generative model of what game footage maybe looked like once might be a nice curio on the side of a real preservation process, but it is always going to be inferior to other ways we approach the problem."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Strauss Zelnick weighed in with his opinion of AI</a>, saying that "artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> has now surpassed 32 million players a year after release, though lawsuits filed by Nintendo remain unresolved.</p>
<p>Developer Pocketpair shared the news on social media, with those player numbers across Steam, Xbox and PS5.</p>
<p>The news arrives as the game receives its <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1892412892508770560">latest update</a>, fixing crashes on Xbox and Steam Deck, reworking the Random Pal mode, and making various balance adjustments and bug fixes.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky year Pocketpair and its monster-catching game, which first caught the attention of players for its Pokémon-with-guns aesthetic.</p>
<p>Upon release, the game hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-has-clocked-up-2m-players-in-just-24-hours">two million players in just 24 hours</a> and its all-time concurrent player peak on Steam remains just over two million players. Two weeks later, the game had surpassed 19 million players across PC and Xbox Series X/S, with Microsoft touting it as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-19m-players-sees-biggest-third-party-game-pass-launch-ever">biggest third-party launch in Game Pass history</a>.</p>
<p>The launch was soured, though, by comparisons with the Pokémon series, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">fans calling the Pal designs "lazy"</a> due to their similarities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">game eventually arrived on Sony's PS5 in September</a>, to further expand the playerbase. And that will increase further once a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-headed-to-mobile-courtesy-of-kraftons-pubg-studios">mobile release arrives, developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios</a>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo dropped a major bombshell in September when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">statement back in January</a> it would "investigate and take appropriate measures".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">Pocketpair vowed to fight the lawsuit</a> on behalf of fans and indie developers. "Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo," it said. "Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world."</p>
<p>It added: "It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas."</p>
<p>In November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">Pocketpair provided further details on the lawsuit</a>, revealing it related to three patents filed by Nintendo between February and July of 2024, which relate back to a pre-existing parent patent from December 2021. These patents cover gameplay mechanics like capturing digital creatures and riding them.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">Pocketpair ditched its Pokéball-style summoning mechanic</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, Nintendo has filed a number of patent applications in the US, as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/yesterday-nintendo-received-a-u-s-version-of-another-anti-palworld-patent-and-asked-the-u-s-patent-office-for-an-interview-to-get-a-third-patent/">GamesFray</a>. These appear to relate to similar patents filed in Japan. However, at present there is no suggestion Nintendo is bringing US litigation against Pocketpair - for now, the lawsuit remains in Japan.</p>
<p>Still, development on Palworld is ongoing, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Pocketpair is adding an "ending scenario"</a> as part of its second year roadmap, as well as co-op crossplay. It won't be the end of Palworld, though, as community manager John "Bucky" Buckley confirmed to Eurogamer this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">ending has been "mapped out for quite some time"</a>.</p>
<p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky told Eurogamer, discussing the past year. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
