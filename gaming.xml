<p>As today is launch day, we now know who to thank for such musical bangers, and it's none other than the music group Monaca — the sound team behind the <strong>NieR</strong> series.</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment popped up on the <a href="https://monaca.jp/en/works/13333">Monaca website</a> today, crediting Keiichi Okabe, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Oliver Good, Keita Inoue, Taichi Joraku for the composition, and Ryuichi Takada for the arrangement.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2utjqvr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>The production studio was founded by Okabe back in 2004, and has since provided tunes for games and anime alike, even picking up the coveted 'Best Score/Music' award at the Game Awards 2017 for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a>.</p>
<p>The team has long served on the NieR series, though you'll also find their works in PS5 titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/foamstars">Foamstars</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>, and they even assisted on a handful of songs in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> soundtrack.</p>
<p>This is the first time they've had a Nintendo joint to themselves, mind you, and we are big fans of it. We described the score as "excellent" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">our review</a>, and have been leaping back to the music player on more than one occasion to listen to select tracks in isolation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-cracks-steams-all-time-top-10-worst-games-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-26-cracks-steam%E2%80%99s-all-time-top-10-worst-games-list.1345510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s user review system can sometimes be overloaded with user bombing and other unfair measures and tactics. However, the writing has been on the wall for Football Manager 26 since its early access beta, and Steam’s all-time worst games list has sadly welcomed it with open arms.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-open-beta-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Open Beta</a> was supposed to signal the welcome return of FM. Anticipation quickly turned to agony after it was found that the game was a bug-ridden mess with an unintuitive UI. Problems quickly piled on problems, and the comeback turned into a nightmare. The full release arrived, and as expected, players weren’t happy with the final product.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It wasn’t worth the wait. Credit to Sports Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer Sports Interactive said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Was Helped By Last Year’s Cancellation</a>. FM 25 was infamously delayed and canceled, putting a huge gap in the calendars of Football Manager fans.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launched to better-than-expected critical reviews. The FM community wasn’t as kind, and the game’s Steam store page was quickly filled with bad reviews, giving the game a ‘<strong>Mostly Negative</strong>‘ review reception.</p>



<p>This isn’t the end of the world, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 REDSEC launched to Mostly Negative reviews</a>. Yet, it’s still being enjoyed by countless users. For Football Manager 26, it went from bad to worse to <em>abysmal </em>very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> (through Steam250) found that <strong>Football Manager has moved to number seven on the all-time worst games list</strong> already. It’s better than Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight and FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction at least, but it’s a sight for sore FM fans’ eyes.</p>



<p>Strangely, there was no major day-one patch for FM 26 either. Even though it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-riddled-with-performance-issues-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riddled with performance issues on console</a>, it seems like fixes will be a slow rollout. This will surely risk the ire and patience of those who’ve committed to the game early doors.</p>



<p>This is no doubt a huge disappointment for you who’ve had to wait two years for Football Manager 26. Have you bought FM 26 in any way? More importantly, have you played it? Let us know what you think of it, what needs fixing, and if Sports Interactive has any hope of salvaging this mess through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> community has asked for bigger Conquest maps for months, so someone made their own – and they're actually pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have spent the time since launch asking EA and Battlefield Studios for everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">aim assist tweaks</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">realistic skins</a>, but few conversations have stolen the spotlight quite like the discussion around map sizes. While some players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">went to great lengths to determine if Battlefield 6 maps are as small as they look</a> and others <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">took to review-bombing</a>, the more creative individuals are using Battlefield Portal and REDSEC to make larger maps of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to work from Reddit users kurtinthegrind and andy_6170 (a.k.a. ViperAndyStudios), the Battlefield 6 community now has Club House, a large-scale Conquest play area that pulls elements from REDSEC’s Southern California-set Fort Lyndon map for an (unofficial) version of the kind of wide-open spaces they’ve been asking for. There are also Tech Center and Operation Tech Center map options, with the former set up as a large-scale, infantry-focused Conquest map, while the latter offers linear gameplay centered around one main building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The credit to the original version of Tech Center and the Conquest Script belongs to Andy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kurtinthegrind says</a>, “though I've made a few modifications to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Club House and the smaller version of Tech Center are my creations, and honestly, I'm not too proud of them. But until Ripple Effect/Battlefield Studios provides improved Portal support and releases ALL parts of Battle Royale map, these will have to suffice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bot and bot-less versions of the Club House and Tech Center maps are currently available for players to create servers, but it’s Club House that’s attracting the most attention online. In the middle of a Wednesday, the map, also known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oovku6/golf_course_is_the_best_bf6_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Course</a>, boasts a few hundred active players across different server browsers in Battlefield 6, with some 64-player servers populated almost entirely with real people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/img-4639-1762378638374.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Portal Club House Conquest Map Page. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We played a few matches on Club House and noticed that, even with around 30 players on each team, combat encounters feel spread out, with infantry required to sprint long distances to reach each Conquest objective without redeploying. Everything from small vehicles like golf carts to attack helicopters and tanks can help with travel, too, with above-average ticket sizes and a relatively large play area resulting in more room for vehicle warfare and lengthy matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is brilliant," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/comment/nmv6sa1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular comment</a> says. "Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s certainly a change of pace when compared to other, standard Conquest maps, and it’s an experience those playing on Club House seem to enjoy. Our short time with real-world players saw the in-game chat filled with comments praising the map for its long, clear sightlines and vehicular combat potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal game modes – Club House Conquest included – have dedicated fans, even if a modified XP rate means significantly slower progression for all. One Battlefield 6 player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ooadm9/for_the_first_time_i_felt_like_i_could_breathe_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to Reddit</u></a> after trying the mode for themselves, saying, “for the first time, I felt like I could breathe in this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are too many small, cramped, and poorly designed maps in this game, and I never had much opportunity to play normally without constantly confronting opponents in narrow alleys or buildings,” the popular post says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there should be maps like in BF3/4, small, medium, but also large - I know I haven't discovered anything new, everyone has been saying this since the game's release, but we need to keep talking about it until we finally get some comment on the matter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some have already begun calling for these fan-made maps to join official Battlefield 6 playlists, others argue the emergeance of Club House and other similarly large Conquest maps only serve as proof that Portal is working just as the developers intended. For now, it's unclear if Portal experiences like this could get a bigger spotlight from BF Studios.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although BF Studios has yet to confirm just how big future Battlefield 6 maps will be, we do know that much, much more is on the way. The first post-launch map, Blackwell Fields, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-map-blackwell-fields-in-the-firing-line-as-players-report-being-killed-from-as-far-away-as-enemy-hq-spawn-points">met with criticism from fans</a>, but another new map called Eastwood is just weeks away. Both locations are included as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch">Season 1</a>, with more content set to follow in the months ahead as future seasons roll out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 and REDSEC, you can read IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">REDSEC review in progress</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed last year's intense backlash to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the unexpected conversation shift "from gameplay to ideology" led directly to its high-profile delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a recent event at Paris Games Week, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameFile</a>, Guillemot screened a short internal video Ubisoft had created to narrate its response to the backlash surrounding Shadows' Black samurai co-protagonist Yasuke — <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/208502/news/assassins-creed-shadows-dev-addresses-musks-tweet-on-yasuke" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which even saw Tesla and X boss Elon Musk getting involved</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot has now stated that the level of vitriol required Ubisoft to rethink its plans for Shadows — back then, set for launch in November 2024. Ultimately, the company elected to delay the game until March 2025, a decision explained last year as necessary to "polish" the game further. But, behind the scenes, Guillemot says the firm understood it needed to bolster fan sentiment to ensure the game launched to a more positive response.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With more time to improve the game, Ubisoft gave itself the opportunity to share more with fans pre-launch, Guillemot said, something the company hoped would both impress long-term Assassin's Creed aficionados, and move the conversation around Shadows on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game — everything they were going to be able to rediscover — of what they love about Assassin's Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot said. "They’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games," Guillemot continued. "It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an internal video, also shown last week, Ubisoft described its response as a successful turnaround of public opinion on a game featuring a pre-launch crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences," the video begins, "only to become the game everyone loves to hate? When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In September 2024, we had our backs against the wall, and that's when it clicked," the video continues. "To get out of the corner, we had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies. So we stopped trying to win the argument, and leaned on what had carried us for 18 years: The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game. The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin's Creed game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has called on his fans to vote for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> as Game of the Year 2025 over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling multiplayer gamers “the minority.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Canadian Michael ‘Shroud’ Grzesiek, who specializes in competitive multiplayer first-person shooters, is a former professional Counter-Strike player who has built an enormous online audience. With 6.8 million subscribers on YouTube and 11.3 million followers on Twitch, his call to action has significant weight behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has thrown himself into Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders ever since its explosive launch, and in a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2610645158" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch stream</a> mobilized his community to vote for the game when it comes to The Game Awards 2025.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/gettyimages-1054359868-1762430155403.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shroud wants Arc Raiders to win Game of the Year 2025. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We gotta make sure that this game wins game of the year, by the way,” he said. “Do not let that Expedition game win game of the year. Do not let it. Absolutely do not. We all have to band together to make this game win. Us multiplayer gamers are the minority, okay. We are the minority being multiplayer gamers, but I believe we can win. I believe. You just need to tell everybody. I’ve never voted for anything ever, but I think I’m going to vote this year for this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, Sandfall's single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for Game of the Year, but Arc Raiders is being touted by some as a strong contender. Other candidates include Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, among others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Shroud’s comment about multiplayer gamers being in the “minority” ring true? Research from last year indicated that most gamers prefer single-player games, but there's a significant difference in preference depending on the age bracket. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midia Research</a> found that under 25s preferred multiplayer to single-player, with younger generations emphasising social play. But as you get older and it becomes harder to arrange time to play with friends, this preference shifts towards single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations,” Midia Research’s Rhys Elliott said in the report. “Convincing players — and their friends — to leave for new titles is a huge barrier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live-service games are the homes of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When people talk about the most popular video games in the world, multiplayer games tend to dominate. Roblox games that blow up, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, typically have a strong community element to them despite not being traditional competitive multiplayer. Fortnite is a multiplayer game through and through. Minecraft can be played either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dominant games on Steam, meanwhile, are competitive multiplayer: Counter-Strike, Dota 2, PUBG, Battlefield 6, and Apex Legends are, at the time of this article's publication, the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. And let’s not forget the likes of World of Warcraft and League of Legends, both of which are multiplayer games. There are huge single-player games, of course, but when it comes to sheer popularity, or monthly active users, free-to-play multiplayer games dominate the industry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, Shroud went on to claim that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said in the same stream. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers and public fan voting. The voting jury has in the past had more of an influence on the outcome. Keighley has said he’s considered going all in on public voting for The Game Awards, but expressed concerns about “social engineering.” It’s worth noting that The Game Awards has a purely fan-voted category called Players’ Voice. The Game Awards 2025 nominees are expected mid-November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Rockstar Games has pushed back against the claims that a group of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">recently laid-off developers were removed for trying to unionize</a>. Instead, these people were leaking company secrets, Rockstar said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Rockstar told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> that the staffers were "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public form." This violated Rockstar's policies, the company said. "This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>Between 30 and 40 people were fired from Rockstar's offices in Canada and the UK related to what the developer labeled "gross misconduct." A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said Rockstar is guilty of "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The union said the affected staffers sent messages within a "private trade union chat group" on Discord. The union acknowledged that outsiders were in the chat, too, but they were labor organizers.</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>In 2022, Rockstar suffered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-leak-was-really-frustrating-and-upsetting-take-two-says/1100-6511236/" data-ref-id="1100-6511236">massive leak that revealed the first footage and details about GTA 6</a>. When Rockstar ordered staff back to the office in 2024, the company cited security concerns as one of the reasons for calling staff back. The union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">opposed this directive at the time.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is Rockstar's next big release, and it's set to launch in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar's owner, Take-Two, will release its next earnings report today, November 6, at which time the company is expected to communicate more about GTA 6, or at least re-confirm the release date.</p><p>In addition to GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">developing PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 versions of Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.

            <p>Marks and Spencer has released its new Christmas-flavoured food ad for the year, with Dawn French taking a starring role as one of many stuck in a traffic jam on their way home for some festive fun.</p>
<p>Ok, that's very nice and all Victoria, but what has this to do with Pokémon? Eurogamer is a site about video games, after all (I mean, the clue's in the name). Well, it is because I was watching the M&amp;S trailer this morning with my coffee, and when I popped on the subtitles, I got a rather amusing surprise.</p>

<p>At one point during the trailer, Dawn holds a plate of food above the masses gathered in the back of M&amp;S's very plush food lorry, but she is a little unsure what she actually has in her hands. A fairy companion then whispers in her ear, before Dawn proclaims this is, in fact, a plate of pork and mushroom pâté by Tom Kerridge. How jolly!</p>

We would've loved to bag ourselves the solo Samus figure too, but unfortunately we're not made of money – amiibo cost a lot these days, in case you didn't notice!</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers.1345456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the firing of 30 employees last week and accusations that this was an attempt to stymie efforts by employees to unionise, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rockstar">Rockstar</a> has issued a statement that says the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a Rockstar spokesperson said, “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>


<p>All of the affected employees – with 30 to 40 people fired from across the company’s studios in the UK and Canada – were part of a private trade union chat on Discord. There were outsiders within this chat, but they were there from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) as labor organisers.</p>
<p>Following the dismissals last week, the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a> as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>
<p>Marshall has responded to Rockstar’s new allegations to say the company is&nbsp;“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritising union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Rockstar has always been a very secretive studio, something that goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of their games to make leaks of their work huge news stories. For GTA 6, the game has had two very high-profile leaking moments, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/19/rockstar-games-releases-statement-on-gta-6-leak/">a 2022 hack</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/02/gta-6-leak-rockstar-employee/">the friend of an employee’s son leaking more screens and details in 2023</a>. That latter moment was quickly followed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/rockstar-plans-full-return-to-office-for-gta-6-developers-citing-security-and-productivity/">Rockstar calling employees to return to offices for work</a>, having necessarily loosened this requirement and allowed work from home since 2020 – we all know why that was…</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to release on 26th May 2026, as Rockstar eventually decided that they needed more time, despite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs constantly stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>. But that’s been good news for 2025’s slate of releases, so where games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> had been fairly tentative about launching this year, they could launch with more confidence. That game’s knocked it out of the park, as well, no doubt helped just a little by not having to compete with GTA 6 for the average gamer’s wallet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the most controversial entries in the series to date, and the massive backlash the game received not only threw Ubisoft off, but also had an impact on the game's development.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, during a meeting of video game industry insiders held last week at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft addressed the controversy surrounding the latest entry in the series, starting with a video that recapped how the game evolved into one that everyone loved to hate. At the end, the video revealed Ubisoft's approach to the controversy: it stopped focusing on the haters. This caused the game to be delayed for additional polish, as the publisher focused on appealing to the series fan that would, in turn, defend the game in the culture war that stemmed from its controversial choices.</p>



<p><em>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,"</em> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added after the short video ended. <em>"And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</em></p>



<p>If Ubisoft indeed managed to convincingly demonstrate that Assassin's Creed Shadows is more a game than a message, it's not yet clear at this moment, as no official sales data for the game has been provided by the publisher. It definitely seems to have done well at least in Europe, as it was reported back in August that the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">latest entry in the series was the best-selling new game of 2025 in Europe</a>, beating competition like Monster Hunter Wilds and Mario Kart World.</p>



<p>Although some of the controversies that surrounded the game before launch were justified, and the choice of protagonist and historical inaccuracies can be a turn-off, Assassin's Creed: Shadows is not a bad game at all.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which google reliably informs me is a vehicle that's supposed to carry fighting infantry, rather than fight infantry itself, has had its lock-on missiles taken away for the next little bit. Some problems with countermeasures have rendered them far too effective at their job of blowing stuff up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA have confirmed the temporary switching off of these missiles in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986379990624088520">post on the hellsite</a>, putting it down to a need to "address inconsistencies witnessed with this vehicle's countermeasures". That appears to be code for countermeasures designed to prevent the likes of jets and tanks being blown to bits a bit too often and from across the map <a href="https://x.com/NerosCinema/status/1979681088399393159">not always doing their job properly</a> to have a chance of stopping the IFV's missiles in their tracks.</p>
<p>So, no missiles for now, with EA aiming to fix the problem in an update set to drop next week. In the meantime, maybe make missile lock and firing noises with your mouth whenever you spot a plane or chopper you'd like to knock out of the sky.</p> 
<p>Based on a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986043954106626391">post</a> from DICE lead producer David Sirland last night, that next patch will also include fixes for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">rooftop exploits</a> on maps like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and Empire State. These have been seeing pesky players use drones to spirit themselves up to high ground they shouldn't be able to reach, by standing atop the tech and whacking it with a sledgehammer in a fashion that weirdly remind me of the hand-cranked mine carts you get in westerns.</p><p>All of this comes as the devs continue to fiddle around with how much XP is dished out and required by certain activities, with a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">revamp of challenges and assignments</a> having arrived yesterday. "Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length," EA said of those tweaks.</p>
<p>We'll see how many of these sorts of ongoing issues and gripes end up being locked onto and wiped out by that upcoming patch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played Battlefield 6 online and willingly attempted to complete challenges, you’ve probably come across a fair few with difficult requirements—borderline impossible ones. EA and Battlefield Studios have rectified this with over 90 tweaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has countless Initiation objectives and other challenges spread across the game. This relates to Classes, specific weapons, game modes, and much more. If you’ve spent a ton of time on one or more challenges to no avail, you might finally be in luck.</p>



<h2 id="h-say-goodbye-to-annoying-battlefield-6-challenge-requirements">Say Goodbye To Annoying Battlefield 6 Challenge Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can see the light. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battlefield Comms message confirms that “A total of 90+ adjustments to Challenges and Assignments” have been made—and they are active in-game right now.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of the affected challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon. Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>



<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support. Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>



<li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest. Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives. Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This list is exhaustive, to be quite honest. Engineers will be greatly pleased to hear that the infamous Engineer Specialist 3 challenge has been reduced. Repairing 6,000 Vehicle Health in one match has been slashed to just 1,000!</p>



<p>Also, many in the community are reporting that once matches are being completed, and challenges where you’ve now met the requirements (because of the reductions) are being unlocked automatically. Now’s the perfect time to start playing BF 6, and we have the best way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">buy Battlefield 6 for cheap</a>.</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of challenges suddenly start being completed and popping up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should it have taken this long to make such adjustments? Or is it better late than never, as previous BF games might have done?

<p>Where Winds Meet has already achieved huge success in China, where it initially launched in December 2024, and is poised to make a global debut on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PC and as a console exclusive on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>



<p>Multiplayer is a huge component of modern gaming, though it isn’t always present, and we’ve got all the details on the multiplayer situation in Where Winds Meet.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-online-multiplayer">Does Where Winds Meet Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet offers various multiplayer modes, including PvP and campaign dungeons.</strong></p>



<p>The matchmaking social hub can host up to 30 players simultaneously, while campaign dungeons range in degrees of difficulty and support either five or 10 players.</p>



<p>There are also various multiplayer-only challenges spread across the map, though these are entirely optional and can be avoided.</p>



<p>In fact, all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet is entirely optional, and if you’d prefer a solely single-player adventure, there will still be over 100 hours of content to enjoy as a solo player.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-co-op">Does Where Winds Meet Have Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet supports online co-op for up to four players, while campaign dungeons raise that figure to either five or 10 players working together, depending on the difficulty of the dungeon.</strong></p>



<p>Co-op mode allows players to explore the world together, searching for historic traces, defeating bosses, solving puzzles, and participating in events.</p>



<p>All players in the session will receive rewards for first-time completion of side story or campaign tasks, while players within a certain range will receive rewards for solving puzzles.</p>



<p>There are some restrictions, however, as only certain quest items owned by the host are visible and usable, but all items will be restored to normal when you return to your own world.</p>



<p>Like all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet, co-op is optional and isn’t required, with the game offering plenty to solo players who don’t want to join up with others to tackle the world—though it can help to open a co-op lobby if you’re struggling with a specific boss.</p>

            <p>Good news: the second part of the Ark animated television show has reappeared, having once been promised for the latter part of 2024 but never materialising. The bad news: it's been officially delayed.</p>
<p>However, it's not a ridiculous wait we're facing. Part 2 of the Ark: The Animated Series will apparently air sometime in 2026, <a href="https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1986271568406946168">according to the Ark X account</a>. "Thank you for your patience," the tweet ended.</p>

<p>palaeontologist Helena Walker, who suddenly found herself - like a player in the game - awake on an island filled with dinosaurs. Not a bad set of circumstances given her profession, although, you know, with the possible danger of death. The second part of the series will continue Helena's journey as she apparently "levels-up to learn the truth", said the Ark X account. (That it's all a game?)</p><p>The TV series had a surprisingly star-studded cast, including Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh, not-a-good-singer-but-a-great-gladiator Russell Crowe, Elliott Page, Karl Urban, David Tenant and many more. I haven't seen it myself but aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes tells me the series had a middling response.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-developer-acknowledges-missing-in-action-sequel">Delays have become something of a taint for the Ark series in general</a>, the most notable being for the big game-sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, which was once promised for 2023 but then disappeared. A recently released expansion, Ark: Lost Colony - which follows Michelle Yeoh's character from the TV series - was released in June as a way to bridge the gap until the sequel reappears.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/painkiller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review.1345429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Painkiller is a series I’ve certainly heard of, but I couldn’t tell you either way whether or not I’ve played it. I must have at some point, I’m sure, because I played every single thing I could get my hands on, but I can’t actually remember doing so. What I do remember that it’s similar to Doom, including all the hellish monsters and environments. You enter a room, kill a legion of monsters, then move onto the next room, where another legion awaits your bullets. This co-op reboot of this two decade old series gets this right, at least, but it’s a bit uninspired because of this.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQjQKqzSssk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will start with the good stuff. Painkiller looks pretty good, the environments are cool in that heavy metal album cover sort of way, full of large ominous bits that trigger the imagination. The music, whilst perhaps a little on the generic side of metal background tunes, does its job of getting the blood pumping whilst you’re wading through demons well enough.</p>


<p>The best part of the game is the gunplay, gun customisation, and traversal though. There are a few guns here, though not nearly as many as you’d hope, but the two starting weapons are real highlights. The first is a stake gun, which shoots a large wooden spike and can be upgraded to pierce through enemies or shoot three stakes at a time, both of which make it incredibly satisfying to use. The second gun fires shurikens that bounce off surfaces and can be upgraded to ricochet off enemies into others nearby and is, again, incredibly enjoyable once you’ve got an upgrade.</p>
<p>The unlockable weapons include slightly more standard weapons like a shotgun, an SMG, a handcannon, and a rocket launcher, but with similar, very powerful upgrades that make them enjoyable to use. That said, after using the stake thrower with the three stakes upgrade, it felt a lot like using the shotgun once I unlocked it, and the stake thrower with the impaling upgrade feels quite a bit like the handcannon.</p>


<p>These guns also have a secondary fire which, when used on bigger enemies with proper health bars, will fill up their stun meter. Once that’s full, you can charge over and completely obliterate them with your one remaining weapon: the Painkiller. It’s effectively a chainsaw, even if it’s more of a spinning shuriken on a stick, and in addition to shredding anything that comes near it, it also generates ammo from enemies it kills. This is handy, of course, because you’re in deep trouble if you run out of ammo when one of the bigger enemies turns up. Clever use of the Painkiller, which has a cooldown for use without stunning an enemy first, and secondary fire can very quickly shred through a bigger enemy’s health bar, which is very satisfying to do.</p>
<p>As for traversal, you can’t sprint, but you can slide. Functionally this works very similarly but is faster when going down hill, slower when going up hill, and knocks enemies out of the way in a comical fashion when there’s a lot of them around. You also have a dodge button, which has two charges that each have a cooldown, that also knocks enemies out of the way. The combination of this movement system and powerful, creative weapons is a great one, making you feel truly powerful even whilst you’re desperately fighting for your life against a horde of beasties. It really can be enjoyable whilst you’re in the thick of all the chaos. One issue in traversal is grapple points not triggering when they should, or sometimes missing your enemy with the Painkiller, which is strange and can catapult you off ledges.</p>

<p>It’s a shame, really, that nothing else in the game lives up to these features. Level design is dull and generic, relying strongly on the kind of mechanics you see in an MMO, like killing enemies within a certain area, or around a barrel that collects their blood that can be shoved into a socket to progress once filled. Or perhaps that <em>totally different</em> mechanic where the barrel collects souls instead. These mechanics even turn up in boss fights, which are messy to say the least and sometimes devolve into frustration.</p>
<p>There are the most basic of basic puzzles dotted through the levels that require two people to get through occasionally – i.e. one to stand on a button and one to go through the door it opens, which usually have a cache of “loot,” if you can call it that as there’s really only four options, gold, health, ammo, and a lure that attracts enemies until they’ve depleted its health.</p>
<p>There are four characters, but beyond their designs – especially Void who seems to have a starfield for a face – and some brief dialogues between them during gameplay, they’re not particularly interesting mechanically or storywise. They each have a particular stat boost that is small enough to be nearly irrelevant, and the story here is almost non-existent. You are in purgatory for various crimes, but Metatron (the biblical voice/scribe of god) offers you a way out, by stopping the fallen angel Azazel from unleashing his demonic hordes onto Earth. You do this by fighting them across three areas, each split into three levels with a boss, and then Azazel. That’s the whole game.</p>

<p>There’s also a tarot card system that mostly seems superfluous because, whilst you’re still unlocking and upgrading your weapons, you spend the resources on doing that, and once you’re done upgrading your weapons, you’ve got little-to-no game left to use them in. The cards can give you useful bonuses such as increased health, quicker secondary fire regen, but I barely used them because they use the same resources to unlock and, once you’ve used a card once, it’s burnt and you have to restore it using the same resources. Not if you died or failed a level whilst using it, just every single time you use it.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft have reportedly offered a corporate spin on the backlash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> faced from right-wing grifters prior to release, with CEO Yves Guillemot framing it as "a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message". The company also seem to be trying to canonise the events as some kind of masterful marketing victory, which arguably isn't too surprising, even if the fact they're not trying to pretend the controversy never happened is. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, a marketing video about the backlash was shown during last week's Paris Games Week, with Guillemot subsequently making some comments further outlining how the corp - at least in terms of image they're aiming to present to industry event attendees - have chosen to interpret what happened in hindsight.</p>
<p>"We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies," the video declared. "We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks," Guillemot said afterwards, according to Game File's translation. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</p>
<p>Aside from that, which <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">mirroring what the exec said</a> at the height of the controversy, the narrative being conveyed by the presentation looks to have been that Ubisoft scored a win by smartly opting to delay the game to polish it more and running a charm offensive along the lines of 'come on folks, this is just Assassin's Creed, you all like that'.</p><p>On one hand, it's exactly how you'd expect a company to paint a their response to what was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">overwhelmingly a lot of online dickheads</a> being angry that Yasuke existed, was black, was a samurai, and was in a video game. On the other, it's sigh-inducing that this retelling seemingly left out or minimised elements like how Assassin's Creed lead Marc-Alexis Coté, who's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft</a>, actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defended his team's vision</a> for the game, in contrast to Guillemot's declaration that it was just a bit of brains-off entertainment.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-an-assassins-creed-set-in-post-civil-war-america-due-to-us-politics-and-yasuke-backlash">reported cancellation</a> of an Assassin’s Creed set in post-Civil War America back in 2024, over execs' concerns about the US' current political climate. Apparently that was one battle in which Ubisoft didn't back themselves to "fire up allies" and defeat what the marketing video reportedly called "the loudest haters".</p>

<p>Dante’s Inferno 2 was expected to be the successor to EA’s new hack-and-slash franchise at the time. For whatever reason, it never happened, and it’s been on the shelf for the last 15 years. While some bits and pieces have come out over the years, we’ve now gotten a proper look at the canceled ‘Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio’&nbsp;title.</p>



<p>Dante’s Inferno was touted as the next big hack-and-slash game to rival the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry—it also looked and played a lot like the former. We used it in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games to play like Ninja Gaiden 4 list</a>, and despite the God of War comparisons, Dante’s Inferno reviewed decently, sold respectably, before a potential Dante’s Inferno 2 disappeared off the face of the Earth…until now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-s-inferno-2-would-have-been-the-second-game-in-a-trilogy">Dante’s Inferno 2 Would Have Been The Second Game In A Trilogy</h2>

<p>The original Dante’s Inferno saw Dante—a Templar Knight—battle through horrible monsters and bosses through the Nine Circles of Hell. Its combat, nifty camera angles, puzzles, and bosses were reminiscent of God of War.</p>



<p>A full report from IGN has dug deep into history and uncovered many lost tidbits about Dante’s Inferno 2. It includes screenshots, concept drawings, and how the game’s story would unfold—as well as a third game!</p>



<p>‘<strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio</strong>‘ was the official title for the second game. IGN says it had: “A 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio.”</p>



<p>The sequel would also have shifted away from the God of War influences and looked to forge its own identity.</p>



<p>IGN’s report outlines and details every single level throughout the game, with the Seven Sins being a huge aspect, and how Dante would climb Mount Purgatory. Furthermore: “Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include <strong>co-op and multiplayer modes</strong>.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>What a ride it could’ve been. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document uncovered finds that the sequel’s conclusion would set up the events of “Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso.” You can check out more details and screenshots in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>‘s full findings.</p>

            <p>Set photos from the upcoming Resident Evil film from Weapons director Zach Cregger show a very snowy Raccoon City.</p>
<p>Filming for the adaptation kicked off earlier this year in Prague, and now thanks to <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/">The Prague Reporter</a> we can all take a little peek at what Cregger is cooking up for us all. The snow dusting the streets on the set suggests that the film will be set during the winter season in Raccoon City, a key location in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">lends credence to an earlier rumour regarding the adaptation's plot</a> (I won't spoil it here).</p>

<p>As you can see in the images below, Cregger's take on Resident Evil features an establishment called Oak Street Diner. This could be a little nod to Tall Oaks, a town in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>. One of the bus signs also points to Central Station, which pops up in the games.</p>
<p>"In the Karlín neighborhood of Prague 8, an action scene involving snow, gunfire, explosions, and fast driving was filmed from Oct. 29-Nov. 2," the publication wrote. "Residents and visitors passing through the area were greeted with a light cover of snow throughout the week as production on Resident Evil took place primarily during the night hours."</p>

</figure>
<p>Cregger previously confirmed his take on the Resident Evil film will tell an original story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">but will still be "true to the experience of the games"</a>. At this time, he added the film "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3. That being said, Cregger said his adaptation "adheres more to the tone of 4". The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">filmmaker has not seen any of the previous Resident Evil film adaptations himself</a>.</p>
<p>Cregger - whose other work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/DAVE-THE-DIVER-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2957273.html">eShop listing</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition offers "higher resolution and improved frame rates", while the content of the game remains unchanged between the consoles. Dave's diving escapades didn't feel like they <em>needed</em> a boost in this department, but smoother swimming is always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>Those with Dave the Diver on Switch 1 can upgrade to this new version for free. Alternatively, you can pick up the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> (a discount on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> brings that down to $11.99 until 13th November).</p>
<p>Developer Mintrocket teased that the update would be coming "soon" back in June, so it's nice to see that promise finally materialise.</p>
<p>We awarded Dave the Diver an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dave-the-diver">our review</a>, calling it one of the few 2023 games "that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". If you still haven't dived in, now might be a good excuse to do so.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the biggest and most anticipated releases on the horizon in 2025, and we’ve got all the details on when you can preload the game to jump into the action.</p>



<p>After achieving vast success in China, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases globally on November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and PlayStation 5</a> as a console exclusive title, with millions of players already pre-registering for the game.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to preload Where Winds Meet in advance so you can dive straight into the game on launch, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-where-winds-meet">When Can You Preload Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nearly there. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available from November 12 at 2 PM PT, NetEase has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</strong></p>



<p>This gives you plenty of time to download Where Winds Meet in advance for launch, and preloading is recommended due to the large file size and the fact that servers will likely be stretched by an influx of players the moment the game goes live.</p>



<p>The table below shows when preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Preload Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Nov. 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-file-size-explained">Where Winds Meet File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Exact file sizes for Where Winds Meet depend on your platform, with PC users having several options to download, while PlayStation 5 has a single version.</strong></p>



<p>Users on PC have three different versions to choose from, with the Lite version clocking in at 68 GB, the Standard version requiring around 100 GB of space, and the Ultimate version requiring 120 GB—though the Ultimate version of the game may not be available immediately.</p>



<p>For PlayStation 5 players, the download size is around 108 GB total, and there are no other options for the download. </p>



<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are subject to change and could increase with day-one patches.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-where-winds-meet">How to Preload Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload Where Winds Meet, you can do so by visiting your platform store once the preload has been made available.</strong></p>



<p>On Steam, simply search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the store and find the preload option, which is available without needing to spend any additional cash due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title’s free-to-play status</a>.</p>



<p>The approach on PlayStation 5 is similar, requiring you to search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the PS Store, though make sure you click the right version, as there is a paid-for pre-order edition that provides additional rewards. If you just want the free-to-play version, make sure you select it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has said he’d feel more sad to learn Red Dead Redemption 3 was in development without him than he feels about GTA 6, but admits the game “will probably happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2018 epic western <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is considered a masterpiece and one of the greatest video games of all time. Houser was lead writer on it, as he was for almost all Rockstar’s games. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta">having left the company over five years ago</a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar">GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=kMAZuzpS5Xxkb3mm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Houser has indicated that he’d have stronger feelings when Rockstar inevitably returns to Red Dead Redemption with a follow-up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20 odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Red Dead Redemption 3 an inevitability? Houser seems to think the Red Dead Redemption series will continue, but it’s worth noting that the series began with Red Dead Revolver in 2004, so perhaps Rockstar will create a new sub-series if and when it decides the time is right for more Red Dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, in 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the focus very much is on GTA 6, due out May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>The smartphone in your pocket can be a surprisingly versatile gaming device, but admittedly, touchscreen controls aren't the best. Fortunately, there's a wide range of accessories that you can equip to your phone, <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and this new magnetic case from MCon</a> looks like it'll hit the Goldilocks zone for functionality and compact design. Now available to preorder for $145 (was $150), the MCon is designed to fit "most" phones using its magnetic clamps.</p><div title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4894" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">$145 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>In addition to being a pocket-friendly device, the MCon features some high-end technology inside it. It has deployable grips for ergonomic comfort, Hall-Effect analog triggers, GameSir anti-stick drift joysticks, and a built-in gyroscope for motion controls. Another cool feature with this controller is that it has a button-activated slider that raises your phone into playing position with a single smooth motion. Kickback Mode allows you to remove the control cover and prop your phone up for tabletop play.</p><p>The controller also supports games that are played in Portrait Mode, and it features all the inputs you'd expect for modern-day gaming. The device also has silent face buttons, and it attaches to your phone with two magnetic pucks to keep your camera bumps away from the controller, ensuring a level fit. When not in use, the MCon measures just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, to make it easy to store in your pocket. It's available to preorder in white or black.</p></div>                      </div><p>The MCon was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign that blew past its initial funding goal of $25,000, earning over $1.7 million in crowdfunding. Part of the appeal for the device is that it has a user-friendly design, as manufacturer Oh Snap designed it to be moddable, upgradeable, and repairable. Smartphone controllers have become popular over the last couple of years, thanks in part to subscription services like Netflix and Crunchyroll offering a library of games for members to access, and there are several brands out there that offer high-quality add-ons like this.</p><p>One of the biggest is Backbone, as it currently sells controllers that are also portable and make mobile gaming a more pleasant experience. The company recently announced a collaboration with Hideo Kojima's studio to produce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-new-death-stranding-2-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-from-the-games-world/1100-6535766/" data-ref-id="1100-6535766">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Backbone controller</a>, but if you're in a rush, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One with a USB-C connection</a> is available for $100, and for older iPhones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Backbone One with a Lightning connection</a> is available at the same price.</p><p>The Backbone Ones have a solid design, but if you're looking for a more premium controller with better parts inside, the company's premium smartphone controller--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>--is worth considering, with Hall Effect triggers, quiet face buttons, and full-sized ALPS analog sticks.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6’s challenges just got a lot easier to do]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/battlefield-6s-challenges-just-got-a-lot-easier-to-do/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-challenges-just-got-a-lot-easier-to-do.1345393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have made a set of sweeping changes to the in-game Challenges and Assignments in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, making them much easier to complete, which should be music to the ears of time-starved fans of the game.</p>
<p>When they made changes to the XP earned and reduced ranking requirements shortly after launch, they also stated that they would be addressing complaints over some of the overly lengthy requirements for Challenges and Assignments, which many players felt were overly burdensome.</p>


<p>The first set of changes have now gone live with a sever-side update, and are retroactive to progress already made. This are applied the first time you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet. This is great news, but doesn’t necessarily fix some of the inconsistencies in the core gameplay and tracking itself. Things like getting suppression on enemies were horrible for Support class players not just because of the huge numbers required to succeed, but because they weren’t registering properly – also, it’s not clear what suppression really does, as it definitely doesn’t affect sniper aim!</p>
<p>But this is still a positive step for the game’s regular progression, letting it get out of the way of the new grind of battle pass missions and more. Now, if only there was a way to just rule out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">battle royale mode</a> quests, that would be nice, because I’m maybe never going to play that…</p>
<p>The team highlighted the following examples:</p>

<p><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assault 2:</strong> Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p>
<p>All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p>
<p>The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conquest 2:</strong> Wins in Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conquest 3:</strong> Objective kills in a round of Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p>
<p>General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li>
</ul>

<p>"They're just speaking the language of video games"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Dan Houser, former GTA boss and co-founder of Rockstar Games, recently took to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTU7xLbSrw">Lex Fridman Podcast</a> to talk about his personal history and the games industry at large (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/former-gta-boss-dan-houser-says-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-or-the-kingdom-are-like-alfred-hitchcock-films-theyre-just-speaking-the-language-of-video-games/">Games Radar+</a>).</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned to Nintendo when the pair began to speak about early 3D games. Fridman notes that Nintendo has a particular level of polish in which "every pixel has a purpose", with the company expertly "delivering a pure gaming experience".</p>
<p>Houser agreed, and when they got onto the more recent open-world Zelda entries – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> – he states that they "feel like [Alfred] Hitchcock" in their design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The new ones, they almost, to me, feel like Hitchcock. They're just speaking the language of video games. You know, like, you know everything's going to work this way and that way – it's quite systemic, but how it all glues together is so amazing.</p>
<p>"It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality, he's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong accent. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.</p>
<p>"And that's what those Zelda games kinda feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a pretty apt comparison to us! Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have certainly earned their fair share of praise over the years, but this might be the first time we've heard them compared to Hitchcock – it certainly makes sense, though.</p>
<p>Dan Houser is, of course, no longer at Rockstar Games, which itself is gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in 2026. Houser went on to form Absurd Ventures with an aim to create new IP across video games, books, movies, comics, and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-game-director-denies-console-rumors-%E2%80%98we-would-just-say-it%E2%80%99.1345387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Throughout its 21 years on the market, World of Warcraft has often been subject to rumors that it would be ported to consoles. A couple of years ago, for the first time, franchise VP Holly Longdale <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-on-consoles-is-still-a-possibility-of-course-we-talk-about-it-were-microsoft-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> they had been talking to Microsoft about the possibility following the former company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>However, World of Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas has now denied fan theories that some of the accessibility changes coming with the next expansion, Midnight, are geared toward eventually porting the MMORPG to consoles. Answering a question from Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Unshackled Fury podcast</a>, Hazzikostas said:</p>



<p><em>It is not. To be fully transparent, there's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing World of Warcraft to consoles or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying: 'We're actively working towards it. We know we have a lot of work to do, but it's a place where we want to land.' Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience. I think a lot of these changes, as a package, are about approachability broadly. World of Warcraft is an incredibly complex game. I know there's members of the community who celebrate that complexity, but I think there's a big difference between having a very high skill ceiling in a game, having a tremendous amount of depth, and just having complexity. I think our goal has always been, Blizzard's goals have always been, with all of our games, to have them be easy to learn and nearly impossible to master. And I think a lot of our changes in World of Warcraft Midnight are aimed at improving the easy to learn side of that spectrum.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I have played a little of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Midnight Alpha</a>, and the game is still far from being accessible enough to be playable with a gamepad. There are still way too many skills and buttons to press compared to games like Final Fantasy XIV and The Elder Scrolls Online, which were designed from the get-go to be available on consoles. Personally, I believe a truly massive rework would be required to make it truly playable on consoles, and I don't think the studio is entirely sure it would be worth the effort. As such, I doubt it will ever happen.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight doesn't have a release date yet, but a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> it could launch in February 2026. In other Blizzard news, early bird tickets for BlizzCon 2026 <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will go on sale tomorrow</a>. </p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is whistling onto the scene, and there are a bunch of pre-registration rewards available to earn to begin your journey. We’ve got all the details on the rewards and how they are claimed within the title.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Where Winds Meet has achieved vast success in China, where it initially released on PC in December 2024, and is now launching globally on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and as a PlayStation 5 console exclusive</a>.</p>



<p>Pre-registration rewards in Where Winds Meet are available to players on both platforms, and we’ve got the full breakdown on everything there is to claim.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-where-winds-meet-pre-registration-rewards">All Where Winds Meet Pre-Registration Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pre-registration rewards for Where Winds Meet are unlocked as a community goal, with each stage of rewards requiring a total number of pre-registrations to be secured.</strong></p>



<p>At the time of writing, all but one of the pre-registration rewards have been unlocked, with four rewards available for players. However, the final reward, the Swaying Lotus Skin, is yet to be unlocked and requires a total of 10 million pre-registrations to be distributed to players.</p>



<p>The rewards available for pre-registration are cosmetic or currency-related, though the first two have not been detailed fully and are merely indicated as ‘gifts’ for now.</p>



<p>All the pre-registration rewards available for Where Winds Meet are detailed in the table below, along with their community goal requirements.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-pre-registration-rewards-in-where-winds-meet">How to Claim Pre-Registration Rewards in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>All redeemable rewards in Where Winds Meet are not automatically added to your inventory and must be claimed manually using the in-game Letter system.</strong></p>



<p>The Letters feature is accessible from the main menu within the game as an option to select on the right-hand side of the same screen where you can change your gear and skills, view quests, and change appearance.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on your Letters in-game, too, as there will be a bunch of rewards to claim throughout your progression in the game.</p>

            <p>Bad Brain Game Studios, founded by former Ubisoft developers including those who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>, will be shutting down on the 17th November. The studio has been unable to acquire necessary funding after Netease pulled the plug.</p>
<p>A sizzle reel for Bad Brain's upcoming game Midnight Riders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">was uploaded to the company's LinkedIn page</a>, alongside a statement from the studio about the closure as well as an emphasis that the IP remains available for "acquisition or partnership".</p>
<p>The statement reads: "Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent."</p>

<p>It continues: "The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you."</p><p>This marks the latest in a long string of studio woes as a direct result of Netease's withdrawal from Western game development. It was only last month that Fantastic Pixel Castle announced it'll shut down for the same reason, as did T-Minus Zero back in September.</p>
<p>According to Bad Brain Game Studios' LinkedIn page, the company employs between 11-50 employees, all of which will be out of work during an especially treacherous period in the video game industry.</p>

		<p>November is The Simpsons month in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with a big collaboration and cross-over event that includes animated shorts, a whole new island, cel shaded graphics and a whole host of beloved The Simpsons characters to play as. That’s proven to be pretty darned popular, with Epic touting a big batch of new and returning players, to an extent not seen since last year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Welcome to Springfield - Fortnite | The Simpsons" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqQDlH9ztL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on <a href="https://xcancel.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624">social media</a>, Epic confirmed that “In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning Fortnite players since last holiday season. The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ Today in the US. Move over Shelbyville…”</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20251105">fortnite.gg</a> that amounts to a peak of almost 2.7 million concurrent players, though this figure needs a good bit of context. For one thing, the all-time peak player count is the 14.34 million that turned up for the Fortnite Remix: The Finale live event to close out Chapter 2 Remix on 30th November 2024. It also doesn’t mean the highest player counts of this year, which came close to 6 million in June and have had peaks for other events. Noting that it’s “new and returning” players means that it’s lapsed gamers, as opposed to those that will regularly drop in for a game or two. The real impact needs to be for the</p>
<p>Fortnite’s cel-shaded event has brought with it a month of Simpsons related content. The headline act is the 80-player Springfield Island, which is a “back-to-basics” battle royale experience, with each week bringing new themed gameplay, shop offerings and more. There’s tons of hidden easter eggs and gags in the game to find, including three bosses to find and battle.</p>

<p>Tying in with that are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games and streaming on Disney+ and on Fortnite social channels. The first short immediately jumped to the top of Disney+ charts, with a new short coming every Monday from 10th November, leading into new gameplay on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>These episodes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – “Apocalypse D’Oh”</li>
<li>November 10 – “Sugar High”</li>
<li>November 17 – “Multiplidiocy”</li>
<li>November 24 – “The Incredible Bulk”</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of the Kingdom Come: Deliverance games has reviewed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and in doing so has issued a number of stinging criticisms of Obsidian’s sci-fi RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daniel Vavra, co-founder of Warhorse Studios and lead writer of the much-loved RPGs Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1985848222707765440" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say he’d finished The Outer Worlds 2 and settled on a 7/10 review score (check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2 review</a> to find out what we thought).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a decent score for any video game, but expanding his thoughts, Vavra criticized The Outer Worlds 2 and Microsoft-owned developer, Obsidian Entertainment, for fasiling to innovate in the RPG space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the review in full:</p><blockquote>Finished. 7/10. But what I find sad is that the company and the people who gave us one of my favorite games ever (Fallout &amp; New Vegas) have been unable, even after 15 years and with all of Microsoft's money and latest technological advances, to come up with a single new game mechanic that could take this proven but ancient formula somewhere new.  Can any of you think of a single new game mechanic in The Outer Worlds that wasn't already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago? Unfortunately, I can't. Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens and level grinding in a static scripted world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth unpacking Vavra’s comment. His first point is an accusation that Obsidian, creator of the beloved Fallout: New Vegas, has failed to significantly evolve its "ancient formula," despite the backing of moneybags Microsoft. He claims The Outer Worlds (I assume he means The Outer Worlds 2 here) doesn’t have a single new game mechanic that wasn’t already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is that true? Some people are pointing to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-outer-worlds-2/All_Flaws">The Outer Worlds 2’s Flaw system</a>, which sees the game dish out game-changing perks that can benefit your character but always hinder them in some way, as an eye-catching new feature for this type of RPG. In a later social media post, Vavra said Fallout had Traits with negative aspects, calling this Flaw system “nothing new.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that fair? The Outer Worlds 2’s Flaw system is getting a lot of love from players not just for their impact on playstyle, but the way they’re unlocked. As you play the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-outer-worlds-2/Best_Flaws_to_Pick_and_Reject">you’ll occasionally trigger a Flaw opportunity</a>, with the game itself reacting to the way you’re playing by delivering some really fun perks that are a delight to encounter. For example, if you crouch walk a lot you’ll be offered the Bad Knees Flaw, which makes you crouch walk faster but every time you stand up your knees crack, making a noise guards might hear. I won’t spoil all the Flaws here because part of the fun is in their discovery, but I will say it feels like there is a DM behind the scenes, observing your playstyle and occasionally dipping into the action to add some spice to your experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are pointing to the way Obsidian lets players unlock unique dialogue options not just by having a high speech skill, but by seeking out information which can then be brought into conversations to gain an advantage. Your character will remember "discovered info” you’ve found from, say, terminals or chats with other NPCs or examining things, and you’ll get the chance to use it in conversation when it counts. It’s a cool system that adds depth to the standard, straight-forward speech-driven dialogue experience you see in a lot of RPGs, and it makes you want to go out into the world and learn more before having the big quest convos, like the space detective I like role-playing as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vavra continues: “Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens and level grinding in a static scripted world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Vavra’s assessment of The Outer Worlds 2 perhaps rings true. The game’s mini-open worlds can feel static and scripted in the sense that they do not revolve around a simulation. The Outer Worlds 2 is not a game similar in scope or style to one of Bethesda’s big RPGs. It is not Fallout: New Vegas, even, more a game that rekindles memories of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And scope is something Obsidian openly talks about. It is one of the most prolific studios Microsoft has, having released three new games this year alone: Avowed, Grounded 2, and The Outer Worlds 2. It is a developer that has learnt to focus when it comes to scope, to drill down, and to ship games that are manageable to play and, I suspect, manageable to develop. Obsidian isn’t doing a The Elder Scrolls 6 here. It’s carved out a style all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So The Outer Worlds 2 was never going to be a game with a living, simulated world. Whether that disappoints you or not probably comes down to your expectations for modern Obsidian games. But I’d say it was pretty obvious what The Outer Worlds 2 was going to be, not just based on previews, but on the studio’s previous games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Vavra’s “all of Microsoft’s money” comment? Sure, Microsoft has significant resources, but the business reality is — reportedly — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-has-reportedly-pushed-xbox-studios-to-deliver-a-30-profit-margin-allegedly-leading-to-all-those-layoffs-canceled-projects-price-rises-and-the-end-of-exclusives">that Xbox studios are under more pressure to deliver profits</a>. Part of doing that will be bringing more money in while keeping development as low as possible. It does not feel like Xbox studios have a magic money tap to make their dream games come true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vavra’s comments have certainly hit a nerve online, and have sparked a debate about what Obsidian is trying to do when it comes to video game development. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-knows-whenever-it-announces-a-new-game-everyone-asks-about-fallout-new-vegas-2-but-it-loves-making-original-ip-and-sequels-to-them">It recently acknowledged that fans desperately want it to make Fallout: New Vegas 2</a>, a game that would probably come with the kind of expectations Vavra has for the studio, but it’s enjoying creating new IP and building those franchises out with sequels, which is what The Outer Worlds 2 is all about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be clear by now that Obsidian’s focus is on actually releasing games that are consistently good and don’t necessarily need to be huge hits to be successful. In the current climate, perhaps that’s an approach that makes a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
