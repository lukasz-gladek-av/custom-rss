<p>The struggle of hero-shooter Concord continues as the game is officially out, and no one seems to care. In its first few hours available worldwide, Concord has yet to surpass even 1,000 players on Steam since launch.</p>



<p>As of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">less than 700 players</a> are actively playing the online PvP title.</p>



<p>To be honest, this shouldn’t be too surprising based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-concord-open-beta-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor open beta numbers</a> when no one had to pay to access the game. Now that you have to spend the full $40 to play, it’s hard to see it becoming a hit out of nowhere.</p>



<p>Obviously the numbers should go up over the weekend as more people have time to play the game. But it’s unlikely we’ll see them go up to a point where both Sony and Firewalk Studios are happy with the numbers. As far as PlayStation 5 player numbers, that information isn’t publicly available. It could be assumed, however, that numbers on the console would be higher than PC. How much higher, though, is unclear.</p>



<p>With all that said, Firewalk seems set to support Concord — a game that has been <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development for eight years</a> — at least through the winter. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-post-launch-roadmap-outlines-new-characters-maps-and-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two seasons</a> have already been announced as coming in October and January. There’s also a tease for a third season in April. But beyond that, questions are going to continue about the viability of the game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans seemed to be turned off by</a> right from the start.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-backtracks-on-fan-content-policy-reinstates-older-community-use-policy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in July, Paizo Inc. replaced their <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sid6?Update-from-Paizo-President-Jim-Butler">Community Use</a> policy with a new Fan Content policy. This was a controversial move since it drastically altered and restricted what players and creators could do with fan-created <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> material. Paizo is now taking steps to walking back this policy, including reinstating the original Community Use Policy.</p>
<h2>The Paizo Fan Content Walk Back</h2>
<p>In an official <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan">blog post</a>, Paizo announced they would be making changes to their Fan Content policy while reinstating their original Community Use Policy. In addition, updates and clarifications will be implemented, making the policies easier to parse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-2e-ice-mountain-artwork.jpg?itok=BscKfJnF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-2e-ice-mountain-artwork.jpg?itok=JNj3exDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those unaware, Paizo's original Community Use policy was in place for over 15 years. In broad terms it allowed players to create original content for <em>Pathfinder</em> and <em>Starfinder</em>. The only catch was you couldn't charge for access. This was a boon for fan projects since it permitted the use of named characters and locations.</p>
<p>A version of this policy was also in effect for different <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-announces-pathfinder-second-edition-remaster-project" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2e</em></a> materials. This included Foundry VTT support</p>
<p>With Paizo shifting to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-creator-paizo-releases-first-draft-of-open-rpg-creative-license-asking-for" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORC license</a>, the company implemented their Fan Content policy. This was a more restrictive policy since it required creators to remove setting specific characters and terms to comply with the ORC and limited the publishing of work to approved platforms like Roll20 or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-infinite-coming-to-roll20" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Infinite</em></a>.</p>
<p>The post further details the policy changes coming with the Fan Content and Community Use policies. First, the Approved Products List and Community Use Registry have been removed. For the latter, you must include contact information on your product.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-rise-of-the-rune-lords-artwork.jpg?itok=xzTyUwgV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-rise-of-the-rune-lords-artwork.jpg?itok=dIUZ9r77 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With these changes, fans can still monetize their creations through the Fan Content policy, just with the freedoms permitted under the Community Use policy. Paizo has confirmed they will be refining these policies to clearly define what commercial uses of their products are allowed.</p>
<p>The post concludes with Paizo apologizing to the community for their misstep with these policies, promising to inform the community as soon as these revised policies go into effect.</p>

                <p>Researchers discovered that the polymer material hydrogel can play and improve its gameplay experience by playing the prolific video game Pong.</p><p>As reported in the findings from the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/08/240822125903.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cell Press journal</a>, scientists were able to hook up non-living hydrogels with electrical stimulation in a virtual video game environment. This then allowed the non-living hydrogel to improve its gameplay by up to 10% with practice and was even able to create longer rallies between the paddles alongside an increased hit rate. It took 20 minutes for the hydrogel to reach its maximum "Pong potential," the journal states.</p><p>"We showed that hydrogels are not only able to play Pong; they can actually get better at it over time," said first author and robotics engineer Vincent Strong from the University of Reading.</p><p>More research is still needed, but the researchers said that this showcases the ability of non-living materials--hydrogel in this case--to use memory to update the hydrogel's understanding of its immediate environment.</p><p>This latest study and research were inspired by the testing from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/13/scientists-teach-brain-cells-to-play-virtual-pong" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few years ago on a dish of brain cells that were taught to play Pong</a>.</p>

The game is playable for the first time to the public, and the amount of information coming out of just that preview build is insane. We’ve learned a <em>lot </em>just from three days of developer interviews and fans collating all the info they’ve gleaned from the demo, and here’s just some of the biggest things we’ve spotted over the past week. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-recommend-id="image://109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-recommend-id="image://109b72969ab1299e0392af3a35637068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the new 3D map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you might expect, a new <em>Monster Hunter </em>game is bound to pack in a bunch of quality-of-life changes that series veterans and newcomers alike will appreciate. One of the biggest tweaks comes to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ map, which is now 3D. In the past, maps have been flat while trying to communicate the sheer density of the different biomes, which made them a bit of a confusing mess for players who weren’t already familiar with the layouts of the areas. Now, it should be <em>much </em>easier to maneuver across <em>Wilds</em>’ huge new environments.</p><p>When you’re in a big fight, you’re typically picking at weak points in the hope of crippling the monster’s movement or abilities and getting monster parts, which used to break off and appear as shiny bits you needed to manually collect. That no longer seems to be entirely the case, and now when you break parts of the monster, you’ll automatically pick up smaller pieces, meaning you don’t have to scramble in or out of combat to get every last scrap now. You’ll still need to carve bigger pieces, like tails, and dead monsters can now be climbed on in order to harvest them. And hey, if you’re hurting after a fight or on your way to another one and don’t want to choose between your different potions, there’s now a dynamic healing option that’ll pick the best fit based on your health.</p><p>Funnily enough, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive barrels</a></span> (which used to be static) can now be picked up and thrown at enemies, and potentially even teammates. There’s a million little changes like this that should make dealing with all the nuts-and-bolts stuff outside of monster-killing simpler and more approachable than in its predecessors. Oh, and as a fun aside that I’ll also chalk up to “quality-of-life changes,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ext4ve/barrel_bombs_can_now_be_picked_up_after_being/#:~:text=Xanek-,Barrel%20bombs%20can%20now%20be%20picked%20up%20after%20being%20placed,thrown%20to%20roll%20into%20monsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explosive barrels</a></span> (which used to be static) can now be picked up and thrown at enemies, and potentially even teammates.

If you’re playing the game in single-player mode, you can now pause, which hasn’t been available for a while, and you can even skip the quest-end timer in solo play and multiplayer, assuming everyone agrees to skip it. Finishing a hunt will no longer kick you back to camp either, and on that note, you can also pick up quests in the field dynamically. Just running across a monster can trigger its hunt, so you no longer have to initiate missions from the village.</p><p>It also appears that you can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lovebreaddd/status/1826281126283157682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lovebreaddd/status/1826281126283157682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dodge out of certain moves</a></span> or sheathe your weapon mid-animation, which is going to save people tons of time and hardship. Previously, <em>Monster Hunter </em>players have had to simply commit to the animation of whatever attack they unleashed, whether it connected or not, which <em>could </em>open them up to attacks from the massive monsters that they’re charged with hunting. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-recommend-id="image://89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-recommend-id="image://89c69ec7add1d701822a12e0ca9cbe63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing multiplayer gameplay from Gamescom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>games have always been big on multiplayer, typically allowing squads of up to four players (as well as smaller AI companions) to take on hunts and synergize their loadouts to maximize the results of the missions. In a drastic change, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>now features AI hunters that can support the player in hunts if desired. SOS flares can now be customized to only summon NPCs or players depending on what you want, but by default they will populate the game with NPCs if you can’t find a party to play with. </p></div><div><p>One of the smaller but still significant features to return in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>is the ability to swim underwater. Though it has existed in previous games and underwater combat was included in <em>Monster Hunter 3 </em>and <em>3 Ultimate</em>, water sections have largely been MIA for the last several installments due to the polarizing reception to them in the past. Though <em>Wilds </em>doesn’t have underwater combat, the team seems to be testing the waters (so to speak) by implementing underwater areas again at all, which has some fans hoping that DLC may eventually bring the full feature back. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-recommend-id="image://28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-recommend-id="image://28f25574e6cd3effbde039ec1b94924b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing a hunter with the insect glaive weapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I used to think that the Insect Glaive, one of <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s more ludicrous and complex weapons, was a very niche loadout, but turns out a lot of people love it and especially appreciate the air acrobatics it allowed players to do. That no longer seems to be the case in <em>Wilds</em>, which appears to have nerfed the bounce that players would get off of a mid-air slashing combo. The thing effectively let you stay in the air forever, and while it looked quite silly, it was also great at making the class visually distinct from others, which are largely terrestrial. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-recommend-id="image://773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-recommend-id="image://773b3bdd85a1082af53fbff216a5407f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Monster Hunter Wilds showing the armor and equipment screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a win for truly everyone, armor is no longer gender-locked in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds. </em>This has never been the case before, and has meant that sometimes a player couldn’t get armor they really wanted because they locked themselves in when choosing their character’s gender as they were customizing them. Now, you can slap on whatever you want.

Think of a weapon in these games as the equivalent of a fighting game character, complete with their own moveset, unique combos, and latent abilities. Not only are most of them getting tweaked or reworked in some way, but now Capcom is adding perfect-timing mechanics to a slew of them, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-recommend-id="image://46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-recommend-id="image://46f778e49cd3ef97782fb53fa7add01b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a trailer showing the player and their mount dodging an incoming attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>features dynamic weather effects called Inclemencies that roll through the biomes and drastically change the nature of the arena. The most common one we’ve seen through trailers and previews is a mixture of a sandstorm and thunderstorm, and these will affect monsters and hunters alike. However, even outside of these effects, aspects of the environment can set you up for failure. On one of the developer streams out of Gamescom, the players lured one monster to a sand dune that caused the monster to trip over itself more easily, making it vulnerable to more attacks from the hunters. Another creature that could crawl on surfaces that players couldn’t reach could be toppled and stunned by using the hunter’s slinger (and specifically the grapple ability on it) to bring the column it was climbing on down.</p></div><div><p>In case you haven’t realized, there’s a lot to cover that’s new in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. For example, you will be able to cook meals that account for changes in the climate, such as whipping up foodthat negates the effects of cold or hot weather. Mounting monsters in this game is also pretty similar to how it functioned in <em>Monster Hunter World </em>and you now have more moves when you’re riding a creature. Alongside the basic dagger plunge, you can now do a heavy attack and a signature finisher based on your weapon. </p><p>That isn’t all either. Large dung pods can be used to disperse herds of monsters, which is going to be especially helpful since <em>Wilds </em>seems to be going in on monsters that have swarms of little minions. There are also now up-close Power Clash moments, such as perfect guarding with a shield which results in a quick-time event where you beat back the monster. When a monster is going to unleash a particularly nasty attack, your life bar will also flash quite dramatically to warn you to guard or dodge out of the way. There’s literally too many cool polishes and changes to count. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At the time I'm writing this, I've put about seven hours into World of Warcraft: The War Within – basically every moment between when it unlocked and when I could no longer keep my eyes open. And that's very early to say anything definitive. But… I have a very good feeling about this one, you guys. From the story, to the environments, to the new features, this is World of Warcraft firing on all cylinders. I'm not utterly blown away or anything that hyperbolic, but compared to the last three expansions' launches, the warm glow of new adventure is hitting different this time.</p><p>I've been taking my sweet time – relatively speaking – so while <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/incredible-world-first-level-80-in-the-war-within-completed-already/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some bedlamites</a> had already hit 80 inside of a couple hours, I logged off for the night at level 73. That pace allowed me to collect three of my new Hero Talents for my Marksmanship Hunter, and I chose to go with the night elf-themed Sentinel over the tortured soul, Sylvanas-inspired Dark Ranger. I'm not super thrilled with these talents yet; we'll see how it feels at 80, but I'm not getting the sense of a significant change in my power or my playstyle with each level like I'd hoped. </p><p>I do like that The War Within doesn't add a bunch of new buttons to my hotbar, though. Part of why I picked Sentinel over Dark Ranger is that the latter makes you incorporate a new attack into your rotation, and I like that I have the option not to have to worry about that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN World of Warcraft Review</h3></div></output><h2><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></h2><p>If you missed the big announcement last BlizzCon, The War Within is intended as the first part of a trilogy of expansions that aim to tell a larger, complete story. This is something WoW has never done before, and I'm pretty excited about it. Without spoiling too much, the first hour of the story definitely feels like we're going full speed ahead into something sweeping and epic. Some major sacred cows in the lore are actually on the chopping block (not literally – Baine is fine, don't worry). And Xal'atath is a compelling new nemesis – not just because she's a hot goth mommy.</p><p>I mean, it's partly that. But it's not <em>just</em> that.</p><p>I've only seen the first of The War Within's zones, the verdant and picturesque Isle of Dorn, which exists on the surface just above where the other 80 percent takes place. It feels very familiar to a long-time WoW player in a lot of the same ways the Dragon Isles did, and basically all of the best features from Dragonflight are back. You get Dynamic Flying (what used to be called Dragonriding) almost immediately, which I'm still conflicted about just because I think exploring new zones for the first time on the ground gives you more of a sense of place and grandeur. But I'm not conflicted at all about the return of thrilling aerial race courses and the expanded profession system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Isle of Dorn has some of my favorite music since Wrath of the Lich King.</p></div><p>Dornogal, the capital of the Earthen who protect Azeroth's depths, is one of the coolest hub cities we've ever gotten thanks to its majestic Titan architecture and an interesting political storyline to unravel. It's also quite a bit more organized and easier to navigate than the sometimes disorienting vertical layout of Valdrakken.</p><p>And the music! I can easily say the Isle of Dorn has some of my favorite music in WoW since, dang, Wrath of the Lich King maybe? Since Blizzard’s composers always kill it with their orchestral excellence, it's really something when they release this many tracks that stand out even by their high standards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>The Long Road Ahead</strong></h2><p>Just like Dragonflight, the smaller zone quests are often memorable and touching. I think the one everybody's going to be talking about this time involves one of the semi-immortal Earthen realizing that his mind is starting to deteriorate, and asking you to help him set his affairs in order as he plans to end his own life in the traditional fashion of his people. I never get tired of being reminded that, for all the world-shaking, high-fantasy shenanigans driving World of Warcraft at the plot level, these kinds of heartfelt and relatable tales are what actually make it special.</p><p>I'm also quite optimistic about Delves, the new solo content that's meant to be something of an alternative to raids and Mythic+ in the endgame, for people like me who don't like to interact with randos and don't have any friends left who still play this game from the group I started out with in 2004. They feature the same kinds of silly and ridiculous temporary power-ups I adored from Torghast, including one that gives you a double jump and another that greatly increases your damage as long as you never fall below half health. If Torghast has only one fan, it is me. If Torghast has no fans, then I am gone from this Earth. So it's great to see some of the things that worked about it coming back.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len Ranks All the WoW Expansions</h3><p>Every WoW expansion ranked best to worst. Dragonflight is not included since we won't really know for a couple years where it falls.</p></div><p>One delve I played has what are effectively the jump mushrooms from Sonic the Hedgehog, allowing you to explore vertically in a new way, and another features wall-mounted ledges you can zip up to with a grappling hook. The only thing hurting my excitement about these is that they seem really, really short so far – less than 15 minutes in some cases. Part of it is that I haven't unlocked the higher difficulties yet, so I can basically Arcane Shot-spam my way through the entire thing without looking at my health bar. And I've only seen the first three. But I was hoping for something closer to the length of a five-person dungeon experience.</p><p>There's way, way more of The War Within I haven't seen at this point than what I have, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself so far, and that’s just about the highest praise one can give an expansion at launch. Check back next week for the first big update on my progress, and for a final verdict some time after Season 1 and the first raid unlock on September 10.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong has now sold a whopping 10 million copies, in just a matter of three days, reveals developer Game Science in a tweet at X.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is pushing the accelerator when it comes to the popularity of the title amongst fans worldwide since the game has managed to break records, especially in terms of concurrent players. Recently, we reported on how Black Myth: Wukong <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/">managed to achieve 2.3 million players on Steam</a>, surpassing the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring, and now, according to the developers of the game themselves, Black Myth: Wukong has now achieved 10 million in sales, which is a massive achievement, probably one of for the history books.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the game has achieved three million players across all platforms, including consoles. If we do some maths here, it becomes evident that a gigantic portion of around 2.3 million players is from those on PC, notably Steam, while the rest of 700,000 users are from other platforms. This is mainly due to the hype of the title in China, which is why the PC platform accounts for the larger share of users.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong has sold 10 million copies across all platforms.<br>(Data as of 21:00 Beijing time, August 23, 2024)</p>
<p>Thanks to all players worldwide for your support and love.<br>Have a great gaming weekend!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a> <a href="https://t.co/mp3mk9JxrX">pic.twitter.com/mp3mk9JxrX</a></p>
<p>— Black Myth: Wukong (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While sentiments about Black Myth: Wukong are mixed amongst the audience, it's safe to say that the title has made an impact on the industry, and Game Science, the developer, is now leading the way to becoming an industry giant. Interestingly, we do expect the sales figures to grow moving into the future, given that the game is approaching its first weekend, and in the longer turn, we are anticipating a release on Microsoft's Xbox platform.</p>
<p>For those unaware of why Black Myth: Wukong is such a huge success, the title's rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and unique take on the action RPG formula have attracted the attention of several gamers. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels, not to mention the iconic cutscenes.</p>
<p>The game has received an average <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">Metacritic score</a> of 81, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to. You can look at our review of the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">here</a> as well, where we have delved into the depths of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

You can hire one mercenary to be your main companion to follow you around and designate a second mercenary as reinforcement who will emerge during combat to unleash a special skill when you activate a skill of your own. Each mercenary is unique with their own set of skills. There is the drunken archer Subo, the cursed child Aldkin, the berserker crone Varyana, and the shieldbearer Raheir.

                <p>Sega is asking fans which celebrity cameos they'd like to see in future Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, and the studio has named some interesting ones, such as Keanu Reeves and Jack Black.</p><p>A user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ey18b3/sega_survey_asks_about_yakuzalike_a_dragon_and/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> named JohnConquest shared an email from Sega asking fans which games they've played before or heard of, such as Crazy Taxi and Persona. Then, the email also asks how fans feel about celebrity cameos and if they impact buying decisions.</p><p>At the end of the email, Sega then asks fans to rate some western celebrities and their interest in them if they were to make an appearance in the game. The full list as follows:</p><ul><li>Aidan Gallagher</li><li>Jack Black</li><li>Hiroyuki Sanada</li><li>Lionel Messi</li><li>Xavier Woods</li><li>Hank Azaria</li><li>Danny Trejo</li><li>Minoru Iwasaki</li><li>Rami Malek</li><li>Simone Biles</li><li>Dr. Dre</li><li>Frank Montana</li><li>Robert Pattinson</li><li>Lady Gaga</li><li>Matthew Mercer</li><li>Shohei Ohtani</li><li>Keanu Reeves</li><li>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</li><li>Snoop Dogg</li><li>Ice Cube</li><li>Vin Diesel</li><li>LeBron James</li><li>David Hayter</li><li>Seth Rogen</li><li>Kit Harington</li><li>Mark Hamill</li><li>Eminem</li><li>Ozzy Osbourne</li><li>Billie Eilish</li></ul><p>Of course, this isn't an exhaustive list by any means, and fans have already given some other names they might be interested in, such as Danny Devito. Others have said that it's more entertaining when developer Ryu Ga Gotoku puts parodies in the series, such as Yakuza 0's parody of Michael Jackson named Miracle Johnson.</p><p>Most notably, Danny Trejo had his likeness and voice in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-the-things-money-cant-buy/1900-6418170/" data-ref-id="1900-6418170">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> as the character Dwight Mendez.

However, the studio said that fans will be "surprised" by it.</p>

            <p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic, Ubisoft's long-running turn-based strategy series, is returning for an eighth mainline instalment in 2025, just in time to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - which will be the first new core series entry in nearly a decade - serves as a prequel to the entire fantasy saga, exploring its origins across a non-linear campaign as players journey to Jadame, a "mysterious continent in turmoil" that's been mentioned but never explored in previous games.
</p>
<p>
"Traverse a vibrant and living fantasy world full of wonders and dangers," teases Olden Era's announcement, "build magnificent castles, raise
massive armies and clash in epic and highly tactical battles of heroes and mythical creatures."

<p>
Jadame is set to feature unique factions, biomes, and creatures - all presented in a "refreshed visual style that harks back to the vibrant and magical beginnings of the saga" - alongside new combat mechanics, including active abilities for heroes and creatures, a new faction-based perk system, and more.
</p>
<p>
Faction-wise, Ubisoft has so far confirmed Temple (The classic Knights), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> (Undead and Vampires), Sylvan (The Forces of Nature and Fey Folks), Dungeon (Dark Elves and Underground Creatures), and Hive (Insectoids corrupted by Demons), with a sixth to be revealed at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's talk of revamped AI and multiple difficulty levels, three main game modes - solo, co-op, and multiplayer - as well as a random map generator, and even in-game editor tools, enabling players to share their creations.
</p>
<p>
Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is currently set to arrive in "Q2" next year, and it'll initially be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might__Magic_Olden_Era/">available as a Steam early access title</a> on PC, "allowing players and the community to actively participate in the development of the game."

                <p>In preparation for Episode 9, Act II, launching on August 28, Riot Games has announced Vyse--the latest agent to join the Valorant roster. Many of her abilities focus on stunning enemies to get the upper hand.</p><p>Like every other Agent, Vyse will have four primary abilities that she can use. The first is Arc Rose, allowing her to shoot or place down a rose that can blind anyone who goes through it--including teammates. What's nice about this ability is that it can be picked up and redeployed. She also has Shear--a liquid-metal wall that'll activate whenever an enemy crosses it. Once the wall is up, it'll be indestructible for a few seconds, leaving whoever triggered it alone.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She also has another move called Razorvine, which allows her to place an invisible nest in an area. Once it's triggered, the vines will become visible, and it will damage and slow down enemies inside it. As for her ultimate, it's called Steel Garden. When this is in play, she'll fire liquid metal that'll briefly jam the enemy player's primary gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Vyse will be released alongside Episode 9, Act II, scheduled for next Wednesday, August 28.</p><p dir="ltr">Riot Games has been busy lately. Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valorant-is-now-available-to-play-on-console/1100-6525502/"> the studio announced Valorant was finally available on console</a>. Shortly after that,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/valorant-leaps-onto-most-played-charts-while-the-first-descendant-slips/2900-5668/"> it made its way to the top 10 most-played list on consoles</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Grand strategy games are a bit too big to demo. Building from a single settlement and a couple of farms into a vast nation is a time-consuming process, and even playing tens of early game turns can only show you so much. Even with that being the case, though, a little time with the opening of 4X game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ara-history-untold/" data-ref-id="5000-566096">Ara: History Untold</a> suggests a sprawling entry into the genre that brings along some new ideas that focus on offering lots of different paths for creating a thriving civilization.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of the massive turn-based strategy game Ara: History Untold at Xbox's Gamescom preview event in Los Angeles. That amounted to about 35 turns--just enough to hit the end of the first era of human history and to get a sense of the way Ara approaches a game about being the most influential civilization on the planet. Like most entries in the genre, there are multiple paths to victory in Ara, like building a conquering military, constructing great works of culture, or amassing a ton of wealth.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ara: History Untold Interview | Xbox Games Showcase Extended 2022</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">What was interesting in those early turns was seeing the ways Ara lets you pick a specific path to victory, focusing your gameplay on what you think is most important.</p><p dir="ltr">That starts with choosing your civilization and its leader, of which there are a lot. Ara includes 36 different leader choices, each of whom has their own special bonuses for their civilization. It's in choosing your leader that you home in on a particular gameplay approach, because each one's unique ability can give you major advantages if you play to their strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">I chose Ghana's leader from the abridged list, who gained additional wealth from focusing on mining in the early game, and seeing as I didn't have much time to play, figured benefits in those initial turns would be for the best. Other leaders' abilities gave them upgrades to specific kinds of units or benefits to population or food production, generally in keeping with what their real-life nations actually excel in.</p><p dir="ltr">Ara gives you some additional micromanagement options, too, allowing you to focus on particular elements of your civilization as you're building it. One of the main ones is a crafting system. Keeping your people happy along a variety of metrics is essential to keep your civilization growing and productive, and you can push those meters up by crafting amenities from different resources. Early on, the amenity my city produced was a feast for its residents, which boosted production throughout the city for 10 turns. Different amenities have different effects, so you can make and use different ones depending on your short-term needs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356291"></a><figcaption>As in most 4X games, you start off small, with the early game mostly concerning scouting, upgrading your village, and finding resource-rich territory to claim.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356291-arahistoryuntold_starting_village_7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can also craft other objects that give certain buildings and improvements a leg up. For example, early in the game, scouts you send to explore the world might find caches of resources or tools from past, lost groups of humans. Among the tools, I often found plows I could then assign to my farms, boosting their food production. Much like you might spend money and resources to build specific units, Ara lets you craft items that make changes to the way your civilization functions. It's another way to tune your specific approach to the game, because to craft certain items, you also need to build improvements like a workshop or a forge, and those can have both positive and negative effects on different elements of your nation.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of Ara's gameplay was pretty familiar for 4X and grand strategy games, but with notable twists. Every time my city earned enough research points to unlock a new technology, I was presented with a host of options related to the specific era of human history I was in. These don't function as a tech tree, as these games normally present them, though--instead, you're grabbing a number of options from a list that eventually lead to a specific tech that can kick you into the next technological era.</p><p dir="ltr">Some technologies require earlier ones as prerequisites, but Ara simplifies the entire approach by just giving you a set of technologies and letting you pick the one you want at that moment. It also makes your civilization's development feel a little more organic. Choosing to research grain storage, for instance, gives you big gains in agriculture, but then allows you to unlock fermentation. Developing that technology can let you make alcohol, which increases your people's happiness but lowers their wisdom. However, if you skipped out on the grain storage tech and chose different options, fermentation wouldn't have come up. So you only know about the technologies that are relevant to your path through the game, and have to make moment-to-moment decisions based on your earlier choices, rather than a grand plan devised from knowing what the future will hold.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356292"></a><figcaption>Crafting different items gives you ways to change the focus of your cities and boost the happiness of your people.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356292-arahistoryuntold_crafting_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you advance, you get additional opportunities to choose specific pathways through the game. Like in other 4X games, you'll sometimes trigger one-time events where you have to make a decision. As I was exploring, I ran into a small tribe not far from my city, which seemed similar to the city-states you can encounter in Civilization.</p><p dir="ltr">As with other major civilizations, Ara tracked my relationship with these folks. Meeting them triggered a one-time event in which the tribe asked for some support in the form of extra food. Trading with them would boost our relationship but cost me resources, while refusing their request had the opposite effect. I picked the diplomatic option, and after a few more turns of good relations, the tribe chose to join my nation instead of remaining independent, giving me an instant boost to population, which triggered an expansion of my territory.</p><p dir="ltr">Upgrading my city with improvements like farms and workshops, plus the expansion in population, also gave me an "expert" unit. Like the craftable items, experts can be assigned to your cities in different roles, allowing you to choose specific benefits. The slots I had available allowed me to either boost food production or the speed of building improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">And finally, after a while, my civilization earned me a Paragon--a notable historic figure. These people are similar to the leaders you can choose from at the beginning of the game, offering specific bonuses to your civilization. You can choose how to use a Paragon, with the option to assign them to different jobs. I assigned mine to help us boost our scientific accomplishments, and that decreased the time for me to research technology. Paragons seem to have their own specific strengths that determine what jobs they can do, but there are also a lot of options for how you can assign them--so as with the crafting system, you can use them to address short-term goals or help push your whole civilization in a specific gameplay direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356294"></a><figcaption>The Act system eliminates civilizations that fail to be memorable to the world, relegating them to the dustbin of history.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4356294-arahistoryuntold_leaderscreen_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of the paths you take in what improvements you build, technologies you choose, and units you make, you need to be conscious of keeping your advancements coming. Ara also shakes up the usual 4X gameplay by dividing history into three Acts. The Act system brings what developers call a "battle royale" element to the 4X gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of each Act, all the civilizations in a match are judged on their "prestige," looking at elements like development, expansion, creating great works called Triumphs, and so on. During the transition to the next Act, the bottom half of civilizations are culled from the match--lost to history, essentially, with their civilizations failing to make a mark and becoming forgotten. Those players (or AI-controlled leaders) are eliminated, and at that point, the remaining civilizations can send scouts in to spoil the ruins.</p><p dir="ltr">My time with the demo ended just as I was hitting the Bronze Age, having found a couple other neighboring civilizations but still long before the end of the first Act. According to the score screen, I was only the third-most-prestigious nation, suggesting it might have been about time to get a little more aggressive in my plans. With a focus on quickly expanding to increase the wealth of Ghana, I also hadn't done much in the way of building military units, and I had a potentially aggressive rival civilization not far from my borders, so building up some defenses was probably a rising point on the agenda.</p><p dir="ltr">But with just 35 turns, I only just scratched the surface of what a game of Ara: History Untold would likely entail. It was just enough to get a sense of the many decisions the game adds to the usual 4X cocktail, though--with systems like crafting items, using amenities, and assigning Paragons, there are a lot of small ways you can influence your civilization's trajectory for either long-term planning or short-term needs. I'd like to spend a couple hundred more turns seeing how those choices shake out.</p><p dir="ltr">Ara: History Untold is launching on PC on September 24.</p>
