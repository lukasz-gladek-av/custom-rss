<p>In an <a href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its website, VGHF says it's been building, cataloging, processing, and digitizing its collections since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-officially-launches" rel="nofollow">it started in 2017</a>, and that the library is now "ready to open [its] (virtual) doors to the public for the first time", albeit in Early Access.</p>

<p>As for what the library contains, it'll give you access to "a curated selection of materials" from the wider VGHF library, including unseen game development materials, iconic games' press kits and promos, and "over 1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=g6hIcMax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library-mgs4-promo-booklet.png?itok=2yFwJWGC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>The Video Game History Foundation has launched a massive new gaming history library that anyone can access online.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, VGHF points to what it calls "the Mark Flitman papers", a series of digitized documents and file backups kept in the basement of retired game producer Mark Flitman.</p>

<p>His collection includes work he did for companies like Konami, Acclaim, and Midway during the 90s and 2000s, and it's all available right now for you to view online, along with tons of other materials.</p>

<p>The library also includes "over 100 hours of footage" from developer Cyan's work on the&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>series, including never-before-seen interviews with the development team behind the likes of&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>.</p>

<p>You can access all of this material via an interface that allows you to search for the material you want, view digital items directly in your browser, and even search for text within articles, making this one of the biggest online repositories of gaming information available right now.</p>




<p>As you might expect, the library will also be adding new materials to its archive over the coming years, so even if you don't find what you're looking for now, you may well do in the future.</p>

<p>It's the Video Game History Foundation's self-proclaimed mission to preserve, celebrate, and teach gaming history, and it's doing so through initiatives like the new online library, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">digitizing rare game prototypes</a> and more.</p>

<p>VGHF is one of several organizations currently aiming to bring game preservation to the forefront of conversations within the industry; it joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">GOG and its Preservation Program</a> on that front. Good show, say I.</p>

<p>The voice cast for Sniper Elite Resistance isn’t massive, but one voice sticks out above the rest, and that’s Harry Hawker. His name has drawn attention and it’s time to reveal who has lent their talents to the 2025 Sniper Elite protagonist.</p>



<p>I covered a lot of juicy details in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance review</a>. It was a fair assessment of a series I’m quite fond of, and one I will continue to play. I’ve predominantly been accustomed to the presence of Karl Fairburne over the years, but it’s the part-time persona of Harry Hawker who takes the lead in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<p>His performance is headline-grabbing, and it’s time to remove the hood from the voice actor—kind of.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-harry-hawker-s-voice-actor-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Who is Harry Hawker’s Voice Actor in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Harry Hawker, the man who sniped. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The available information tells us it’s likely Klemens Koehring reprising his role as Harry Hawker for Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>I say “likely,” because I have scoured the internet and gone to the furthest reaches of the Earth to find conclusive proof it’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2182668/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Klemens Koehring</a>. There’s nothing definitive, but all signs point to the talented voice actor—a multi-lingual extraordinaire who’s given his talents to various video games, TV, and movies.</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>Klemens Koehring voiced Harry Hawker in Sniper Elite 4</strong>—confirmed by the game’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6528142/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_c_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>. I can certify Klemens is a voice actor in Sniper Elite Resistance (more on this soon) and Harry Hawker would make the most sense.</p>



<p>I’ve said the performance has garnered attention, and that’s because of the character’s distinctness and uncanny resemblance to Jason Statham. It’s been a topic of discussion for Resistance, but any press is better than none!</p>



<p>If it turns out Klemens Koehring isn’t the voice actor for Harry Hawker and is simply part of the project, we’ll be sure to update this guide and correct it.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-sniper-elite-resistance">All Voice Actors in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Voice actors in Sniper Elite Resistance. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The voice actor pool is a small one for Sniper Elite Resistance, and it includes <strong>Klemens Koehring</strong>, along with other talents such as <strong>Atilla Akinci</strong> and <strong>James Goode</strong>.</p>



<p>Atilla Akinci has voiced characters in Greedfall 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty. Whereas James Goode has provided voiceover work for Diablo 4, Final Fantasy 14, and also Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty.</p>



<p>There’s a wealth of talent in Sniper Elite Resistance, and it deserves to be recognized. As you can see, only names are listed, not their roles, making it slightly more difficult to declare Klemens’ role.</p>

			<p>The Lunar Awakening event has made a return to Diablo IV and will be starting on February 4 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT and will end on February 18 at the same time. Players on either the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Seasonal</a> or Eternal Realms will be able to take place in this event. To participate, activate any Shrine found in Sanctuary (including Nahantu) to earn 100% bonus experience (multiplicative) for two minutes and an enhanced power while earning Ancestral Favor Reputation.</p>
<p>To fully immerse yourself in the Lunar Awakening event, make sure to take a trip to Ked Bardu and go to the Northern part of town. There, you'll find Ying-Yue, who is the leader of the Lunar Night Market. This area will serve as the central hub for the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV. Here, you can redeem your Ancestral Favor Reputation for Unceasing Gifts from Ancestors caches. You can also get decorative Lunar Renewal-themed rewards.</p>
<p>There are Lunar Shrines spread out throughout Sanctuary, where you will have to fight off monsters in dungeons and the overworld to be able to activate the Lunar Shrines. By activating the Shrines and killing monsters, you will be able to net a significant amount of Ancestral Favor Reputation.</p>
<p>The shrines that are typically placed in the world have now been replaced with Lunar Shrines, granting you a 100% experience bonus when activated. You will be able to recognize the shrines thanks to their updated appearance to honor the year of the snake. The shrines also have a unique Map icon, so you will be able to find them with ease and won't have to spend an age exploring trying to find a lunar Shrine.</p>
<p>On the official<a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24174392/pursue-celestial-fortune-in-lunar-awakening" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Blizzard website</a>, you can find all of the Augmented Lunar Shrine effects, which have been adjusted to be in line with the Lunar Awakening event. As well as activating Shrines, Miserly Spirits spawn immediately, which will allow you to capitalize on the Shrine's augmentation.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of rewards you can get for the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV, including the Dragon of the Lonely Moon mount armor, Trag'Oul's Consort Mount, and more, which is also listed on the Blizzard website.</p>
<p>Will you be playing the Lunar Awakening event in Diablo IV?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-updates-paused-as-grinding-gear-focuses-on-path-of-exile-2.1096002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced that it's pausing updates for the first game while it works on&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>.</p>

<p>In a video message to fans, game director Jonathan Rogers says that Grinding Gear "can't really work on [upcoming update]&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>3.26 before&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has shipped", and that the studio "probably need[s] to support that for a couple of weeks" after launch, too.</p>

<p>While the studio will be working on "a bunch of preproduction" for <i>Path of Exile&nbsp;</i>update 3.26, it'll be dragging across staff from the first game in order to work on the second, which Rogers says still has "major issues", making it the priority for Grinding Gear at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=BPMhx2Ys 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-updates-paused-path-of-exile-2-lightning.jpg?itok=j17ztKKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for the first&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>are being paused while Grinding Gear works on the second game.</figcaption></figure><p>Rogers goes on to say that it's "hard to even think about" what the team might create for&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>when the sequel has "really obvious problems that need fixing".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that once&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>0.2.0 has been launched, the team will "devote as many resources as are needed" to get&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>update 3.26 finished "as soon as possible".</p>

<p>Previously, Rogers had said that dedicating resources to both&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em>and its sequel "shouldn't be an issue", and that Grinding Gear Games is "set up" in a way that allows it to do so. Evidently, however, that's not the case, at least not this time.</p>

<p>You can see Rogers' full video message, which contains a little more information regarding the shift in focus, right here.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>originally started life as a major update for the first game, but eventually, its scope expanded to the point that Grinding Gear Games decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">make it its own title instead</a>.</p>

<p>The game was released to a broadly positive reception from players, although several issues were identified, leading Grinding Gear to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">promise fixes for those issues</a> in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2-game-preview/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The first game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/path-of-exile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can play that one for free, too.</p>

Feral Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light-review/1900-6280082/" data-ref-id="1900-6280082">Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</a> is coming to iOS and Android platforms on February 27.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-ufAlMu9Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JC-ufAlMu9Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was originally released on Xbox Live and PSN in 2010, and it dropped the Tomb Raider branding and the series' traditional gameplay model. Instead, it adapted a fixed-camera viewpoint and embraced co-op gameplay as Lara teamed up with an ancient Mayan warrior called Totec to defeat the evil spirit known as Xolotl. Feral Interactive previously ported The Guardian of Light and its 2014 sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review/1900-6415985/" data-ref-id="1900-6415985">Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</a>, to Nintendo Switch as part of The Lara Croft Collection in 2023.</p><p>Outside of the gaming realm, there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series/1100-6523431/" data-ref-id="1100-6523431">live-action Tomb Raider series</a> in development at Prime Video that may star Game of Thrones' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-star-sophie-turner-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-tomb-raider-tv-show-report/1100-6527775/" data-ref-id="1100-6527775">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>.

Additionally, Netflix renewed the animated series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-renewed-for-season-2/1100-6527395/" data-ref-id="1100-6527395">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft for a second season</a>.</p><p>Console gamers may want to pass the time between sequels with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-versions-coming-to-switch-xbox-and-playstation/1100-6527121/" data-ref-id="1100-6527121">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a>, which features modern ports of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Tomb Raider: Chronicles, and Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has laid off several of its employees as part of an initiative to become a "more agile" studio, although the developer itself hasn't officially announced these layoffs.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> by Rock Paper Shotgun, several BioWare employees who worked on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, including lead writer Trick Weekes and producer Jennifer Cheverie (among others), have posted on social media that they're now looking for a new job.</p>

<p>Yesterday, BioWare posted a studio <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>&nbsp;in which general manager Gary McKay said the studio was becoming "a more agile, focused studio", referring obliquely to "today's news" and refraining from announcing any of the staff departures that were subsequently confirmed by staff members themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=ZepTStaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-combat.jpg?itok=eZWGZM6v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s flop appears to have led to layoffs at BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>McKay also says that "a core team" at BioWare is currently working on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, and that the game will boast the involvement of folks who worked on the original trilogy. He cites names like series producer Mike Gamble, designer Preston Watamaniuk, and cinematics animator Parrish Ley.</p>

<p>He also says that given the "stage of development" the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>is currently at, the team doesn't "require support from the full studio", and so some BioWare employees have been moved to "other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit".</p>

<p>While this isn't necessarily the sole reason behind these layoffs, it's worth noting that EA recently revealed its flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was a flop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">selling around half of the copies</a> the publisher expected it to shift.</p>

<p>The game also spent a very, very long time in development, undergoing at least one major reboot before being shaped into the game that was eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">released in October</a>.</p>




<p>Right before these layoffs were reported,&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that she was leaving BioWare, so it's possible that she jumped before she was pushed.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, all eyes are now on the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>, which seemingly has a lot of work to do if it's going to pull BioWare back from what appears to be a pretty dangerous brink. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Months later, the studio behind both games—Grinding Gear—explains why that didn’t happen and gives a brief inside look at why simultaneously juggling development on two live-service games  is such a headache.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“When we launched <em>PoE 2</em> we promised we could continue to release <em>PoE 1</em> expansions, and we do intend to keep that promise but it’s certainly been a lot harder to deliver on than what we expected,” game director Jonathan Rogers said in a new community update <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF4rqnPoo80&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF4rqnPoo80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published on YouTube</a></span>.

The biggest roadblock was the amount of work the sequel’s end game needed going into the holiday season and beyond, and the desire to fix what was broken before going back to a game that was already working.</p><p>First, the team didn’t want to ship <em>PoE 1</em>'s update the same time<em> PoE 2</em> was coming into Early Access. Then, <em>PoE 2</em> was delayed by a few weeks at the same time developers for <em>PoE 1</em> had been pulled off the game to help get the sequel out. After that were all of the problems with the very successful but still buggy Early Access launch, and things only snowballed from there. </p><p>“How could I justify taking some of the most experienced developers we have off <em>PoE 2</em> when it’s on fire?” he said. While the team had previously hoped to get <em>PoE 1</em>'s update out by February, they eventually realized they needed to stop “fooling ourselves” that <em>PoE 2 </em>would get to the perfect place in time for the old game’s next update to go out. </p><p>“It means we can’t really work on <em>PoE 1 </em>[version] 3.26 until<em> PoE 2</em> [version] 0.1.2 has shipped,” Rogers told fans. “And if I’m being honest, it probably means we need to support that for a couple of weeks after that as well.” He added that he’s “really sorry” about how things ended up and says it was a mistake to take developers off the update for the old game and think they could still make their dates. Basically, <em>PoE 1</em> players will need to sit tight for at least a couple months more at this point. </p><p>Despite the unexpected delays, Grinding Gear Games still plans to stick to its multi-game approach to development. Rogers said it will just take time to figure out the best way to do that. Whether people still playing the first <em>Path of Exile</em> will show patience and grace while waiting for that to shake out is another question entirely. So far at least, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1idlzz1/after_jonathans_update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1idlzz1/after_jonathans_update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the answer appears to be no</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When is a game too difficult? For my sanity, it’s when playing it becomes such a chore that you’d rather do household chores instead. For me, Laika: Aged Through Blood is one such game; obviously brilliant but stupidly hard.</p>
<p><iframe title="Laika: Aged Through Blood │ Pre-Order Teaser │ Nintendo Switch ????????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UoWNET0bRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/08/laika-aged-through-blood-review/">PC and other consoles back in 2023</a>, Laika: Aged Through Blood has now been ported over to Nintendo Switch. It tells the dark tale of Laika, an anthropomorphic coyote. Half mum, half warrior, half butt-kicking bad ass, Laika is up against the Bird faction, a tyrannical bunch of megalomaniacs, intent on taking over the land and wiping out her village.</p>


<p>Despite its gorgeous hand-drawn artwork, sumptuous animation, and cute animal characters, Laika: Aged Through Blood is unrelentingly bleak. The game opens with the depiction of a child cayote who has been strangled to death and strung up by their own innards. Grim. Frankly, the levels of gore, despair, and cruel unrelenting violence were rather too much for me. But hey, to each their own, and regardless of my sensitive constitution, Laika: Aged Through Blood tells an engaging and emotional story. Maybe just don’t eat before playing?</p>


<p>The game is an intriguing hybrid that’s Metroidvania and part motorbike sim. That’s right, you get the exploration, power-up gathering, puzzle solving and resource gathering of a Metroidvania, alongside the motorbike controls and physics of an entry from Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/04/16/trials-fusion-review/">Trials</a> series. It’s an eclectic mix to be sure, but it works, forging the two disparate elements into a cohesive experience, one dubbed ‘Motorvania’ by the developers.</p>
<p>Laika speeds around the environment with a squeeze of the trigger, leaving you responsible for spinning her bike into front flips or back flips. Doing so will recharge both your parry ability – only, you know, parrying with <em>a motorbike</em> – and your ammunition. Shooting from the bike activates slow motion bullet time, which is absolutely essential to stand a chance at hitting one of the many bird henchavians, blasting away with their rifles as you zoom along. Ammunition is scarce, your first weapon, a pistol, carries only two shoots, so incorporating opportunities to flip your bike is integral to success.</p>

<p>It sounds like it shouldn’t work but it does, brilliantly so. Gameplay is satisfying and morish. Each encounter will result in your death numerous times, but on each try your reflexes improve a little, until you finally nail the timing of that back flip, blocking a spray of bullets with your bike, before landing perfectly, reloading, and blowing away the crow that blocks your path. Alongside all the action there’s some welcome downtime, allowing you to explore the gorgeous labyrinthian surroundings, discovering new abilities that might, <em>just might</em>, keep you alive a little longer during the next battle.</p>
<p>So, as you may have gathered, Laika: Aged Through Blood is unrelentingly difficult. Get hit, you’re dead. Fail to land your bike just right, you’re dead. Do pretty much anything wrong, you’re dead. Controls are precise and demanding, but there’s little room for error. Accessibility is almost absent – other than the option to not die quite as instantly if you mistime a landing – with no difficulty levels to choose from, meaning you’re stuck with evil mode. Thankfully, quick save points are plentiful, but that doesn’t mitigate the unrelenting grind of the difficulty, which quickly wore me down.</p>

<p>Normally the darling of Indie games, the Switch in handheld mode is a poor fit for Laika: Aged Through Blood. The 6.2″ screen is too small to enable you to see the teeny tiny bullets that you’ll need to dodge and reflect with the required ninja-like timing, and the controls of the Switch are too fiddly to provide the precision demanded. It’s also rather erratically laggy when the screen gets busy, making the game even harder than anything should have any right to be. Docked mode is frankly the only way you stand a chance of success, and even then, chances are slim.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>As one of the first preview events of 2025, Funcom recently invited Wccftech out to their hometown of Oslo, Norway to take part in one of the first exclusive hands-on events for the upcoming survival multiplayer game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune Awakening</a>. As part of a group of less than fifty influencers and journalists alike, we were permitted to experience the first four hours, beginning with character creation without guard rails.</span></p>
<p><span>Creative Director Joel Bylos started off the event by presenting a bit of Funcom’s vision for their take on Arrakis and the creative liberties they can work with. For inspiration, Dune Awakening is primarily built upon the first Frank Herbert’s books in the Dunology: Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. In working with an established Hollywood film series, there were some constraints that Funcom had to follow, including not being permitted to show Fremen in the game as Hollywood wanted to define how the Fremen looked, as well as keep a number of characters and plot points under wraps as not to unintentionally spoil Dune Part 3. As Joel succinctly put it, “constraints lead to freedom and [thinking] around corners”.</span></p>
<p><span>Funcom wanted to reiterate once again that Dune Awakening doesn’t have a second M in the genre and is rather a multiplayer survival game set upon a shared Arrakis with hundreds of players. Ditching the MMO moniker, or at least the word massive, was important to distance themselves from the grind mindset where quests dictate progression rather than crafting. For Funcom, the endgame intended for Dune Awakening is political intrigue and faction warfare. For some, the ultimate goal in Dune Awakening will be battling rival houses and that visceral PVP component they have planned.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DA_SpiceBlow-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Funcom’s intended focus for Dune Awakening is built upon five distinct pillars that make up SPICE. S, for Survival and the player’s constant struggle for water, shelter, and thriving away from sand worms. P, for Political Survival and the endgame of aligning with one of 25 great houses to issue server-wide decrees based on the winning vote tallies (one example Joel gave was to say that all PVP is full-loot PVP, with players dropping their entire inventory upon death). I, for Infinite Exploration and the cartography and exploration with a map that changes week to week as coriolis storms wipe out the surface of Arrakis and both hides and resurfaces landmarks with the occasional unique point of interest or dungeon being revealed. C, for Combined Arms and their focus on blending both melee and ranged combat together. Lastly, E is for Expression and Customization, with the central focus on the building systems as well as player build and fashion customizations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our hands-on with Dune: Awakening was focused on the first phase of the intended flow of gameplay: Survival. From the first moments of character creation to literally being dropped into a dank cave and being forced to carve one's way out, Dune: Awakening is heavy on the tutorials as new mechanics are conferred upon the player and build up much like sand in an hourglass. For every mission meant to drive the story forward, players have ten or so objectives to learn about crafting and gathering to go through first.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of what we were able to experience firsthand was still just the tutorial meant to introduce players to the essentials of base crafting and constructing our first vehicle in order to proceed further north into the sand dunes. With only a limited fraction of the skills and tools available, we did not have the chance to delve out into learning abilities from other classes or craft unique armaments beyond a couple of low-rank armor schematics I came across in an ecolab overtaken by bandits that gave me a suspensor belt with a powerful glide that would help me traverse into climbing areas that I wouldn’t ordinarily have been able to reach on minimal stamina.</span></p>
<p><span>Combat is a bit of a mixed bag in my early few hours with Dune: Awakening. While I’m certainly glad that Funcom is ambitious about finding ways to make melee and ranged weapons both equally effective, in its current state, both systems could use a bit more refining to make them feel like more than just wildly flailing around at times. This early in the narrative, the player doesn’t have access to shields, while just about every humanoid that’s in the player’s way is equipped with one as part of their standard kit. To get around this, there’s really ultimately two ways that work consistently well. One is to waste all of your darts trying to overpower the enemy and overload their shields; the other is to nail a simple three-hit melee combo and then hold down the attack button for a slow blade to push through the shields and attack directly. I’d like to see more creative ways to disable an enemy’s shields in the final release rather than the same simple combo over and over again. The combat designer did show some mid-level gameplay with mixing in active skills like a flying knee that might help spice up (pun intended) combat in the later stages.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DA_Slowblade-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Early game crafting in Dune: Awakening comes down to harvesting whatever materials you can hoard and then making a simple base from scratch (floor, four walls, ceiling, and a door at the minimum) and slowly building out to introduce new crafting facilities after completing tutorials over time. Making a base also creates a new spawn point, giving a little incentive to stop and take a breather after filling your pockets with stones. Players have the agency to construct their buildings freely as they wish, although there weren’t options to lock pieces such as walls together or even rotate an object before placing it in the base. I found that I had to physically walk around and pixel hunt to find the perfect spot where I could drop an ore refinery without overlapping a nearby storage crate.</span></p>
<p><span>When I found myself wanting to move into the northern segment of the map, I farmed up the resources to create a base duplicator tool and copied my existing base only to attempt to deploy it in another location. The immediate problem I discovered is that it only copies the overall layout, so it was up to me to farm a whole second set of materials to start crafting my base, something that took a fair bit of time to even get the requisite amount of stone to create the foundation and walls. In hindsight, it would make sense that I couldn’t effectively duplicate my materials but it wasn’t immediately obvious given the limited tooltips available in the current build.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DA_PlayerBase-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Funcom is in the midst of crafting a worthy follow-up to Frank Herbert’s legacy with the book series’ first multiplayer RPG outside the MUDs of the early 1990s. While there’s still some polish left to be applied to both the combat and crafting mechanics, the spice is already in place to be Funcom’s next breakaway hit. Keep your blue eyes open for a Dune: Awakening PC launch later this year, with console ports on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X to follow.</span></p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive has revealed the official PC requirements for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, its upcoming RPG title that is powered by Unreal Engine 5. This game will have turn-based combat with real-time mechanics, similar to how some of the older Final Fantasy games played out. This title is set for release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-on-april-24th-on-pc-and-consoles-new-trailer-released/">April 24</a>.</p>
<p>The hype for this game is very evidently building, as the developer has <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1884236416428958184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1884236416428958184%7Ctwgr%5Ec3aa43106c54a8d3021313417b30769f5d622fe2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2025%2F01%2Fclair-obscur-expedition-33-is-so-popular-the-dev-cant-meet-collectors-edition-demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a> saying that they are struggling to meet the demand for the Collector's Editions of the game. Part of their message said: "The outpouring of support has been wonderful, and we see your messages requesting restocks of certain editions and availability in your regions or for particular consoles. Truthfully, getting these made was a monumental feat for us. We are so grateful to see that the demand was there and that it exceeded our expectations."</p>
<p>With that message, they said that they can't promise there will be restocks of particular editions, as there are some limitations that may get in the way. Below are the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Minimum</strong></td>
<td>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>OS:</strong></td>
<td>Windows 10</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Storage:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>55 GB available space</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></td>
<td>For 1080p 30FPS low settings gameplay</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>For 1080p 30FPS settings, these requirements are relatively reasonable. Below are the recommended requirements for 1080p 60FPS gameplay.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recommended</strong></td>
<td>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>OS:</strong></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Those are the settings that you need to be aware of if you're planning on picking up Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for PC. The recommended requirements are quite beefy in comparison to what the minimum requirements ask of you, but they also make sense, considering that the game has been developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won't suffer from the issues that games typically suffer from being made in Unreal Engine 5. For example, Silent Hill 2 was very unoptimized and had a significant amount of stuttering when it was first released on PC.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Clair Obscur: Expedition 33?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire.1095933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/laika-aged-through-blood-review-burst-tyre-under-fire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s never a dull moment to freshly visit a release that’s already got more than enough critical lauding behind it. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em>, developed by Spanish team Brainwash Gang, and dubbed “Motorvania”, has already met the positive end of the critical reception stick since its release in 2023. 2 years later, it has finally driven over to the Nintendo Switch, which you’d assume to be a perfect victory lap.</p>

<p>You play as Laika, an immortal anthropomorphic dog who’s in an endless war alongside her similar animal compatriots against a covenant of birds, who’ve deemed themselves genetically superior. Due to her accursed immortality, she’s often seen as the first and last line of defense for the rest of her cabal, who are preparing for a devastating weapon to be used against them by the birds. In between all of this, she is the mother to a growing and otherwise affable pup, who’s destined to take her mantle, as well as her curse, much to the chagrin of Laika.</p>

<p>When I say “Motorvania”, what exactly does that entail? Well, that requires a bit of context. <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>is a title specifically inspired by the Adobe Flash games of old, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/trials-fusion-review" rel="nofollow">Trials</a> </em>to <em>Bush Shoot-Out</em>. It’s the former that is obviously the bigger mine for inspiration, as <em>Laika </em>utilizes old-school Flash bike-riding as its main movement mechanic. As such, you’ll be flipping your bike, wheelie-ing, and struggling with the most curvaceous of hills for most of your playtime.</p>



<p>Not only that but there’s combat on top, the closest comparison being something like the equally audacious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friend-pedro-review-max-pedro" rel="nofollow"><em>My Friend Pedro</em></a>. The difference between the two however is that instadeath is a permanent possibility throughout your playthrough, but Laika can fight back. The underside of your motorbike can deflect most bullets, as well as your character being able to turn on the 2D platforms in order to deflect bullets on a straight plane.</p>

<p>It’s an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master mechanic, and one that initially provides some berth and exceptionally high swells of pride once you perfect it. Drive head-first into a valley of trigger-happy avian bastards, and spam bullets in every direction until the screen turns into a sea of magnetically-attracted currency and guts. Once it starts, <em>Laika </em>will never let off the brakes, and that’s both a blessing and a burden.</p>

<p>It’s quite easy to find yourself stuck in a relentless cycle of dying and restarting over and over again just to perfect a single section that’s just as likely to have another difficulty spike behind it. It’s an endurance test in how much BS you can take before you either break through with bloody knuckles or shut the console off and say “That’s enough”. As it stands, the latter was the more likely outcome for me.</p>



<p>As it stands, <em>Laika </em>is a game where you have to put the time in, especially when its main movement mechanic defines the progression. As such, the level design seeks to at least be engaging enough throughout the entire runtime with obstacle courses and trick jumps you’re more likely to see in <em>Trials</em>-adjacent titles. However, this doesn’t make backtracking necessarily interesting, more that it becomes a permeating checklist of remembering exactly how and where you’re meant to execute specific jumps on specific ramps, that look like every other specific jump or specific ramps.</p>

<p>This is something that correlates to Brainwash Gang’s history, as their debut game, <em>Nongunz</em>, was a similar war of attrition between how far you’re willing to go to progress, or hell, even understand. In <em>Nongunz</em>’ case, however, the playing field wasn’t surmounted by what could – in certain pretenses – be described as a gimmick. Gimmicky narrative? Sure, but there are bigger demons in sight here.</p>

<p>For one, despite <em>Nongunz</em>’ mono-chromatic visual design, enough attention was paid to busier arenas to make sure the player wasn’t overwhelmed with odds. In <em>Laika</em>, the visual design has been over-produced to the point where it’s an unintelligible mess in its peaks, at least on the Nintendo Switch. This isn’t a case of playing on handheld either, whether it’s the handheld mode, or docked, <em>Laika </em>is simply too busy of a game to justify its messy proceedings.</p>



<p>How do we fix this? Make the camera static. Seriously, <em>Laika </em>is much too interested in constantly messing up perspective, as well as throwing mixed challenges of precision platforming and sludgy combat which I can’t ascertain is a design decision or not. Performance is all over the place on the Nintendo Switch, which puts me in the camp of believing this is a poorly-performing port.</p>

<p>So the question becomes “Is <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> worth driving through despite this?”, and the answer I came to is “no”. The long and short of it is that the story is much too interested in pitting its frankly mawkish narrative against the even more absurd gameplay core of <em>Trials-</em>flipping combat nonsense. It’s an exceptionally harsh juxtaposition that’s hard to shake off unless you’re fully committed to its over-wrought presentation.</p>

<p>It’s not without its failings, mind you. As was the case with <em>Nongunz</em>, <em>Laika </em>is blessed with an utterly fantastic and melancholic soundtrack, <a href="https://beicoli.bandcamp.com/album/laika-aged-through-blood-ost" rel="nofollow">composed by Beatriz Ruiz-Castillo</a>. They’re a collectible within the world also, and you bet your bottom dollar they’re worth going the extra mile for. Beautifully composed, and far and away, the most well-intentioned and aligned aspect of <em>Laika</em>’s more gloomy angles.</p>



<p>There’s a distinct flavor to how <em>Laika </em>presents its story, one which requires full dedication to the edginess of its world-building. I mean, it starts off with your daughter wailing at the sight of a crucified anthropomorphic animal - quite upsetting in its depiction, but in hindsight, silly as you see how Laika enacts revenge by being the best showboating motorbike rider in the wastelands.</p>

<h2><em>Laika: Aged Through Blood </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>In any other timeline, the kind of antics <em>Laika: Aged Through Blood</em> showcases would be a perfect fit for the kind of platforming shenanigans the Nintendo Switch is known for at this point. This isn’t the case, however, as its overdesigned, overcomplicated, and indeed, overcooked storyline fails to make a dent in the library's more venerated classics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-155<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have released a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and it brings four brand new cars for you to drive, plus an expansion to the game's Sophy AI system and more.</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-152" rel="nofollow">set the precedent</a> of bringing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144" rel="nofollow">new cars to check out</a>, and this one's no different, starting with the original formula car F3500-A, which has been created "in the image of classic F1 cars". If you like old-school racing machines, you'll love this one.</p>

<p>Your next new car is the Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) '87, a touring car racer that's also known as the Grand Civic, and it's known for being used at events like the Japan Touring Car Championship.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=zm7JmJAd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.55-new-cars.jpg?itok=S_JvEj0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Four new cars are available to drive in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.55.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's the Hyundai IONIQ 5 N '24, a revision of Hyundai's first all-electric model that "challenges the preconceptions of BEVs", according to Sony (that's battery electric vehicles, by the way).</p>

<p>Last but not least, you can now also drive the Toyota C-HR S '18, an "unconventional crossover SUV" most famous for taking on the&nbsp;Nürburgring 24 Hours circuit in prototype form. Pretty impressive stuff, no?</p>

<p>All four of these cars can be purchased from&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Brand Central, so head on over there and pick up whichever is your favorite (or all of them, if you're so inclined).</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer that shows off these cars, as well as some other elements of the new update, right here.</p>




<p>Also new in this update are two new courses for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI racing agent, as well as new events in the game's World Circuits and more. You can take a look at everything that's been added <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/30/gran-turismo-7-update-1-55-details-revealed-live-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>; unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">many other Sony first-party games</a>, it's yet to secure itself a PC release. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The movie lineup looks particularly strong, with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163962/knives-out-sequel-wake-up-dead-man-release-date-netflix">Wake Up Dead Man</a></em> — the next <em>Knives Out </em>mystery, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23349099/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery-review-netflix-tiff-2022">Glass Onion</a></em> — and Guillermo del Toro’s take on <em>Frankenstein</em> both due out later this year. Meanwhile, some of the streamer’s most important properties are coming to an end with the final seasons of both <em>Stranger Things</em> (which still doesn’t have a premiere date) and <em>Squid Game</em> (which now does).</p><p>And while <em>Stranger Things</em> is ending, its creators, the Duffer brothers, did detail two projects they will have coming to Netflix in 2026: <em>The Boroughs</em> and <em>Something Very Bad Is Going to Happen</em>. (They also hinted that there are some <em>Stranger Things</em> spinoffs in the works, without getting into detail.)</p><p>As for what to expect this year, here are the highlights:</p><div><p id="film"><h2>Film</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</em> — February 11th</span></li><li><span><em>Plankton: The Movie</em> — March 7th</span></li><li><span><em>The Electric State </em>— March 14th</span></li><li><span><em>The Old Guard 2</em> — July 2nd</span></li><li><span><em>Fear Street: Prom Queen</em> — summer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Frankenstein</em> — November</span></li><li><span><em>Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>RIP</em> — fall</span></li><li><span><em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>K-Pop: Demon Hunters</em> — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="tv"><h2>TV</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Cobra Kai</em> season 6 (part 3) — February 13th</span></li><li><span><em>Zero Day</em> — February 20th</span></li><li><span><em>Devil May Cry</em> — April 3rd</span></li><li><span><em>You</em> season 5 — April 24th</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span><em>Squid Game</em> season 3 — June 27th</span></li><li><span><em>Black Mirror</em> season 7 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Department Q</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Sandman</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Stranger Things </em>season 5 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>The Witcher</em> season 4 — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wayward</em> — 2025</span></li><li><span><em>Wednesday</em> season 2 — 2025</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="games"><h2>Games</h2></p></div><p>While the lineup of (announced) games coming to Netflix is fairly small, there are two notable highlights: a mobile version of <em>WWE 2K</em> this fall to go along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337368/wwe-offers-a-nostalgic-look-back-at-its-past-before-raws-netflix-debut">the new deal between the two</a>, and more Netflix Stories games (Netflix’s branding for interactive fiction) based on series like <em>Ginny &amp; Georgia, Sweet Magnolias, Love Is Blind, </em>and<em> Outer Banks</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The last Minesweeperalike I wrote up was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a sparkling slurry of mind-altering pop-ups and resinous AI cleavage</a>. It was David Cronenberg's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>: The Substance Edition, and I was sincerely worried that I'd put you all off Minesweeper for life. But before you mop your last munition and turn in your index finger for good, give Dragonsweeper a try. It's Minesweeper with an altogether less atrocious twist which you can hopefully deduce from the name.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's right, Dragonsweeper is Minesweeper but an RPG. It's a smart genre hybrid that gives the principle of tentatively clicking blank squares to reveal nearby mines a level-up system, and swaps (most of) the mines for monsters like walking skeletons, gremlins and, yes, dragons. I know, I know: giving hitherto unencumbered games a progression mechanic is cultural vandalism, but trust me, it's more charming than you might guess.</p>
<p>Uncleared tiles near the exposed play area have numbers on them. In regular Minesweeper, these indicate the number of explosives nearby, but there's a little more to it here. Part of Dragonsweeper's fun, of course, is working out how, exactly, developer Daniel Benmergui has glued all these archetypes together, so I won't say anything further. If you're stuck, though, there's a manual with a bestiary.</p>
<p>You can play Dragonsweeper in a browser <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper">right here</a>. Thanks very much to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-29">Maw</a> feeder Titus Groen for passing this on. It has swallowed up a couple of my teabreaks, though I've yet to actually clear the board. If you prefer vanilla Minesweeper, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-minesweeper">a little lookback</a> from Matthew Castle (RPS in peace).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K Is Coming To Netflix Games This Year]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k-is-coming-to-netflix-games-this-year.1095918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k-is-coming-to-netflix-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>WWE 2K is joining the Netflix Games library. In an <a href="https://xcancel.com/netflixgames_/status/1884966547220836524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement on Thursday morning</a>, WWE and Netflix announced that WWE 2K will be coming to Netflix Games in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>“This isn’t just another mobile game,” WWE superstar CM Punk said in the video announcement. “This is your chance to live the most extreme, the most intense, the most dominant WWE experience right in the palm of your hands.”</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WWE2KNetflix.png" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PQwyWHBKjIL6XM5K.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the game that’s coming, but it could be assumed, based on the messaging, that the game is a mobile-specific WWE 2K game for the platform as opposed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">version of WWE 2K25</a>. The best comparison could be to how Football Manager is on mobile compared to PC and console.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait that long for a new WWE game, WWE 2K25 launches on March 7 for those who buy the $100 Deadman Edition or $130 Bloodline Edition. If you buy the Standard Edition, you get the game a week later on March 14. That game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>



<p>Netflix Games is currently available to all subscribers for no extra fees. The library boasts <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 120 mobile games</a> to play. To play games from the library, you need:</p>



<ul>
<li>An active Netflix subscription</li>



<li>Android device running Android 8.0 or later</li>



<li>iPhone with iOS 15+ or iPad with iPadOS 15+</li>



<li>An internet connection to download the game</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I went to see Funcom's survival MMO <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> last week and one thing I expected while there was a specific release date. The game has an "early 2025" date, currently, which is the time period we're in. So a major press event held within that period of time would be a perfect place to make a release announcement. But no such announcement was made.</p>
<p>It raised questions about how near to release Dune: Awakening actually is. I put these questions to the game's executive producer Scott Junior, and his reply feels like a much more accurate estimation of when to expect it. "I guess it depends how you define early," Junior said. "It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Incidentally, Junior's referring to a PC (Steam) release. Console versions are part of the plan but they're coming later at an unspecified date. Also, in case there's any confusion, that's a full 1.0 release - there's no early access. The game has been in closed beta testing already for about a year.</p>

<figcaption>This video is from Gamescom last year so a few things have been altered and tweaked since then, but it's still a solid and very detailed look at the game.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J18oH_FBDYM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another question mark surrounds the game's business model, which again, Funcom hasn't announced. Naturally, there are assumptions of free-to-play and battle pass monetisation methods - Funcom having used an in-game shop in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> - but I saw no evidence of a shop in the Dune: Awakening build I played at all.</p><p>Again, I put this to Junior. "We will announce our monetisation strategy a little bit closer to launch," he said. "There will not be any subscription, though - I can say that." He was also happy to clarify, "It will not be free-to-play." Chances are Dune: Awakening will be a premium-priced game.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening is a significant bet for Funcom. It's been in development for five years and more than 400 people have worked on it. It's the studio's biggest ever game, Junior said - bigger than The Secret World and Age of Conan, and an order of magnitude larger than the 30-person team that turned the company's ailing fortunes around with Conan Exiles in 2017. Will it work?</p>
<p>I was impressed by what I played. Dune: Awakening is what a lot of MMOs aren't, necessarily, and that's interesting - conceptually interesting. In bringing survival concepts into a persistent, massively-multiplayer space, Funcom has made something that feels subtly but fundamentally new. It's also the closest recreation we'll get of the filmic world of Dune that's so popular right now.
