<p>It’s that time of the year when you finally treat yourself or someone takes pity on you and buys you that one piece of tech you’ve been eyeing all year. For many, that’s the Steam Deck. If you woke up and unboxed a Steam Deck, well, congratulations! But here are a few of the games you should check out first on your new PC handheld!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-games-on-steam-deck-for-new-owners">The Best Games on Steam Deck for New Owners</h2>



<p>The list of available titles for the Steam Deck grows seemingly daily, with new game releases and old titles finally receiving verification. Before long, everything will be playable on the handheld. But for now, you must still pick and choose, though it’s from an absolutely astounding library of games. Here are just a handful of what you can expect to enjoy on your new Steam Deck:</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I think Tom would be rather upset with me if I didn’t mention Balatro. But more so than that, it’s an incredible roguelike deckbuilder with innovative gameplay, that borderline enthralling one-more-turn style of gameplay we love, and quite accessible mechanics that warrant a playthrough or ten. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t know poker because Balatro is so simple to grasp!</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite titles to date. I used to play a ton of Harvest Moon, and then I graduated to Stardew on release day and never looked back. I’ve spent nearly 300 hours playing the indie farming simulator on Steam Deck alone, as it’s such a simple game to pick up and play with the handheld. It runs smoothly, the battery life is excellent, and the game functions better with a controller than with a mouse and keyboard, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t expect to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck for extended periods, as the massive role-playing game will burn through the handheld battery quickly. That said, the turn-based combat and easy maneuverability of the game work splendidly on the handheld controls of the Deck. If you want a game that will suck up countless hours of your free time without leaving the couch, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the go-to choice for many.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-or-hades-2">Hades (Or Hades 2!)</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was initially unsure about Hades, as I was still relatively new to the roguelike genre upon its release. However, after too many recommendations, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. It’s a challenging yet satisfying action hack-and-slash in which you’ll power up your abilities and move over time, delving further into the Underworld as you go. It functions perfectly on Steam Deck, and the bite-size maps allow you to play on your own time.</p>



<h3 id="h-cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cult of the Lamb was my Game of the Year in 2022, and an absolute surprise that I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy until my wife bought it for me as an early birthday present. Well, I was hooked. I immediately sunk 50 hours into a single playthrough, and then I did it again on PC. Then, I started playing on Steam Deck and wound up with another four complete playthroughs on the handheld. It runs well and has impressive battery life. But the technical stuff, while fun, is only a small part of the experience. You can run a cult, build your base, and venture into the wilds with powerful weapons and spells!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24312434/best-roguelikes-2024-balatro-hades-2-prince-of-persia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The roguelike genre has turned from a relative niche into something much bigger. Roguelike games can be famously tough to crack into; generally, they have a high difficulty that means you’ll bang your head against a wall as you learn how to play the game, puzzle out what strategies work best in the procedurally generated levels, and figure out how to overcome tough enemies or challenges. 2024 showed that the genre wasn’t only a commercial force through hits like <em>Hades II</em> and <em>Balatro</em>, and also that a roguelike could be almost anything: from a poker variant to a flashy multiplayer action game.</p><p>Speaking of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, it was undoubtedly one of, if not <em>the</em>, best games of the year. The game is supremely easy to pick up because of its roots in building traditional poker hands, but each round feels wildly different because of the clever and sometimes superpowered joker cards that can give you massive bonuses. The game is a perfect mix of skill, risk, and a little bit of luck, and it feels so good when you find a strategy that completely stacks the chips in your favor. I think I’ll be playing <em>Balatro</em> for years to come, especially with whatever’s cooking for the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">upcoming major update</a>. And now that the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">is out on mobile</a>, I can play wherever I want.</p><p>That is, when I’m not dipping my toes back into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance"><em>Hades II</em></a>. The game, which is still in early access, is shaping up to be a worthy successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, and it’s arguably more fully fleshed out than many finished titles. I’ve already put more than 30 hours into <em>Hades II, </em>and I feel like I still have so much to unlock and master, but I’ve intentionally held myself back from playing more so that I don’t burn out on the game before it reaches v1.0. I only beat the new boss in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">most recent major update</a> a single time before deciding that was enough.</p><p>There are a couple other roguelikes that I have loved and want to put more time into but haven’t because of the sheer volume of other games in the genre to check out. <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which is all about tactics and positioning, makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">you feel like a genius by showing you the future</a>. I really enjoyed getting a handle on the game’s weapons and items so that I could pull off well-planned combos against waves of enemies.</p><p><em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from <em>Dead Cells</em> creators Motion Twin, takes a lot of what makes <em>Dead Cells</em> great and translates it to 3D. Weapons are varied, satisfying, and can combo well with each other. The game’s biomes are creative and fun to explore, with lots of nooks and crannies. But where <em>Windblown</em> really shines is its multiplayer — until playing the game, I had no idea <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer">how good roguelikes could be with friends</a>. Like <em>Hades</em>, <em>Windblown</em> is also in early access, so I’m expecting to play it a lot more next year as Motion Twin makes major updates.</p><p>And those are just the new roguelikes I’ve actually been able to put time into this year. There are still a bunch more that I want to play or have barely touched that seem extremely promising. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> got <em>two</em> major crossover DLCs that I want to dig into: one with <em>Contra</em> and one with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275710/vampire-survivors-ode-to-castlevania-dlc-konami-collaboration-expansion"><em>Castlevania</em></a>. (I’ve only played a couple rounds of the <em>Castlevania</em> expansion, and I was tickled at just how large the map was.) And while I’m talking about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>: <em>Halls of Torment</em>, which is kind of like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> mixed with an old-school <em>Diablo</em> aesthetic, left early access, and I want to check out what’s changed since I first dabbled in it last year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172102/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-steam-early-access-impression"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, a roguelike take on classic <em>Prince of Persia</em> action and platforming, is an example of how big publishers like Ubisoft are jumping into the genre — and it seems like something that’s right up my alley. <em>Rogue</em> is another early access roguelike on this list, but it’s gotten a bunch of big updates since its May launch, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296619/the-prince-wont-be-purple">significant update in November</a> that revamped the art style and added new biomes, bosses, and more. I should also mention that <em>Rogue</em> <em>also</em> has a <em>Dead Cells</em> connection: it’s made by Evil Empire, the studio that worked on many <em>Dead Cells</em> updates and DLCs, which gives me a lot of faith that they’ll do a great job shepherding the game to its eventual full launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Heck, 2024 has been such a banner year for roguelikes that even the 2014 classic <em>The</em> <em>Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em> got a significant new DLC update that <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F250900%2Fview%2F7119722540407193807">added online multiplayer</a>.</p><p>The sheer amount of great roguelikes <em>just this year</em> shows that the framework of the genre offers a lot of ways to make interesting games. I particularly appreciate how they’re generally more digestible than blockbuster epics. Next year has some promising roguelikes like <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> and <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, but I know I’ll be returning to a lot of 2024’s excellent roguelikes over and over again — well, after just one more round of <em>Balatro</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was another lowkey great year for what is increasingly becoming the default high-end gaming console. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There were excellent updates to the PS5 home screen UI, a slew of great exclusive games from second- and third-party partners, and an entire update to the console in the form of the $700 PS5 Pro. PS VR2 became platform agnostic, a 30th Anniversary celebration unveiled nostalgic accessories for longtime fans, and the base tier of PS Plus  continued to deliver plenty of premium freebies. The lack of a new big-budget first-party game and the abysmal failure of <em>Concord</em> sent up red flags, but not major hurdles to a platform that soared to 65.5 million units sold last month.</p><p>All of this as an executive shakeup saw Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan replaced by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ceo-ps5-spring-2024-showcase-1851474530?_gl=1*1od6znf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTk0NzA4LjQ4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ceo-ps5-spring-2024-showcase-1851474530?_gl=1*1od6znf*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDk5MDMwNi4xNjUuMS4xNzM0OTk0NzA4LjQ4LjAuMA..">co-CEOs Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino</a></span>, reporting up to Sony COO Hiroki Totoki.

The next phase of PlayStation is coming, and 2024 showed that even seeming “off years” can still deliver for players in spades.</p><h2 id="h157"><a id=""></a>The Hardware</h2><p>After tons of reporting, rumors, and speculation, 2024 was the year Sony finally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched the PS5 Pro</a></span>. Its hefty price tag promised no-compromises gaming, with upscaled 4K resolution at 60fps thanks to a more powerful GPU and new machine learning technology called PSSR. The results so far have been good to mixed, with some games looking more gorgeous than ever while certain third-party releases struggle to play nice with PSSR and studios race to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-ps5-pro-pssr-hotfix-turn-off-1851717966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-pandora-ps5-pro-pssr-hotfix-turn-off-1851717966">amend their PS5 Pro updates</a></span> in the face of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776">unexpected visual downgrades</a></span>. </p><p>This has put the device, at least early on, firmly into the “nice but unnecessary” category of upgrades. Denser visual detail at higher framerates and greater ray-tracing options bring the PS5 console experience into closer parity with mid-level PC gaming, but don’t quite offer the “oh shit!” moments that might make even longtime fans feel the need to run out and immediately pick one up. That’s especially the case when even the base PS5 continues to perform so well and feel perfectly adequate in the near-term.</p><figure id="" data-id="0d4efa6a42876bb96d9a1cc0ba35de47" data-recommend-id="image://0d4efa6a42876bb96d9a1cc0ba35de47" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="30th anniversary PS5 consoles and accessories are lined up.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This could be another indication that the console arms race is slowing to a crawl, with future generations yielding even more granular improvements. But the PS5 Pro’s PSSR tech also provides a glimpse at where console manufacturers could leverage AI to try to make up ground. Sony recently announced a partnership with AMD <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMwXJsMfIQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called Project Amethyst</a></span> to “support broad work and machine learning across a variety of devices” in an effort that would pay dividends for other companies as well. The company is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">reportedly already</a></span> working with AMD on the PS6.</p><p>For now, the PS5 still isn’t getting a price drop. In fact, it actually became more expensive this year in certain regions, including Japan. The DualSense controller also received a stealth price hike. A temporary Black Friday sale took the PS5 all-digital price down to $375, only $25 less than what it launched at in 2020. The PS5 got better in 2024, but not cheaper. </p><h2 id="h158"><a id=""></a>The Software</h2><p>The PS5 interface received a notable refresh this year in the form of a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1836798946095538399/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customizable welcome hub</a></span>. The default module when you start up the console comes with new backgrounds and a bunch of tiles that can be swapped in with various widgets, from trophies and controller battery life to news about wishlisted games, console storage, and who’s online. It’s a seemingly small touch that goes a long way toward making the PS5 ecosystem easier to parse, navigate, and engage with, and it might just be the start of a bold new era for the system’s UI.</p><p>There were a few other updates to the firmware in 2024. Adaptive charging made the console more energy-efficient for newer PS5 models, including the Slim and Pro, and party share now lets you circulate session invites directly on social media and other messaging apps. There’s still no great way to directly share screenshots and gameplay footage on social media after Sony cut integration with X (formerly known as Twitter), though the PlayStation App is getting closer to being the remote second screen for the PS5 it deserves to be.</p><p>But the biggest software update of all this year didn’t come to the PS5 at all—it came to the PlayStation Portal. The not-quite-a-gaming-handheld peripheral can now play a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">growing list of games directly from the cloud</a></span> rather than needing to stream them from a home console strictly as a remote play device. This change essentially doubles the value of the $200 accessory, and potentially serves as a bridge to a future in which a full-fledged Sony handheld <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">reportedly in development</a></span> can play new games natively as well.  </p><h2 id="h159"><a id=""></a>The Networks and Services</h2><p>This portion of our annual PlayStation report card usually focuses almost exclusively on the services portion of the equation, but 2024 showcased some significant lapses in network functionality. While it still pales in comparison to the infamous 2011 PSN outage, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-network-slowly-coming-back-online-after-significant-outage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-network-slowly-coming-back-online-after-significant-outage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the services were down intermittently for almost a full day back in the fall</a></span>. It was a reminder of how much of the platform relies on constant connectivity to deliver on its promise, from multiplayer-only games to always-online single-player campaigns.

Coupled with issues with activity cards and various high-profile firmware bugs, the normally quite stable PS5 platform wobbled more than usual in 2024. PS Plus’ Netflix-like library of downloadable games was on much firmer footing, however. </p><figure id="" data-id="dcd3fbe90f91cd6ad5aa51b1fd5a0c51" data-recommend-id="image://dcd3fbe90f91cd6ad5aa51b1fd5a0c51" data-format="png" data-width="1703" data-height="733" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows new PS Classics.

Subscribing fans finally got access to the <em>Sly Cooper</em> trilogy, the first two <em>Legacy of Kain</em> games, <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and a bunch of other old-school favorites. For the program’s price, though, there still really needs to be a better alternative for accessing the vast reservoir of PS3 exclusives. Insomniac’s WW2 alien shooter trilogy <em>Resistance</em> also arrived on Premium, but only via streaming.</p><p>And while the middle tier—PS Plus Extra—continues to be hit-or-miss with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-games-leaving-horizon-forbidden-west-marvel-ps5-1851626853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-games-leaving-horizon-forbidden-west-marvel-ps5-1851626853">what great games are added or rotated out</a></span>, the base PS Plus catalog continues to be full of bangers. 2024 saw the addition of <em>A Plague Tale: Requiem</em>, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em>, <em>Immortals of Aveum</em>, <em>Tunic</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, <em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <em>Little Nightmares II</em>, and the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, just to name a few. At the same time, we’ve gotten fewer and fewer high-profile day-one PS Plus releases.<em> Animal Well</em> was a GOTY contender but <em>Foamstars </em>and <em>Quidditch Champions</em> were both duds. Still, the cumulative library competes with the best of what Extra has and offers a great way to catch up on many of the best games of recent years. </p><h2 id="h160"><a id=""></a>The Games</h2><p>Sony’s impressive first-party studios mostly took a backseat in 2024 with two important exceptions:<em> Astro Bot</em> and <em>Concord</em>.

The mix of action adventure, open world, RPG, and survival horror went a long way to rounding out an otherwise sparser release calendar compared to the post-covid high-water mark set by 2023. Xbox’s multiplatform strategy also saw critically acclaimed hits like <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>and <em>Pentiment </em>arrive on PS5 alongside multiplayer juggernaut<em> Sea of Thieves</em> and the open-world survival sim <em>Grounded</em>. and the biggest 2024 game that wasn’t available on PS5, <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, will still arrive their early next year.</p><p>The PS5 might be heading into the latter stage of its lifecycle, but it feels like the best years are still in front of it.

			<p>Now that we are mere days from 2025, GTA 6 is starting to materialize as the proverbial elephant in the room, something that nobody in the gaming industry will be able to ignore one way or the other when <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it ships next Fall</a>.</p>
<p>Rockstar owner Take-Two is certainly eager to repeat the success of Grand Theft Auto 5, which became the second best-selling game of all time after Minecraft with <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 200 million units sold</a>. CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke a bit about the next Grand Theft Auto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a video interview with Conner Mather</a>, hyping it up with a single sentence:</p>
<p><em>I would say I think it'll be extraordinary and worth waiting for.</em></p>
<p>Later in the chat, Zelnick spoke in more general terms about the GTA community's feedback, and he seemed to hint that Rockstar has prepared features and content the fans might not even have dreamed of for GTA 6.</p>
<p><em>We definitely listen to feedback from our fans, absolutely. You need to, in our business, and you're able to. But remember, the biggest hits are always the ones that are unexpected. Everything that we do has to be new and different, not derivative. So, by definition when people are commenting on something that is in the market, that means they're looking at something that was done before. Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about, like, you thought you were anticipating this thing, but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of.</em></p>
<p>Looking back at GTA 5 and GTA Online (which just got <a href="https://wccftech.com/festive-events-make-a-return-to-gta-online-through-january-1-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update for the Holidays</a>), Zelnick revealed that Take-Two never thought the game would sell this much or that the Online mode would get more popular. In fact, it wasn't even going to have a virtual currency in the original plans.</p>
<p><em>I don't think any of us did. I think that we saw it as a really interesting add-on to the title. We actually originally had not planned to have virtual currency in the game, so it wasn't going to be an economic driver. It was relatively late in the day when we decided to pursue virtual currency because it was so long ago - we're looking back to 2013. And it wasn't an immediate success. You may recall it was pretty buggy at first. We had some trouble coming out of the gate because it was all new, and we were innovating; we were doing it all in real-time.&nbsp;It was like building a plane while you're taking off and then flying. It is an incredible, durable success and it continues to to perform many, many years later. It's astonishing and no, I don't think any of us expected that, but we also didn't expect to sell 205 million units. We never expected that. That was way outside of the realm of anything we contemplated.</em></p>

<p>Ubisoft has had a torrid 2024, facing one low after another. While the company is looking to reform itself moving forward, I want to take some time to look back on one of the company’s biggest shining lights few people are talking about—despite it being one of the games of the year.</p>



<p>Where do I even begin with Ubisoft’s wretched 2024? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Low Morale and internal struggles</a> kicked off the turbulent year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division Heartland</a> became one of several project casualties, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> began to happen behind the scenes, and the long-time-in-development XDefiant announced it was already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down</a> within a year of its launch. </p>



<p>To be honest, this barely scratches the surface of the last 12 months for one of the most famous game studios in the world. However, a ray of light shone on this dark cloud; a beaming beacon of hope that a credible game studio lies dormant behind its cookie-cutter RPGs and by-the-numbers sequels.</p>



<p>I’m talking about Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-lost-crown-is-lost-amongst-the-shuffle">The Lost Crown is Lost Amongst the Shuffle</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fluid and nearly flawless. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll admit, I barely paid much attention to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown when it was announced. Whisper it, but I only remembered it existed a handful of weeks out from release. The Lost Crown looked like a decent Metroidvania clone on the surface, and I had one clear thought as its debut drew near—where the hell is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>?</p>



<p>However, after 10-15 hours with The Lost Crown, I was forced to eat my words and tuck my tail between my legs. I was suddenly less eager for a Sands of Time Remake, and <strong>far more keen for The Lost Crown to get a sequel</strong>. This drastic turn of events was propagated by some of the silliest and smoothest gameplay I’ve ever played in a Metroidvania title.</p>



<p>Sargon heads up The Lost Crown, and he has personality and life. The world around him is a stunning palette of cel-shaded visuals and distinct biomes. It feels innovative and refined, and there were times <strong>I was genuinely questioning if this was a Ubisoft game</strong>. The same studio planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Assassin’s Creed games every year for the next 10</a>. The same studio still pushing the dead concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-another-push-into-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFTs</a> deep into 2024.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown’s 86 rating on Metacritic</a> is a testament to the game’s brilliance. It was crowned champion of “Innovation in Accessibility” at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and was rightfully nominated for “Best Action/Adventure Game.” Recency bias may have hurt The Lost Crown’s chances of more awards and wins, but make no mistake, this was the highlight of Ubisoft’s year. As Linkin Park says though: “In the end, it doesn’t even matter.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-sequel-is-probably-buried-in-the-sand">A Sequel is Probably Buried in the Sand</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more game, please. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>We exclusively reported on Oct. 23, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia devs were being moved to different projects at Ubisoft</a>. The reason is twofold: To aid the progress of other titles, and because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-management-to-blame-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sales-issues-baldurs-gate-3-exec-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lost Crown’s disappointing sales</a>—a recurring theme for Ubisoft throughout 2024.</p>



<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown reportedly sold in the region of one million copies. This was far below Ubisoft’s lofty expectations and has me questioning Ubisoft’s targets and wondering if they’re overinflated—but this is for another time. For now, <strong>don’t expect a sequel anytime soon</strong>, with the sad reality being this is a one-and-done type of deal.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-reveals-why-the-game-was-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadow delay to improve its quality</a> and reported changes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7 and its gameplay formula</a> sounds like the winds of change to me. It feels like 2025 is a crucial year for the French company to get back on track, alter its perception, and rewrite the narrative moving forward.</p>



<p>If we never end up getting a sequel to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, I’ll still remember it fondly. Ubisoft took a chance on it, and it was a success in the eyes of players. If you get time, I’d highly recommend checking out this little gem, and maybe one day it’ll become popular enough to become embroiled in its own remake development hell.</p>



<hr>



<p>Have you had a chance to play The Lost Crown? Did you think it was Ubisoft’s best effort of the year? Does it deserve a chance to hog the spotlight with a sequel? Share your thoughts below as I’m keen to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>There were a lot of games that came out of nowhere to become smash hits in 2024. Across all genres and scale, some games just grabbed fans in ways that we weren’t expecting. But no game stood out more than Helldivers 2 from Arrowhead Game Studios.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, a vote was held to determine what you, our readers, thought was the biggest surprise of 2024 in gaming. With a number of great games to choose from, it turned out to be the closest vote of the six categories we had this year with Helldivers 2 and second-place Balatro being separated by just 3% of the votes.</p>



<p>But what made Helldivers 2 so surprising and special to the players?</p>



<p>The game was nearly a decade in the making and was a complete change up from the twin-stick shooter gameplay of the original. When it finally released in February, Helldivers 2 burst onto the scene with nearly 500,000 concurrent players on Steam and even more on PlayStation 5. The launch was so successful that developer Arrowhead Game Studios had to hire more staff to work on the game’s servers just to keep them online and functional.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s launch showed what could happen with a game-as-a-service when it’s released properly. Not only is the gameplay fun, but the lore that was developed, the story being told, and connection being forged by the community made for an experience many players hadn’t felt in quite some time. To add to it, it felt like those building the game actually had a passion for what they were creating and putting out.</p>



<p>Of course, the game has had its fair share of hiccups since the fast launch, and its player numbers have fallen a bit. But it’s still one of the most popular games on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> daily, and should only stay strong as more is added for players.</p>



<p>What do you think was the biggest surprise gaming hit of 2024? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>How many games did you play in 2024? With so many new and hit releases, many of which took us by surprise, it was tough to keep up with the slew of new games launching month after month. We tried, though. Thankfully, it’s a bit easier to pick and choose what to play if you sort by the highest-rated titles of the year, according to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a>. There are a few titles in here that you’d expect, and a few I’m even surprised by, like UFO 50 and Thank Goodness You’re Here!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-highest-rated-games-of-the-year">What Are the Highest Rated Games of the Year?</h2>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mention-titles-we-recommend">Honorable Mention Titles We Recommend</h2>



<p>Of course, the top 20 is all well and good, but it’s not a comprehensive list of the best games of the year. That list extends far beyond what most people are willing to read online, so let us offer a few runner-up suggestions that still deserve your attention:</p>

		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>Whether this is a religious holiday for you or not, here’s hoping that you’re able to gather together with family and maybe a few friends, sharing time and merriment with as many of the loved ones in your life as possible over the next few days. Gifts will be exchanged, families with young children will have those flurries of chaotic excitement as wrapping paper is torn apart, and more than a few sweets and little tipples to fill the wait for Christmas Dinner!</p>
<p>So, on&nbsp;behalf of all the writers here at TheSixthAxis, I want to wish you, your families and your friends Happy Holidays and a very Merry Christmas!</p>
<hr>
<p>2024 has been another one of those years filled with challenges for many people and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With wars still raging in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we hope for peace and resolution, and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>
<p>These hopes might be fruitless , but if you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>

<p>While Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, if you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support. You can reach them via the above links or at the following numbers:</p>

<p>Move aside AAA games, it’s time to recognize the lesser-known, not-as-well-funded titles this year. The best 2024 indie titles have delivered immeasurably, with one, in particular, achieving GOTY talk—so let’s go through the contenders and our winner.</p>



<p>Indie games can’t die. While the big-time developers and publishers push big-budget, large-scale-production blockbusters, the lifeblood of indies mustn’t dry up. For every copy-and-paste open-world game, someone has the vision to turn a crab into a soulslike superstar, or have you complete odd jobs in a bizarre English town.</p>



<p>The best indie games of 2024 have all shown ingenuity, and proven they can hang with the big boys, and every nomination on this list deserves to be played.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-title-of-2024-winner-balatro">Best Indie Title of 2024 Winner — Balatro</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You might have guessed it. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p>Poker has been around since the 1800s, but I’m sure its creator didn’t think to combine the card game with intricate roguelike mechanics to create an infinitely replayable breakout hit that would go toe-to-toe with multi-million projects for the GOTY crown. This is what LocalThunk have been able to achieve with Balatro.</p>



<p>Balatro starts you off with a traditional deck of 52 cards comprised of four suits going from Ace to King. The format of the game revolves around you beating increasingly tougher decks requiring higher point totals achieved with high-scoring poker hands. Balatro is a basic poker game at its atomic level, but if we break down its complexities, it’s so much more than this.</p>



<p>You can buy Jokers to add devious and cunning modifiers to your deck—increasing the points earned—allowing us to overcome harder “Blinds.” The roguelike loop means failing is encouraged because you learn the intricacies of the mechanics and understand hands and scoring better. Plus, who can resist one “final” run?</p>



<p>Balatro’s impact in 2024 is tangible. It’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year nominee</a>, already won the Indie Game of the Year award at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2024-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Joystick Awards</a>, and sold well over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-2-million-units-sold-major-gameplay-update-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two million copies</a>. Balatro is a simple idea executed flawlessly, and it’s a worthy recipient of our Best Indie Title of 2024 award.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Indie Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>Balatro has us all in, yes, but we haven’t revealed our full hand yet. If you’re tired of the monotony of mainstream gaming, 2024 has produced some whoppers in the indie game category.</p>



<h3 id="h-animal-well">Animal Well</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unnerving. Credit to Shared Memory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Animal Well makes me uncomfortable from start to finish: The sound design, the enemies, the edgy and retro-inspired visuals—and I love it. It’s a basic, 2D Metroidvania adventure relying on backtracking and memorization to progress, but its array of items and delicate world-building make the journey seamless.</p>



<p>The mini-boss encounters are low-key terrifying, the puzzles are logical and lucid, and the sense of progression is satisfying. I took umbrage with the map which becomes intensely layered and obfuscated the greater it unravels, and the platforming can be a bit floaty. Animal Well was developed by a single person, and this fact alone turns my mind to mush. If you have a weekend to spare, I implore you to check this out as it pushed Balatro close.</p>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I can’t wait until this is finished. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hades is on my Mt. Rushmore of roguelike entries—and it could be all four heads, honestly. Saying goodbye to Zagreus and making merry with Melinoë is tough, but within the first hour, I was saying Zagreus who? The Princess of the Underworld is just as engaging as her brother, and Supergiant Games has pretty much reinvented the Hades universe. New weapons, abilities, and a curious underground and surface mechanic are some of the new additions to the roguelike formula as you battle through brand-new, enemy-filled biomes.</p>



<p>Predictably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-the-hades-2-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> misses out because it’s not finished yet. 2024 is only the beginning of the Hades 2 adventure, testing the soul-filled waters of the Underworld with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-ii-early-access-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>. Its full release is looking likely for 2025, and there’s every chance this sequel can go one better than a nomination next year.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-kitty-big-city">Little Kitty, Big City</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Honestly, the cat alone could’ve won this. Credit to Double Dagger Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let me preface, I’m a cat person. I’ve owned cats before, and I own cats now. They are the greatest creatures walking the Earth, and I care for them more than most humans. Little Kitty, Big City appeals to the cat connoisseur in me, and everything our purring protagonist does causes me to unconsciously let slip a squeak. Little Kitty, Big City’s charming appeal is letting you be a cat: You nom bread, carelessly walk into people to knock them over, use random objects as scratching posts, and there’s a dedicated meow button—à la Stray.</p>



<p>Its cutesy nature aside, Little Kitty, Big City is a self-contained open-world platformer. The world itself isn’t gigantic, but has lots of depth and verticality. You’re encouraged to explore, find fun side missions, and claim collectibles. It’s not genre-defining, it’s fairly predictable and can be completed in one sitting. Nevertheless, it’s a lot of fun and whiskers away from being a-meowzing.</p>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What a visual. Credit to Pocket Pair</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Pokémon with guns” there, I said it, I said <em>the </em>line. Palworld has been associated with Pokémon since day one, although it’s not hard to understand the comparison. Pocket Pair’s creature-collecting, monster-battling open-world title has a deep Paldeck full of weird and wonderful specimens to fight and befriend. Once you do this, you assign them to various work jobs: Kindling, Lumbering, Transporting, and other labor-intensive tasks—there might be an RSPCA issue here.</p>



<p>The big headline grabbers are the ability to shoot Pals, have them shoot other people, butcher Pals, and even capture humans. Blatant murder and human trafficking aside, Palworld is an extremely diverse RPG. Hopefully, it comes through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo-Palworld lawsuits</a> unscathed and adds to its Early Access build—as this is still a game very much in progress and lacking a bit of depth.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Most mornings, I stumble out of bed, grab my phone, and crack open some Pokemon packs. Over the last month, I've been consumed by the routine of booting up Pokemon TCG Pocket, a mobile adaptation of the popular card game, and--much like the video games and show encourage--catching 'em all. I've blown through dozens of booster packs by now chasing the thrill of filling my digital library with rare holographic and full-art cards. I know for a fact I'm not alone in this craze, either. Group chats of mine are filled with friends sharing the rewards of their booster packs, and my social media feeds often consist of a handful of screenshots of someone's haul. That's not all that I've seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Everywhere I looked this year, some kind of card game was killing it and dominating conversations and minds. Balatro grabbed a hold of gamers early into the year and never particularly let go. My favorite part of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth wasn't taking Tifa on a date or watching Nomura and company continue to reinterpret FF7's mythos; it was taking a break from the bloated open world and throwing down the gauntlet in games of Queen's Blood, a territory-based card game within the expansive RPG, and I wasn't the only one who fell in love with it. Everyone I know now plays Magic: The Gathering, and after numerous alluring crossovers and bids from friends, I do too. And by the very end of the year, Pokemon TCG Pocket became a part of all of our day-to-day lives, allowing us to chase the thrilling feeling of filling a digital library with some of our favorite creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">The point is: In 2024, we proverbially bet big on card games. We went all in, so to speak, and it's fascinating to wonder why this trend has picked up so much steam in recent years. These games vary in complexity and mechanics, but are there some underlying qualities that unify all these examples and make sense of the incredible year that they've enjoyed?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418892"></a><figcaption>Balatro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, I think a lot of us have just been craving something simpler, and most of the aforementioned games certainly fit the bill. Balatro is, as its tagline suggests, Solitaire by way of Poker, a combination of one of oldest genres and one of the most widely played games of all time. Strip away the multipliers, the infectious music, and the booster packs (which are purchased with in-game money, not microtransactions), and it is a deceptively simple concept: produce winning hands like straights and flushes while meeting increasingly ludicrous demands and score totals. There are obviously mechanical and aesthetic flourishes which complicate matters, like the presence of game-altering jokers and a roguelike framework that appears to allow for endless play, but it really is a game to idly play for hours because, when broken down, it is as easy to understand as 1, 2, 3.</p><p dir="ltr">To a certain degree, you can play a lot of these games, which mostly boast easy-to-understand rulesets and formats, on auto-pilot. I can recognize a flush and quickly finish a round of Balatro with nary a thought in a crowded airport. Pokemon TCG Pocket actually features an auto-battle feature, in case you are mostly in it for the little guys rather than the dueling. Queen's Blood eventually becomes a much more complicated game if you follow its questline to the very end, but otherwise it's a pretty straightforward game of terrain conquest and making numbers go up. It's refreshing to take a break from world-ending plots, menus upon menus, and consequential decisions to slip back into something more comforting, and that's what these card games often have been. It was as true for Triple Triad and Gwent as it is for countless of these modern examples, and the fact that the trend has persisted for so long suggests that players definitely have an appetite for them.</p><p dir="ltr">In cases where there's an undeniable level of complexity though, like with Magic: The Gathering and even high-level play of the aforementioned games, there's something else entirely that seems to bring players into the fold, and I know it's definitely been true for me.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a social aspect to card games that shouldn't be discounted. The biggest reason that I've been turned onto them of late is that everyone around me is doing something with them. Many of my closest friends have been buying Pokemon booster packs and collecting them for several months or years now. My roommate began having friends over to play matches of Magic: The Gathering's Commander format at our dining-room table for hours on end. For months on end, I've watched from the outside as folks fell madly in love with Balatro's blend of poker and roguelike mechanics, committed to runs composed of ridiculous power-ups and multipliers, and forged challenges to issue others.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418893"></a><figcaption>TCG Card Shop Simulator</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>As someone who tends to play games in solitude, or at the very least with a very select few, I looked to my colleagues and friends adopting these card games and building new rituals amongst each other and wanted in on the sense of community they were building up. I wanted to delight in the joy of awesome new rare card art with others. I wanted to try out something new in spaces filled with people I trusted. I wanted to be where the people were, and if that meant huddling around a table in person and learning the convoluted rules of new games, then so be it. Hell, even this very experience that I'm detailing was adapted to a game called TCG Card Shop Simulator, and that game did gangbusters, proving to me that I'm not alone in wanting these communal spaces that card games are so uniquely good at fostering.</span></p><p dir="ltr">I learned to love card games over middle-school lunches. Growing up, I collected cards aplenty, but I never bothered learning their rules and functions. It was regular bouts of Yu-Gi-Oh at lunchtime that first gave me a real appetite for card games. That and a youth spent playing Solitaire. Even then, they were a break from talk of Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, or whatever monstrously large RPG was the game du jour. And even then, it gave me an opportunity to sit around and really connect with people. Years later, I'm picking them back up for so many of the same reasons, and it leaves me wondering if everyone else is too?</p><p dir="ltr">What's most exciting is that this card fever isn't going anywhere. Slay the Spire 2 is on the horizon, and if that first game was any indication, it's going to be one of the biggest games of 2025. Balatro has spent the year adding card collections themed around other games, dubbing these crossovers "Friends of Jimbo," and I'm sure there are many more to come. Riot Games just recently announced that it's expanding its League of Legends transmedia push into the realm of trading cards, and I'm sure there's even more in the works. Whether it was digitally or physically, it's hard to deny that card games have enjoyed a great deal of success this year, and it looks primed to spill over into the next.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>Let’s be honest: 2024 was an exceptional year for video games. We had titles such as Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Balatro, Astro Bot, The Outlast Trials, UFO 50, Animal Well, and many others to consider. It’s a bit much, honestly. Well, it appears 2025 is keeping up the momentum, as straight off the bat, the video game releases in January 2025 aim to come out swinging!</p>

			<p>2024 saw the release of some absolutely fantastic indie games spanning a variety of genres. Indie games are where unique ideas flourish and bring something new and exciting to the table. This year saw some amazing indie games that even went on to win awards across a multitude of categories, speaking plainly for their excellence.</p>
<p>Here are all of the titles we've picked for Wccftech's best indie games of 2024. Truly, we were spoiled for choice. As usual, make sure to check out the other lists as they are released on the website to see what games came out on top this year.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>UFO 50</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ufo-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFO 50</a> is the third title to be made by Mossmouth, the creator of Spelunky. This game was released in September of this year and even received a 91 on Metacritic, with a User Score of 7.7. When it comes to scores, this is pretty darn fantastic. For those who haven't yet played the game, UFO 50 is a collection of fun and vibrant games that can be played single-player or multiplayer. They span a variety of genres, from shoot-em-ups, puzzlers and platformers. The goal with this game was to replicate the nostalgic feeling of an 8-bit aesthetic, and they did just that.</p>

<h2>Animal Well (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-well-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Animal Well was a surprising release this year, but a widely successful one at that. This title was made by a single developer and was published by Bigmode, a YouTuber videogamedunkey's publishing company, with his wife, Leah. This wacky game went on to perform incredibly well, with vibrant and surreal aesthetics as you explore an interconnected labyrinth, collect items and platforms, and do your best to survive. Below is an excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's review.</p>
<p><em>For such a tiny pixelated world, Animal Well is overflowing with secrets. Merely acquiring a new upgrade tool opens the floodgates of possibilities for exploration. As players explore the depths of the well, one of the recurring collectibles to discover comes by way of eggs, of which there are 64 in total to collect. Collecting certain thresholds of eggs rewards the player with various new tools, including the ability to leave hint stamps or draw lines on the in-game map. If it weren’t for these tools, I probably would have been at a loss for some of these eggs where I could see something clearly amiss in the room that I didn’t have the correct tool for at the time.&nbsp;</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Balatro</h2>
<p>Balatro has taken the world by storm. Even for people who have never played a game of poker in their lives, this has become a favorite for many people across the globe. It's widely accessible on every platform and serves as a great time sink. This game has been so successful that it even went on to win multiple awards at The Game Awards this year, with a nomination for Game of the Year, which is a huge achievement for an indie game.</p>
<p>Balatro was released in February this year, and it doesn't seem that there is any sign of it slowing down any time soon. People continue to play it, and the developer continues to add fun aesthetic updates to the game, with plans for other add-ons in the future. Looking at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Metacritic scores</a>, Balatro received a score of 90, with a User Score of 8.2.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Hades II</h2>
<p>Hades was a huge success when it was released, and saw a lot of people fall in love with Greek Mythology via a video game. Hades II is no different. This highly anticipated sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on Early Access in May and has been widely successful since its release. The game has already seen a ton of updates and content added to the game to help flesh it out, and it's well on its way to being a fully-fledged product. Instead of playing as Zagreus in this title, players get to experience the life and story of Melinoe, Zag's sister. It features a cast of different Gods and Goddesses to interact with, different weaponry, and much more.</p>
<p>Hades II was also on our highly anticipated indie games of 2024 list released last year, and it certainly hasn't disappointed thus far.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Thank Goodness You're Here!</h2>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here is such a peculiar game and is perfect for those who are looking for a comedic experience in their game. Released in August this year, Thank Goodness You're Here is a comedic slapformer, set in Northern England. The game is fully voiced, and features some iconic voice actors in the game to help set the tone.</p>
<p>This title received a 90 on Metacritic from critic reviews and a 7.6 User Score. While the game may not be for everyone, it's a pretty surreal experience and provides some great laughs when you need them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[On Your Tail Preview - A Wholesome Whodunit]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/on-your-tail-preview-wholesome-whodunit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/on-your-tail-preview-a-wholesome-whodunit.1068783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/on-your-tail-preview-wholesome-whodunit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've always loved detective novels. <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, Agatha Christie's <em>Poirot</em>, and <em>Nancy Drew</em> all gave me a intense interest in whodunits. When presented the opportunity to play through the first two acts of indie puzzle and whodunit&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail</em>, I hopped at the chance. After diving in and exploring what Borgo Marina has to offer, I can confidently say that&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail</em>&nbsp;is more than just a whodunit game.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail</em>, you play as Diana, a writer looking for inspiration after a bad review of her work. Heading to Borgo Marina, she ends up investigating a series of thefts across the village. The whole game is super cozy, and the town is filled with, mostly, nice people that you end up helping. Even the crimes aren't that bad; a theft without taking something, a cheap item stolen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main gameplay involves collecting clues, putting them in the correct sequence based on witnesses, and conducting interrogations. Investigations get harder as the game progresses by adding in more clues and increasing the complexity of events. The story never has a chance to get dull or go stale.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/on-your-tail-dnd-reference-video-store.jpg?itok=uHdSZXuz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/on-your-tail-dnd-reference-video-store.jpg?itok=qPNMh2-4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The increasing complexity is where the investigations shine. Not only are the clues different each time there's a crime, but putting together the sequence of events is also different. Sometimes you need to talk to characters to gather information, other times it's finding items that have moved, or even a chicken in a hat. The variations in each investigation keep the game fresh, even though the mechanics are the same. I never got bored with the story or progressing through it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with investigations and interrogations, there are multiple minigames, jobs, riddles, and relationship quests to complete. Fishing, Cooking, Marbles, Skipping Stones, and solving riddles can be done throughout town and on the beach. You can go boating or earn money with three different jobs. There are shops to buy books, movies, and clothes. It's not just a crime-solving puzzle game, but also a life simulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gelato job requires you to collect ingredients from around town to create new flavors to sell. Being a waitress is similar to a restaurant simulation. Delivering mail introduces you to the various characters of Borgo Marina and is one of the quickest ways to earn large amounts of money. Marbles and Skipping Stones can be played alone or with a companion. Time doesn't move throughout the day until certain objectives are met, so you can relax and explore everything without worry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some bugs did rear their ugly head while I was playing, specifically when attempting the cooking mini game. The game would softlock after losing a life, resulting in my having to close it through the Steam overlay.&nbsp;This happened any time I tried to cook, especially coffee, which is horrid since making coffee for Paun is one of the friendship quests you get.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also lag, swimming back to shore doesn't let you turn around and you swim until you're a decent amount on the beach, and some clipping. These are smaller issues that don't really effect the game in a serious way, but still impact the experience.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/on-your-tail-gelato-job.jpg?itok=RlU9ra4F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/on-your-tail-gelato-job.jpg?itok=uZVwmVyr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of that, a lot of the minigames, how to answer riddles found around Borgo Marina, and how to harvest items don't come with the best, or any, explanation. Harvesting items requires you to press a button on every green segment, but you're never told that, causing you to lose out on a harvest for the day. Waitressing and working for Medeu are the best-explained minigame jobs, but still require playing the game to get a full grasp of what the tutorial was saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A general synopsis of how to solve a riddle, which is done using cards you've collected by meeting people, visiting areas of town, and solving investigations, would help players understand what they need to do to actually complete the task. The directions for Cooking are confusing, but since I couldn't actually get it to work, I can't say whether successfully making something shed any light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also descriptions that are still in Italian. While easy to understand, in general, a whole quest entry ends up being in Italian. This makes it a little difficult for those that don't read the language to know what they need to do. On top of that, ingredients are labeled that way when making gelato, which can become confusing if you don't have a reference for the item.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/on-your-tail-italian-quest-description.jpg?itok=U3O3EOOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/on-your-tail-italian-quest-description.jpg?itok=RK-2IQA3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While there are bugs and other items that need to be fixed, my biggest issue with&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail</em>&nbsp;is the camera sensitivity. When first loading in, the camera whipped around with the slightest movement. After reducing all sensitivity for the camera and movement to the lowest setting, I still would get a headache when running through Borgo Marina. I ended up needing to take more breaks than I usually would during a gaming session. This may not be an issue for others, though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I'd love to solve the rest of the mysteries in&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail</em>. It's a cozy way to exercise your brain and have fun, without the pressure of combat, equipment builds, or failure.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>On Your Tail</strong>&nbsp;was previewed on PC over 8 hours until the end of Act 2 with a code provided by Humble Games and Memorable Games. Screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-2024-video-games-you-should-replay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For many, the holiday season is the only time of the year they get off from work. It’s a chance to sit back on the couch, relax between chores around the house, and play a video game or two. You might even have time to beat one. If you’re on the fence about what to play, however, we can help. Here are the five best video game releases from 2024 worth replaying this holiday season!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-5-game-releases-worth-replaying-in-2024">Top 5 Game Releases Worth Replaying in 2024</h2>



<p>It was a big year in gaming, with too many new releases to count, and more than a handful of standout releases. If you were unable to keep up with all the new launches, or have a handful of favorites that you’d like to return to, this holiday season is a good time!</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or three-player co-op</a> play, many of us fully intend to return to the world of The Lands Between this holiday season. But more importantly, it’s an excellent time to dive into the expansion, which is absolutely massive and, in some cases, more challenging than the vanilla game.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut">Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s like Groundhog Day but more twisted. Slay the Princess is an existential horror game in which your dialogue choices change the course of the story across various timelines. Each world varies in some way, from a different setting to a different princess altogether, and your choices can either set off a chain of events that end the world or save everyone at a significant cost.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it didn’t fully stick its landing, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is still an exceptional RPG with so much depth and potential. There’s a lot to explore, from countless quests to mini-games to collectibles. It’ll eat up most of your vacation time, and you might finish it if you’re lucky, but now’s a good time to try before the third entry releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you only want to play one game this holiday season, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will eat up every second of your free time. It’s a massive, lengthy RPG featuring Ichiban Kasuga, the loveable underdog, and Kazuma Kiryu, the broken fighter, exploring a huge landscape with countless turn-based battles and memorable minigames to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s left to say about Balatro? It’s one of the more unique releases of the past year, focusing on roguelike deck-building and out-there poker mechanics that make for an enthralling experience. It’s one many were hoping would win Game of the Year, though Astro Bot beat it, as expected, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from sitting down for a hand or two or fourteen this holiday season!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[It’s OK To Have A Weird Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/christmas-holiday-pogues</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-ok-to-have-a-weird-christmas.1068756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/christmas-holiday-pogues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, my sister called me to ask what we did for Christmas as kids. We both had recollections of trees and presents when we were very little, but then our memories petered out. This was fine with us, but she lives in a world now that takes Christmas very seriously, and it seems like she always feels a bit out of step with the energy and traditions of her friends.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have many traditions myself these days. As I’ve mentioned before, I used to spend a lot of my holidays working as a dog walker, and in later years I’ve mostly happily spent them by myself. I’ve never felt the social pressure my sister does to make the holiday special, especially since she has kids. But I’m fascinated by people who have strong opinions on the holiday and how it should be spent, who can have a “good” or “bad” holiday based on whether they live up to some standards I’ve never been obligated to. What I’ve always liked best about this time of year is the sense of timelessness I move through as someone without the demands of family or tradition, swimming through these weeks when everyone is distracted and so no one wants or expects anything of me, where I can follow my own moods and make or cancel plans and everyone just chalks my inconsistency up to the chaos of the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>For a while, that unobserved space was just an excuse to get <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drunk</a>; I’ve spent more Christmases than I’d care to admit perched on a solitary bar stool. At the time I thought this was a romantic subversion of the idea that being alone at a bar on Christmas is a sad-sack sign of rock bottom; now that I’m sober I can see that it was in fact kinda sad, even if it didn’t feel sad at the time. So now I do other stuff with my time: I’ll often cook something ambitious. Sometimes I’ll watch every Christmas episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/bobs-burgers-has-some-nice-snow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bob’s Burgers</em></a> (a good tradition that you should also take up) while eating that food. This year I’m seeing some friends before going to visit my family.</p><p>There’s a lot of pressure to be happy on Christmas, or a certain different weight to any sadness you might feel compared to all the other days of the year. But I think there can also be something lovely about an off-kilter Christmas, a gently sad or maybe introspective or unremarkable one, or maybe one where you just have your normal feelings but they feel abnormal when compared to what you’re “supposed” to feel. What I was trying to capture with those drunk holidays, and what I now actually get to capture with my sober ones, is the reminder that there is no one way to live, no groove that everyone wears through life. I love how the day can be all bright lights and matching sweaters for some people, and for others it can be Chinese food and a movie, and for others it can be just a normal day, and for people like me it can be a day to think about how my days are spent and if I want to keep spending them that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the actual inspiration for this blog, which is to tell you about my friend <a href="https://www.anxietyshark.ca/and-the-bells-are-ringing-out-for-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niko Stratis’ blog</a>, whom I dared on Bluesky to rank how all the covers of The Pogues’ “Fairytale of New York” try to avoid singing some of the slurs in the 1987 song that aren’t appropriate today. Niko writes,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[“Fairytale of New York” is] a song of contrasts; this band as a collective gathering of rough hewn troubadours of heartache and drink, Shane MacGowan sees and sings to the dark corners of the barroom that many would rather avert their gaze [to] and this is an important piece in the puzzle that builds the tremendous vision of beauty that is “Fairytale of New York”. These two people at the centre, Irish Immigrants in a jail cell who once felt so much hope and promise now embittered by time and circumstance.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Pogues -  Fairytale Of New York (Official Video)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9jbdgZidu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Fairytale of New York” has become a kind of de facto Christmas classic, but it’s not one that you’d have soft-edged memories of singing around the piano. Niko dug through all the weird “haggard”s and “blagger”s and “maggot”s that replace the song’s most jarring slur, and while they gave me a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/3575851/viral-taggart-fairytale-new-york-suggestion-pc/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laugh</a> they also made me think about the the combination of beauty and pain that make the song so affecting, and make it feel so right for the complicated feelings of this season. It’s a beautiful song, but also a song full of mean, sad characters who wallow in their meanness and sadness before reaching for something different and gentle, something they ultimately fall short of but are still, by virtue of being (fictional) humans, entitled to want. In one way, rewriting the words is an effort to make the song live up to expectations that it so intentionally bucks, to turn it from a Pogues song into something you can play on the radio as part of the soundtrack to an idealized “perfect” holiday. In another way, by recognizing that Hozier and Ed Sheeran and an a capella choir shouldn’t say a slur, it’s a kind of growth that maybe unintentionally captures the clumsiness of growth. These ill-fitting rhymes are imperfect new traditions, messy improvements that fit right in with the song and its story and this whole time of year.</p><p>I hope I never have another drunk Christmas, but I’m always aware that I can’t say that for sure. Those bar stool holidays were a way of shining up my everyday drinking, and I can see in them now a yearning for a different feeling that I eventually found. This year has been far from perfect for me, and it’s hard to have hope that next year will be better. But a weird day, like a weird lyric, can be OK. If your holiday isn’t what you want it to be, I hope you can find a way to follow the call in that desire. But if it just isn’t what everyone is telling you it “should” be, I hope you can instead honor what it is. You can have a weird one this year, an ill-fitting rhyme or an out-of-step day, and a different one next year, or maybe just the same one that you feel differently about. You can try out new words. You can write another verse. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siltterhead-is-good-actually"><h3>Wait A Second, Slitterhead Rules</h3></a><p>Slitterhead is a beautiful PS3 game dropped through a time portal, and one of the most original games of the year.</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We spoke to them at length the day before the release about everything Sonic: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">Big the Cat</a>, their inspirations, whether or not Chaos are real... you know, the important questions.

The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, Casey and Miller reminded us that they're signed on to write a script for an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-executive-produce-it-takes-two-movie">It Takes Two film adaptation produced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, and also hinted that they were working on some other unannounced adaptations they couldn't talk about.

"Golden Axe was another good Genesis multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miller throws in A Boy and His Blob, and Casey responds with "the 7-Up game about the dot having a platforming adventure." He's referring to Cool Spot, a 1993 platformer starring the red dot from the 7-Up logo.

"I remember always when we played Wind Waker, we were always like, man, I mean, it would probably be weird if they made a Zelda movie to start with Wind Waker versus the more classic Hyrule. But we both loved Wind Waker and it's so cinematic. Yeah. So after they make this Zelda movie, I guess we're putting it out there in the world, maybe we can do a Wind Waker spin-off."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know much about Nintendo and Sony's partnership on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action">The Legend of Zelda movie</a>.

			<p>Roleplaying games are having a great year after year lately. 2023 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2023-incredible-tales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was absolutely stellar</a>, but 2024 is another year that will go into the genre's history books, not only because of the huge amount of RPGs released but for their quality as well. As such, this year, more than any other, it's really difficult to just pick five games over all the others, as the vast majority of roleplaying games released this year brought something interesting to the table, whether it was a new take on a classic formula, a faithfully remade classic or a new evolution of an established series.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a></em></p>
<h2>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">9.2</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Like-a-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The release of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was a watershed moment for the franchise created by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, doing away with some of the series' trademark features to join the roleplaying games genre. The features and mechanics introduced in the seventh main entry in the series blossomed in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, as the turn-based combat system and the class systems are better than ever, and they not only manage to make Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu's adventure all the more compelling and memorable but also the proper passing of the torch from the old protagonist to the new the game was conceived to be. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth serves as the real bridge between the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series into one cohesive experience. It’s the perfect sendoff for Kiryu and a passing of the torch to the plucky Ichiban Kasuga. In a lot of ways, Infinite Wealth builds upon the past with callbacks that series fans could appreciate. It’s a Japanese RPG experience that could only best be described as Ryu ga Gotoku Studio’s Metal Gear Solid 4 moment.</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">10</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following Final Fantasy VII Remake, which reimagined a fairly linear portion of the original game, there was some skepticism surrounding the second part of the Remake project, as attempting to replicate the huge scale of the Planet while also making it interesting was no easy feat. The development team, however, proved up to the task, delivering with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth an amazing game featuring huge open-world environments sporting a wealth of activities that spice up the experience and provide a distinct identity to each of the game's regions, an improved combat system leaning more into the action genre, and an incredible recreation of some of the game's well-known sequences with some twists that will be leaving fans speculating until the release of the third and final entry in the series. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;<a href="https://ffvii.square-enix-games.com/en-us/games/rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon's Dogma 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-showcase-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 promised to actually realize Hideaki Itsuno's concept for the original game, an RPG set in a believable living world where player actions, both big and small, would have consequences, and in plenty of ways, it did, only not in the scope that fans expected. As such, the game is"only" an enhanced version of the original featuring great visuals, a beautiful open world filled with optional secrets, an engaging combat system that better realizes the combination of character-action and Monster Hunter series mechanics, and some very interesting systems, including the devastating Dragonsplague mechanics, that is only a few small steps away from being the proper sequel that everyone was expecting it to be. Even so, it's very much worth being added in our top roleplaying games of 2024 list. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter different personal opinions, it is undeniable that in the past few years, BioWare ruinously fell from grace, going from releasing some all-time classics like Baldur's Gate, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the original Mass Effect trilogy to launching games like the average Mass Effect Andromeda and the failed live service game Anthem. As such, the studio had a lot to prove with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and prove it they did, going back to their roots, doing away with ill-fated open-world and live service pretensions to present a tighter mission-based experience featuring an excellent combat system and impressive customization depth that should please the vast majority of the modern RPG audience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Metaphor-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio caught the attention of roleplaying games fans since its announcement as Project Re: Fantasy back in 2016, but the long development team made more than a few fear that the combination of mechanics lifted from the Persona series and a fantasy setting wouldn't be working as well as most expected.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that was not the case, as Metaphor: ReFantazio is the first proper step forward for the formula introduced in the original Persona 3, rejuvenating it considerably while offering an engaging story and a compelling class system that gives players a lot of customization options. A dragging final part of the game is the only flaw of an experience that will hopefully blossom into a full-fledged franchise. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Those who harbor an innate distaste for the social systems and time limits of modern Persona titles will find no solace here, but those who are willing to embrace what very well could be the sixth Persona title in all but name alone will experience one of the most stylish Japanese roleplaying games of 2024.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/24/24328374/metaphor-refantanzio-battle-music-shoji-meguro-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantanzio</em></a> is one of 2024’s best games racking up a stack of Game Awards including best RPG, best art direction, and best narrative. But one category in which Metaphor particularly stood out was its music. The soundtrack, produced by Shoji Meguro – the long-time music director of the <em>Persona</em> series, is one of the outstanding achievements in video game music this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299700/flute-guy-japanese-monk-chant-guy-musical-nirvana">particularly its battle theme</a> which became a viral hit. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Meguro talked about his work on the <em>Metaphor</em> soundtrack including what went into what is perhaps the coolest piece of video game battle music ever made.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro, known for his work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/23/15387602/persona-5-soundtrack-music">producing the pop-y, jazzy vibes of the <em>Persona</em> soundtracks</a>, acknowledged that <em>Metaphor</em>’s heavy orchestral / choral sound is not something <em>Persona</em> fans would expect from him and definitely outside his own wheelhouse. He said in order to effectively change gears from <em>Persona</em> to <em>Metaphor</em>, he had to relearn classical music theory.</p><p>“But that’s what makes creating this score so exciting,” he said. “When I was first told about <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, I was told it would be an epic, high-fantasy RPG. And immediately I heard the sound of great orchestras playing and thought this might be an opportunity to write songs I’ve never really written before, which excited me greatly.”</p><p>In developing the music for <em>Metaphor</em>, Meguro said that he wanted to evoke a classical, fantasy experience but feature a unique twist that he said fans have come to expect from Atlus games. That twist became what Meguro called a “spiritual musical style” that defines the soundtrack, particularly the battle music.</p><p><small>As it was nominated for Game of the Year, <em>Metaphor</em>’s music made an appearance during this year’s Game Awards.</small></p><p>If you’ve spent any amount of time on gaming social media this year, you’ve probably seen tons of posts talking about <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music. For a battle theme it goes extremely <em>hard, </em>with one version starting off with an orchestra-backed choir singing with the kind of gusto you’d expect for a meeting with Sephiroth, not something that plays during every minor encounter in the game. Then, somehow, the song goes even harder with the addition of a Japanese monk chanting in a rapid-fire cadence that could go toe-to-toe with Eminem. To further elevate the songs, the chants were written in an original language inspired by Esperanto, a language that was invented in 1887 and designed to be used as an internationally universal secondary language.&nbsp;</p><p>But finding the right voice for the job wasn’t easy. “I was looking for a specific type of voice that could sustain a fast rhythm while reading Esperanto-inspired scripture,” Meguro said.&nbsp;</p><p>His search led him to YouTube, where scrolling through performances was how he found a monk named Keisuke Honryo performing in Nam Jazz Experiment, a musical group that combines jazz with the recitation of traditional Buddhist sutras. “It was so great, I immediately made [Honryo] an offer and luckily he accepted and was happy to be a part of this game.”</p><div><figcaption>Your fairy sidekick in Metaphor is also your DJ throughout the game.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>But there’s a reason why <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music is so arresting and it’s not just because of the musical stylings of a Japanese monk chanting in an invented language inspired by another invented language. Meguro had to reframe his thinking in developing the soundtrack, leading to the creation of something truly unique that changes how players perceive the game.</p><p>“I’ve always considered game scores to be similar to UI elements, constructs that exist solely to service the player,” Meguro said. “Although the score has to capture the atmosphere of the story for the user, it’s worth reminding ourselves that this music is not actually playing directly within the world the characters are in.”</p><p>Meguro explained that in conversations with the game’s director Katsura Hashino, the two discussed ways to connect what players are hearing to what the characters are hearing as well.</p><p>He said the thought experiment allowed them to “approach the music composition through a different lens.” The idea wound up implemented in the game itself. In <em>Metaphor’</em>s opening hours, the player’s sidekick casts a spell that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/465517/metaphor-refantazio-music-gallica-spell-in-your-head">allows them to hear music</a> as they roam about the world and, inevitably, get into fights.</p><p>That moment dramatically changes the context of all of <em>Metaphor’</em>s music, especially its battle themes. Taking those songs from fun bits of ambience for solely players and turning them into something the characters experience too, explains why the songs go hard as they do. Every fight for us is one more event on the way to the credits, for the characters it’s <em>life or death</em> and it makes sense that the music they hear as they fight for their lives, reflects that gravity.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro used <em>Metaphor</em>’s music to bring the players further into the game and he’s delighted by how well his work has been received. The two battle songs, called “<a href="https://youtu.be/v9foF43GJkk?si=jHsnbSSVCH2L8pt0">Warriors in Arms</a>” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/SjIJfwaFSAE?si=-64NgypXU_jMa_ZP">Warriors in Valor</a>” instantly resonated with players, <a href="https://x.com/TheBlackViking3/status/1842293436268916867">inspiring memes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/kkGi_1ogQsQ?si=pYxaDS3qinSun-DW">even animated shorts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“That brings me so much joy that fans are responding enthusiastically to the music of <em>Metaphor</em>,” Meguro said. “It’s an honor to get that kind of reaction.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But, at the other end of the spectrum, it had its fair share of stinkers too. Of course, reviews are and always have been objective critiques and whatever you might think of a game is your own opinion. You might have even played and enjoyed some of the games on this list – we all have guilty pleasures, right? But honestly, there were some really bad games released in 2024 that we definitely recommend you avoid…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Five - Mediocre</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/until-dawn-1717108744207.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking at IGN’s official review scale, fives are considered ‘Mediocre’ games – the “kind of bland, unremarkable games we’ve mostly forgotten about a day after we finish playing.” They’re far from the worst games on the list and aren’t even necessarily “bad” (that’s 4s and lower), but you’re going to have to work hard to get any real fun out of them..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the most populous score on this list, you’ll find a variety of different games. There are games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review">Slitterhead</a>, an absurd action-horror game from a team of ex-Silent Hill veterans where humans must fend off parasitic monsters. Sounds fun but unfortunately it’s just dull. Similarly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-dark-fate-defiance-review">Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance </a>takes the war against Skynet (great!) and turns it into a mediocre RTS (not so great).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a string of bland strategy games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/millennia-review">Millennia</a>, which our reviewer called “Civilization at home” after the McDonald’s at home meme; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review">Sins of a Solar Empire 2</a>, which is a lacklustre sequel to the 2008 4x game in space; and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/homeworld-vast-reaches-vr-review"> Homeworld: Vast Reaches.</a> Not to be confused with Homeworld 3, Vast Reaches is instead a strategy game built for VR, but feels more like a tech demo than a full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were also several disappointments that received a 5. Games many of us were eagerly looking forward to only to be let down by the final product. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review">The First Descendant</a> is a gorgeous-looking live-service shooter that unfortunately is more looks than substance, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-2024-review">Until Dawn remake</a> barely justified its existence over the excellent choose-your-own-adventure horror game original. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Supermassive Games didn’t have better luck on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, a Dead by Daylight spinoff based around one of the killers from the popular online horror game. The sub-six-hour horror adventure is hardly scary and adds nothing to the lore of Dead by Daylight according to our reviewer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The viral hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bodycam-early-access-review">Bodycam </a>– which captivated audiences thanks to a trailer featuring super-realistic graphics that looked like footage from a police bodycam – was also more sizzle than steak as the actual game was nothing close to what we saw in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most noteworthy is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which was also one of the first 5s IGN handed out this year. We waited almost a decade for a new game from Batman Arkham developers Rocksteady, and sadly the wait was not worth it. Many were already bummed to hear Rocksteady was not developing a new Batman game but rather a Suicide Squad game, but that could have had potential given how fun and zany those characters are. It could have been Rocksteady’s chance to spread its wings and move away from the grimdark Arkham-verse and go for a more colorful route. But ultimately what we got was kind of a letdown, let’s be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forgoing the single-player goodness of the Batman games, Rocksteady ventured into the world of live-service with a squad-based looter-shooter in which players and friends team up as members of the Suicide Squad like Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark. Unfortunately there just wasn’t enough of anything to makeSuicide Squad satisfying. The beloved combat from the Arkham games was completely absent, swapping crunchy melee for running-flying-shooting gameplay that felt okay, nothing more. Even looter-shooter fans would find the missions in Suicide Squad repetitive and bland. A forgettable experience from the decorated developers at Rocksteady.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big miss was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The newest entry into the Mario &amp; Luigi series developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch “misunderstands what made the Mario &amp; Luigi series great,” according to IGN’s reviewer. The first original Mario RPG to be released this year alongside remakes of Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Brothership has none of their charm and plenty of drawbacks such as the “ridiculously chatty dialogue, overbearing hand-holding, and boring, runtime padding fetch quests.” Bummer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the rest of the 5s is Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, whose original spearheaded the concept of online MMO racing games, but this sequel completely ignores any single-player content in favor of an annoying online-only strategy. There’s also a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-game-review">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Patrick Star Game,</a> which tries to revive the classic mascot platformer to middling effect, while Unknown 9: Awakening was a "routine action adventure game that probably wouldn’t blow me away even if it was well executed,” according to our review. And let’s not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct-review">Kong: Survivor Instinct</a>, a weird Metroidvania-style game in which you play as a human trying to survive in a city that Kong is destroying</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One game that was a personal disappointment was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-review">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</a>, a new game based on the animated film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Given the quality of past TMNT games and the quality of the animated film this is based on, the resulting game was unfortunately far short of either.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Four - Bad</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With the 5s out of the way, let’s make our way to the genuinely bad games. Literally, our review scale qualifies games that receive a 4 as “bad.” There are only three that received this distinction this year so let’s spend our time going through each of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/broken-roads-review">Broken Roads</a> was the first game in 2024 to receive a 4. This turn-based RPG set in post-apocalyptic Australia tried to deliver a more serious RPG experience complete with an ambitious morality system where players decide who lives and who dies. Rather than choosing one of the usual moral alignments like lawful good or neutral evil, Broken Roads gives players a full questionnaire that determines your beliefs in highly specific ways. But the problem is, outside of the questionnaire the system hardly matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per our review, “There are very few conversations involving a moral choice in the first place, and you’re locked out of pretty much all other conversations once you’ve started down a given alignment path, leaving no opportunities to try something drastically different later.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As interesting as a highly specific morality system is, what good is it if the game doesn’t put it to any use? Even worse, the more you play the faster you realize that Broken Roads is mostly filled with a bunch of fetch quests interrupted by exhausting dialogue. No thanks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another game that received a 4 is<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/endless-ocean-luminous-review"> Endless Ocean Luminous, </a>a remake of the original Endless Ocean first released on the Nintendo Wii. It’s a scuba diving adventure game in which each mission involves diving into a procedurally generated area of the ocean, to catalogue its various sea creatures and landmarks. Unfortunately, all of this becomes repetitive and, frankly, boring real fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The procedurally generated maps begin to look strikingly similar to each other almost immediately, and without a huge variety of missions or objectives, you’re effectively going from one part of the ocean to the next, cataloguing creatures until you hit your goal and move on to the next map. Then you repeat for hours. Our reviewer played about 26 hours of the game and were still not close to beating it – maybe that’s why it’s called Endless Ocean – and the kicker is that it was dull for most of that time..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final game to receive a 4 was one you no doubt saw trailers for. I’m talking about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review">Funko Fusion</a>, an adventure game where you travel through some of pop culture’s biggest movies and TV shows, the twist being you’re playing as the Funko Pops from those various worlds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Funko Fusion is best compared to  the LEGO games, which are simple but enjoyable 3D platformers based on popular bricks. But Funkos don’t have the same charm as LEGO and Funko Fusion is nowhere near as good as even some of the worst LEGO games. The story is all but meaningless, the mission design is repetitive, and you can’t overlook the game-breaking bugs that will stop your progress in its place.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Three - Awful</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that IGN did not award any 2s or 1s this year. Actually, we haven’t given a game a 1 since 2009, but that’s neither here nor there. The bad news is there are three games we gave a 3 to, which in our scale means they’re “Awful.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomic-heart-trapped-in-limbo-review">Atomic Heart’s Trapped in Limbo </a>DLC. It’s the second of Atomic Heart’s two DLCs and takes place after the events of the main game, and is plagued by two godawful gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first requires players to slide for really long stretches of time, avoiding obstacles and jumping when required. Our reviewer described this particular segment “like playing Tony Hawk with a broken ollie button, and the half-pipe is mined.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the DLC introduced first-person platform segments but unfortunately Atomic Heart just wasn’t designed for precise, first-person jumping, making them a painful slog right up until the end, which doesn’t take long to get to considering how short this DLC is. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you remember there was a new South Park game this year? Me neither, but it’s probably for the best. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-snow-day-review">South Park: Snow Day </a>is the third South Park game in a series that comprises Obsidian’s excellent South Park: The Stick of Truth, and the equally good South Park: The Fractured but Whole, both of which were fun RPGs based on the popular cartoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snow Day ditches the RPG genre and is instead a 3D hack-and-slash, which wouldn’t be so much of an issue if it weren’t for how awkward and clumsy the controls are. Worse still, Snow Day also ditches the one thing the animated series is loved for: the humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per our review, South Park: Snow Day features “appallingly flat writing [that] makes an already bad game not even worth pushing through for a few laughs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our final 3 of the year was handed out to<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review"> Empire of the Ants’ single-player campaign</a>. A real-time strategy game where players control a colony of ants, this 12-hour adventure is unfortunately a far cry from its potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the trailer showcased hyper-realistic ants moving in real-time, it’s obvious a lot more time was spent on how it looks rather than how it feels to play. With a difficulty curve that goes from easy to impossible in the blink of an eye, the campaign is an exercise in pain tolerance as one moment you’re mind-numbingly bored fighting easy enemies, before suddenly finding yourself defending your nest against a seemingly impossible wave of enemy ants. And without the ability to save mid-mission, failure means you’re starting from the beginning. No thanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it –those are the worst reviewed games of the year according. Be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024-look-back">Best Reviewed Games list here</a> as a palette cleanser, and let us know if you played any of the games on this list and how you feel about them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.
