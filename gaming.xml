<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amplitude-announce-endless-legend-2-an-oceanic-4x-with-manor-lords-outfit-hooded-horse-as-publisher">decidedly oceanic</a>, with seas that shift and retreat to reveal new areas over the course of a campaign, so it makes sense that at least one of the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game's new factions should be aquatic-themed. Say hello to the Aspects, and say hello to their coral. You'll be able to say hello to their coral because it is, in fact, a hivemind - a biomechanical reef that provides access to a gestalt intelligence called the Chorus, and which extends across their territory much like the Creep of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>'s Zerg, but in a less obviously menacing way.

<p>
"In terms of gameplay, the Aspects are an economic and diplomatic empire focused on cooperation over conquest," explains a press release from developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a> and publishers Hooded Horse. "Their main unique trait is their coral terrain - instead of claiming territories via outposts, the Aspects first place Coral Spores that will slowly spread coral to other tiles. These can be turned into cities, but they also serve as nodes for coral growth across the map." 
</p>
<p>
Yes. Yes. This is very much my cup of picturesque-but-insidious. Coral spores also extract dust, the game's magic resource, from their surroundings, while healing and accelerating your units and letting them cross water tiles. Best of all, they infest the minds of your rivals, making them better-disposed towards you. One way this happens is that other empires can exploit any coral growing on their territory for dust, which in turn lets the Aspect player see what they're seeing, and makes it easier to sway those empires in diplomacy.
</p>
<p>
Amplitude have written a big <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/965">forum post</a> explaining their inspirations for the faction's visual design (coral aside, their architecture calls on influences from central Asia) and playstyle. "For them, we wanted to move away from the classical trope of diplomatic pacifist faction and make them something more like 'deal with the devil'," the designers write. "They don't want this world to be safer but manipulate people for their own good.
</p>
<p>
"At first, we wanted to make them evil landlords, capturing territories then selling them to other empires," the post continues. "This idea evolved into the Coral growing toward other empires' assets and giving to the Aspect the possibility to sign some specific treaties and get additional resources.
</p>
<p>
"The main difficulty dealing with the development of this faction was the fact that the Coral is a common resource shared by all Aspect empires in the game. This creates drastic changes in how you will play this faction whether there is another Aspect empire in your game or not." Intriguing.
</p>
<p>
As for the Aspect at war, they're big on cooperation with a varied roster of "swarming scouts", "steadfast archers" and "powerful flying behemoths". One key overarching mechanic is that when an Aspect unit defends for a turn, it confers attack boosts on allies. So they are great counterpunchers, in short. If only real-life coral reefs were this resilient.
</p>
<p>
I really like this crafty and unpleasant approach to the idea of a diplomacy faction. It's certainly channelling the spirit of the first game's faction design, which (for example) cast dragons against type by sort of turning them into the UN.
</p>
<p>
But where is my faction of no-nonsense warmongering builder-bastards, I hear you cry? That would probably be <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-legend-2/blogs/964-kin-of-sheredyn-spotlight">the Kin of Sheredyn</a>, a band of cyberpunk Romans who are the remnants of a fallen interstellar empire. They're great at shield walls, hench automatons, and staying under their city cap because they think it's uncouth to expand too much. I haven't dug into the detail yet, but they feel like Endless Legend 2's equivalent for the first game's Vaulters.
</p>
<p>There will be two other factions ready to go for Endless Legend 2's early access launch this year, with two more planned for the 1.0 version. Any hopes for the remaining empires? I always liked the first game's Wandering Tribes, who found their cities on massive beetles. Perhaps the new game will harbour an equivalent who live inside whales.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Have you ever woken up and thought to yourself "I'd like to be a bear, or perhaps a moose, just for like, a little bit"? Oddly specific thing to think about first thing in the morning, but <strong>Striden</strong> has you covered at least. It's a looter shooter, yes, it's a survival game, sure, it's a team-based game, why not! Except sometimes, for some reason, you can just turn into different animals to fight your opponents, like a radioactive bear, which I think is very silly, but in a wonderful kind of way. And, as developer 5 Fortress announced today, it's getting an open beta this weekend so you can see what it's like for yourself.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a couple of new modes being introduced with the beta, the first being transmit mode. This one is PvP, and sees you duking it out with other players across "three intense maps in a fast-paced objective mode." Presumably this one involves moving something around, given the name. There's also a PvE mode which sees you trying to hold out against "relentless waves of enemies." More bears? No idea! I hope not, I don't like the idea of gunning down a bear.

<p>
5 Fortress also shared some of the more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2052970/view/536595840131663106?l=english">specific changes coming with the open beta</a> last month, like how the construction system has had a rework, namely introducing the ability to destroy enemy constructions, and the need to repair your construction tool to fix breached doors and windows. Sounds like it could be a bit overwhelming, but the game isn't even in early access yet, there's time to change things.
</p>
<p>
Each class now has three unique construction items they can build too, and a vault/ mantle system is in the works, but that one might not be in the open beta. The open beta itself starts tomorrow, April 4th, at 4:00 PM CEST, and finishes on April 6th at 12:00 AM CEST, and there'll be another test the weekend after from April 11th to 13th. Can't wait to see what other mostly regular animals that you can turn into get added in future updates.

<p>In the Call of Duty League, rostermania has been kicked into final gear in the <strong>day before </strong>the Major III qualifying stage. Moments ago, Vegas Falcons revealed that Arcitys and Priestahh will join Pred and Exnid to complete the four-man roster. </p>



<p>We’ll likely never know the size of the bag these players have been offered to represent the Vegas Falcons. Presently, the team has the worst record in COD esports history, having failed to win a single series since the season kicked off in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>The Vegas Falcons have had a woeful run, failing to win a single match since entering the Call of Duty League last year. They’re flat bottom in the standings, and unless something remarkable happens, the team is already out of this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is taking place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On social media, the Falcons team revealed the recent signing of Arcitys and Priestahh. The latter was recently dropped from LAG M8, which has also been on a monumentally miserable run of late, while the former comes up from a solid run in Challengers.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Two more World Champions have arrived to complete our roster. We’re ready to make some noise as we head into Major III Qualifiers.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Arcitys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Arcitys</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> 🦅💚 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Both of these players are former world champions, Priestahh much more recently than Arcitys. He was a part of the incredible New York Subliners roster that went on a dramatic run through the CDL 2023 season, winning Champs in record time with a 5-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>Arctiys has been out of the League since being dropped by Surge just over a year ago, but he has been in phenomenal shape in the Challengers circuit. Just days ago, he won the Dallas Open while flying the OMiT flag, and in July last year, he won the COD Challengers Final with Lore.</p>



<p>Do you think the Vegas Falcons can finally win a series? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Season 2: Hellfire Gala Official Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In Marvel Rivals Season 2, which begins April 11, the mutant Emma Frost is hosting the gala on the mutant island nation of Krakoa as a way of creating a temporary truce between the constantly fighting heroes and villains of the game's alternate Marvel universe.

                <p><a href="///">South of Midnight</a> <span>is Xbox's latest first-party game and the first release by Compulsion Games since the studio was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.</span> The southern gothic action-adventure game has its roots in a style of gameplay that's reminiscent of the OG Xbox era, and pairs that with a modern story that hits pretty hard at times. If you're wondering how long South of Midnight takes to beat, we have your answer below, including a full list of all South of Midnight chapters so you can follow along with your own progress.</p><h2>How long is South of Midnight?</h2><p>South of Midnight is a linear action-adventure game full of platforming, third-person combat, and some light puzzle-solving elements. As such, it's not meant to take up your time for weeks on end. It's here for a good time, not a long time, so says our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/south-of-midnight-review-a-love-letter-to-the-american-deep-south/1900-6418352/" data-ref-id="1900-6418352">South of Midnight review</a>.</p><p>A typical playthrough on<strong> normal difficulty will take you roughly 12-16 hours</strong>, depending on how well handle on the game's combat mechanics. Combat in the game is performed in closed-off sections of levels, so once you're in it, there's no easy way to escape it other than prevailing over the game's foes called Stigma. However, if you're defeated, <span>you<em> </em>can </span>load a save outside of the combat arena to catch your breath and maybe track down some more skill points before you try again.</p><p>This estimate changes with difficulty, naturally. If you're playing on an easier difficulty, you could likely speed through the game in about <strong>10-12 hours</strong>, while a hard-mode playthrough is going to take something like <strong>15-20 hours</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4470104"></a><figcaption>Hazel's journey brings her face to face with some peculiar folks in and around the bayou.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4470104-xbox_pj25_midnight_esrb_2160p59_h264_011825.00_22_56_03.still006.jpg"></figure><h2>South of Midnight chapters list</h2><p>There are 14 chapters in in South of Midnight, and these can be replayed during or after your playthrough.

			<p>Since December, or more accurately, since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, there’s been a feeling that Xbox has turned a corner for the better. Following up MachineGames' excellent Indiana Jones adventure was Obsidian, with a more than solid outing in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>. Which, in a few days from the time of publishing, will be followed up by Compulsion Games’ latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">South of Midnight</a>, which hopes to keep that momentum going.</p>
<p>South of Midnight is the third game in the studio’s history since its founding in 2009 and the first full game the team has made primarily under the Xbox banner after it was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. After the studio’s last batch of DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-happy-fews-last-dlc-we-all-fall-down-is-out-on-november-19th/">We Happy Few</a>, the six years since have been spent crafting Hazel and her mother Lacey’s story, complete with stop-motion animation. The Southern gothic tale begins with a hurricane far worse than anyone in her small fictional town of Prospero could have predicted and a fight between Hazel and Lacey.</p>
<p>After storming out of the house, Hazel looks on in horror as she watches the hurricane take her home, with her Mom in it, down the river. While chasing after the floating house to try and save her Mom, Hazel is chosen to become a new Weaver. A Weaver is a person who is able to see the strings and strands that make up what the game calls the Grand Tapestry. Basically, it is the fabric of life and the world, and it’s now Hazel’s job to help untangle the knots caused by the tragedy and pain we experience in life, either by choices of our own making or at the hands of evil people.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>The story in South of Midnight is a bit of an odd thing. Hazel’s journey toward understanding her Mom better and how their story plays out is kind of the least interesting part. At the same time, the game’s story is one of its strengths, and that all comes from the people you meet along Hazel’s journey to finding her Mom. South of Midnight’s story constantly surprised me because, from the outside, you wouldn’t guess that this game is nearly as dark or serious as it is. In each chapter, you’ll be charged with helping someone put the pain of their worst memories to rest by untangling the knot the bad parts of their lives caused.</p>
<p>And in each chapter, I was taken aback with just how intense and tragic all of these memories were. It was actually what helped to keep the story grounded, especially in the moments where Hazel is wall-running on a floating wall that looks like it’s been ripped off the side of a building.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-2.png"></a></figure>

<p>That’s not to say the relationship between Hazel and her Mom was boring or entirely uninteresting, just that it was out-shined by every other story told, whether in a short scene of a memory you witness or an old journal entry you find along the path. It also didn’t help that, more often than not, Hazel’s first words just after witnessing the memory of an extremely tragic event rarely fit the moment, with too many of her lines sounding like generic barks you might hear in any video game where the protagonist is constantly commenting on the world around them.</p>
<p>But there are a few moments of real, excellent storytelling with strong performances from the entire voice cast, including the voice behind Hazel, Adriyan Rae. This only made it all the more upsetting when Hazel would have a line that felt like she wasn’t paying attention to the events she just witnessed. Still, even with those disappointing moments, South of Midnight delivers an emotional story that packs a heavier punch than its bright visuals and stop-motion animation might have you expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of its visuals, the art design and the look of South of Midnight is arguably the best part of this game. I don’t mean that as a slight towards other aspects, or that it’s not worth playing. It often feels like if the best thing you have to say about a game is that it looks nice, then it probably has little to offer beyond that. Not the case with South of Midnight, as it definitely brings more to the table, but the design of this game and the detail poured into every corner is absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stop-motion animation effect did not agree with my eyes, and I did have to turn it off after playing the opening few chapters with it. I think your mileage with that effect may vary since my issues with it could also be traced to the number of stuttering bugs I witnessed during my playthrough. I was playing an early build of the game on my Xbox Series X that did not include the day-one patch, so I can only hope that the issues I have will be sorted by the time everyone else can jump in for themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of jumping, good as the story and performances are, the main gameplay of South of Midnight is what’s unfortunately lacking. The platforming isn’t bad. But it also isn’t great, and even though it evolves somewhat throughout the 14 chapters of the game’s story, particularly with the sections that have you running from a dark fog, it only starts to get interesting by the time you’re on the last couple of chapters. And by that point, these sections had been so repetitive that I was more peeved than excited to go through another one. Even if the design of these sections was starting to get good, which shouldn’t be the case in chapter 12 of a 14-chapter game.</p>
<p>The combat is, unfortunately, the worst part of the gameplay. Put simply, it’s boring and repetitive, and it wouldn’t detract from the game so much if you weren’t thrust into a combat arena every five minutes. The small skill tree you work through never adds to the combat in interesting ways; the best part about upgrading your skills is that it can help you move through these sections faster. A key issue is that there’s no flow to combat. Hazel doesn’t have a parry or a block mechanic, so all you can do is dash and dodge away from incoming attacks, which means you’re constantly pulling yourself out of the action in order to stay alive. And whether you’re locked on to a single enemy or not, the camera is awful at keeping pace with the combat, so you’re almost surely going to take a few hits that you just couldn’t prepare for because you didn’t see them coming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-4.png"></a></figure>

<p>Even when an enemy is in front of you, some attacks are more telegraphed than others, and you can only knock an enemy out of an animation by performing a ground-pound attack. It also doesn’t help that when you do take a hit, the knock-back effect makes Hazel so slow to react that you’re likely to take another hit before you can dodge to safety. That’s also where all the ‘challenge’ in the combat lies, not dying from hits you can’t see coming. Which makes any deaths you suffer frustrating for the wrong reasons. Even when you are performing well and not dying, the feedback on your attacks doesn’t feel satisfying, as you repeat the same set of animations again and again. And while the look of each enemy is interesting, what each of them adds to combat doesn’t evolve it in interesting ways or make you change your approach. This then feeds into the other issue that you don’t really get many different ways to approach combat. You’re mashing attack and dodge ad-nauseam, and when it’s over, you get a tragic, emotional scene about something awful that happened in a character’s life. The actions couldn’t feel more disconnected if they tried, which adds to combat feeling like a slog.</p>
<p>South of Midnight would be a tighter, more interesting game if the combat sections were instead replaced with gameplay akin to that of an adventure game or puzzle game, where you’re piecing together the past events to properly untangle what has become knotted. The gameplay there would also more easily weave into the game’s narrative instead of feeling like it’s trying to be an entirely different kind of game the moment combat starts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If there are any combat sections I could call out as good, it would be the few boss fights scattered throughout the game. But those sections aren’t good because the combat suddenly becomes fun, they’re good because of the scale of the bosses you’re fighting, and how well executed the presentation of each set piece is. So even though getting through to the end of a chapter isn’t all that fun with how many combat sections you have to get through, at least the set piece at the end was always visually stunning and a fun spectacle.</p>
<p>That’s also why I’d say the best of these chapter-ending set-pieces is actually one that members of the press, including Wccftech’s own Kai Tatsumoto, got to experience in <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/">previews</a>. How the music tied in with the story you had just witnessed, and the complete understanding you have about this giant tree that you’re climbing, still sticks out in my mind, days after seeing the credits roll. It was really beautiful, and I wish more of the game was able to weave gameplay and narrative as strongly as it was done there.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/South-of-Midnight-Review-7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lastly, speaking of the music, that is the final aspect of the storytelling that really makes South of Midnight special. The original songs written for each of the key characters from Prospero that you meet and help out are all so well done. It’s something you really have to experience for yourself, and it’s a big part of why I’d still recommend that you play South of Midnight. On top of the other visual and storytelling aspects I’ve already talked about, the music wraps it all together so beautifully.</p>

<p>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</p>

                <p>One of the big reveals from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a> this week was the announcement of a camera for the console's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">GameChat feature that's accessible by pressing the C button</a>. Nintendo has now further discussed GameChat in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-part interview series</a>, in which the company called GameChat a "defining" feature of the console and outlined the steps being taken to ensure safety when using the camera, especially for children.</p><p>Switch 2 design director Sumikazu Ono said Nintendo thought "a lot" about how to ensure GameChat is "safe and secure." Players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p>"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Ono said. "With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4470369" data-ratio="0.53227315247895" data-width="1069" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4470369"></a><figcaption>The Switch 2 camera.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4470369-screenshot2025-04-03at11.35.36am.png"></figure><p>If you join a room created by a friend, players will only see people you or your friend have approved from GameChat. Before joining a room, players will see if a friend of a friend is in the room--if they don't want to join for any reason, they don't have to.</p><p>With regard to protecting the safety of children, Ono said Nintendo had a "lot of internal discussion" on this topic--it was decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list if their parent or guardian has given permission via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app.</p><p>"In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on," Ono said.</p><p>Nintendo takes an "even more cautious" approach for video chats.</p><p>"When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent's app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritize safety and require parents to approve the request every time," Ono said.</p><h2><strong>Is The Switch 2 Camera Spying On You?</strong></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a "privacy shutter" that closes when not in use--as such, players should be able to see at a glance if the camera is on or off.</p><p>"We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/code-of-conduct/">Community Guidelines</a>, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><p>In 2024, the Edward Snowden leaks revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/british-spy-agency-considered-using-xbox-360-kinect-for-surveillance/1100-6418021/" data-ref-id="1100-6418021">a British spy agency considering using Xbox 360's Kinect camera to spy on people.</a> Whether or not any actual snooping took place, however, is unknown.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 camera from Nintendo sells for $50</a>, but the console also supports a variety of USB-C cameras from other manufacturers.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">GameSpot's hands-on preview of the Switch 2</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">preview of Mario Kart World.</a> GameSpot will have lots more on the Switch 2 in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

<p>The addition to Game Pass of course comes ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which is expected to launch later this year.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick recently told Bloomberg the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">exact release date of GTA 6 is remaining a secret for now</a> to "maintain the anticipation and excitement".</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, the latest game from the developer of <em>Cruelty Squad, </em>a man in the lobby of my building is having a mental breakdown because he's trying to get his pass and he wants to visit Australia. Eventually he will snap, shooting and killing me several times before I solve the problem by shooting him in the head. Outside of the office, a farmer has become radicalized because the government won’t respect his right to dump poison in the ground. He is also shooting me, while doing a Swedish Chef version of the Howard Beale speech from <em>Network</em>. This problem is solved when I step on him with a mech.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The consumer is a fascist.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, currently in early access,<em> </em>is the followup to the abrasive, brilliant shooter <em>Cruelty Squad </em>by Consumer Softproducts (aka developer Ville Kallio)<em>, </em>a shooter that launched many insufferable YouTube essays and countless very good speedruns. While <em>Cruelty Squad</em> was primarily a shooter, <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>bills itself as a “mecha FPS hybrid policing and punishment simulator.” You play a liberal kissass in a paramilitary wing of a nightmarish dystopian version of the EU, the Federation of Pan-Europa in the dystopian retrofuture of 2000 AD.</p><figure><figcaption>This is what dogs look like in this game because they're actually just people that have been turned into dogs.</figcaption></figure><p>The Psycho Patrol are the not-so-velvet fist of liberalism, a task force founded by your beautiful, brilliant boss Lorenzo Visconti, whose prime directive is to find and violently suppress misinformation, dubbed “psychohazards.” Initially you are tasked with finding out the source of misinformation about sodium lauryl sulfate, a common ingredient in shampoo.</p><figure><figcaption>V-Stalker my beloved...</figcaption></figure><p>The Psycho Patrol is built on the principles of (real) Austrian doctor and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, author of <em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em>. Anyone who has read Reich knows that he is onto something when it comes to the irrational nature of fascism being tied to sexual dysfunction – it is hard to question this when much of the Right is often formed from racist, homophobic and transphobic closet cases sublimating that impotence into hatred. He was also a beautiful, once-in-a-generation crank who believed in the power of a sexualized life force known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orgone Energy</a>, which he believed could be collected and harnessed, often in a big metal-lined box. This detail dovetails nicely into the lore and gameplay of <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>, as your character levels up their stats via Reichian self-criticism from the workplace psychologist. Your V-Stalker and certain energy weapons are powered by Orgone, and you can summon a friendly helper ghost dubbed a “bion,” which manifests as the EU logo with a big goofy cartoon smiley face.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's your smiling friend Bion!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R</em> is a game that expects more intellectually of the player than <em>Cruelty Squad </em>did. Like <em>Beyond Citadel</em>, the game wears its influences on its sleeve, and a <a href="https://datasparrow.itch.io/orientation-an-introductory-zinelet-to-psycho-patrol-r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful zine with an extensive reading list</a> of its inspirations has been provided, such as Masamune Shirow's lesser celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(manga)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dominion </em></a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patlabor:_The_TV_Series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Patlabor The Mobile Police: On Television</em></a>.&nbsp; While both games are brutal, <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> falls much more in the immersive sim category, often playing out like a funhouse version of <em>Deus Ex</em> but with additional mech combat. When I posted about the game on social media, a response I got from multiple people was that they didn’t understand what the game actually <em>was</em>, because the latitude of what you can do and how you can solve problems is pretty broad.</p><figure><figcaption>These are just real solid pulls outside of the context of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>One of your first quests is to try to remember your computer password. This can be done multiple ways: hacking your computer to reverse engineer the password, bribing the tyrannical IT guy until he tells you your password, or by a third, simpler way that takes a single keystroke. This is a game that requires that you read what’s on the screen and expects you to do critical and sometimes obtuse thinking. It often demands that you use older PC gaming muscles that may have atrophied.</p><figure><figcaption>The Psycho Patrol creed. Credit: Consumer Softproducts.</figcaption></figure><p>You will die frequently and violently in <em>Psycho Patrol R</em>. Sometimes this is your own damn fault for sneaking somewhere you shouldn’t, although often it’s because a random stranger just wants to shoot you in the head. Dying is part of the job, although when you die you drop whatever money you have on your person. Initially these sudden deaths feel unfair, as is the case of the Bridge of the Sovereign, a merciless early game skillcheck. The bridge is just outside of town and features several V-Stalkers that will kill your starter machine instantly. If you take the mechs head-on you will likely be demolished. You can easily solve this by either finding better guns and armor in an adjacent combat zone, buying upgrades or by getting out of your mech, taking the gun off of it, and shooting the V-Stalkers while on foot.</p><figure><figcaption>The purpose of this bridge is to humiliate you until you learn.</figcaption></figure><p>Constantly dying punches a hole in your wallet, and a primary way around this is to frequently invest whatever excess money you have in the stock market, itself a holdover from <em>Cruelty Squad</em>. This generates passive income, which you will need, because you must pay for your ammunition out of pocket. If you constantly shoot everything that moves with a chaingun you can quickly drive yourself deep into debt. Utilizing force is often less an ethical concern so much as it is a cost/benefit analysis. See, running the government like a business can be fun!</p><figure><figcaption>A banker expounds on ways to improve the quality of cheap vodka. I was broke enough when I was younger to research this.</figcaption></figure><p>If it was not already evident, <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>is one of the funniest games I’ve played in years. The world is a goofy nightmare and every interaction is filled with dry, deeply funny dialogue. When asked about his hobbies, a steroid-bound gym rat named Bramby Maximum will respond “I use the steroud [sic].” A grotesque failson of an independently wealthy man will gush to you about how many anime figurines he will buy when his father finally dies. A random NPC will entertain you with his theory of the value of people's lives being not only unequal but quantifiable, and that a CEO’s dog’s life could be theoretically worth more than that of a person’s. There’s a version of Twitter where you can see people slowly disintegrate and DM them abuse. Animals like dogs and horses have become exceedingly rare or extinct, so every animal in the game is just a person who has been grotesquely shaped into an animal (in a fashion similar to <a href="https://aftermath.site/kazuo-umezu-translation-of-fourteen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuo Umezo’s <em>Fourteen</em></a>). Characters names on their own are shockingly funny, like “Jordan Grindmax, ” “Brad Gortex,” “Thierry Subaru Deontology,” “Sonboy Megapractical,” and “Fecal Sovereign,” the last one being a direct reference to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtuse easter egg in the now-obsolete Nintendo emulator Nesticle</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Steurod.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Psycho Patrol R </em>has a long road to completion. Some exits to unbuilt zones in the game are clearly marked off while others are not. A few times I walked down a hall and fell off the map, but thankfully cyanide capsules have been patched into the game in case you get stuck. Despite its early access status, I am impressed by how much is already present, and I managed to clock about 27 hours in the game as is before wrapping the current main story mission. The world initially feels gargantuanly empty, but then you’ll hit a manhole cover or a secret door and find a complex, sprawling hidden world. The grotesque PlayStation 1 style of the game heightens this sparsity but deeply rewards exploring every inch. <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> feels like a nod to Osamu Sato’s <em>LSD: Dream Emulator, </em>not just in its nightmarish dreamscape sprites and clanging, willfully atonal soundtrack but also in the capriciousness of the world’s construction. <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>is the diary of the nightmares of Europe.</p><figure><figcaption>Your coworker is a nasty little freak online.</figcaption></figure><p>Though the reaction to the game has been overwhelmingly positive, I have seen complaints online about its difficulty, which I understand theoretically but disagree with. All games in early access need balancing, but <em>Psycho Patrol R </em>feels like a logical endpoint. If Ville Kallio had made a softer, easier game following <em>Cruelty Squad </em>I would have been deeply disappointed. And while the game can feel initially disorienting by design, there’s a fairly decent quick start guide in the menu that tells you most of what you need to know. Much of this feels less like a developer making something hard out of sadism and more like the growing pains of a game being difficult in a manner foreign to an existing fanbase. The game is also immensely breakable, and once you get the lay of the land, you can get to the current “end” of it in about four minutes, if that’s how you want to play. I’ve been enjoying watching players on YouTube develop new methods for turning <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> inside out, although I would recommend that you initially try it without help.</p><figure><figcaption>This guy lives in a turd hole. </figcaption></figure><p>I cannot know what <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> will become and what it is attempting to say just yet; it is an incomplete work and I’m not even sure the developer can fully anticipate where it will end. But the world it constructs feels both apropos and dryly funny in the most Finland-coded way possible. It has the potential to be one of those rare games that approaches literature. To play <em>Psycho Patrol</em> is to feel that rot-gut sensation about the world generally and Europe specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>Pan-Europa is full of mentally ill stochastic violence mediated by overt counter violence from the state, where humans are animalized into dogs and some men seek liberation in the sewers. The internet is poison and the only path to stability is your investment portfolio and a capricious market. There is no liberation or hope, no answer to the swelling tide of fascism save militant managerial liberalism. There is only your boss, who you worship like a god, and the promise of a modest promotion down the line after doing your job objectively poorly and being ripped apart by gunfire, flesh rats, and shrapnel roughly 87 times.</p><figure><figcaption>Well that's good I guess.</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As excited as we all were to see the new features and specs for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and, of course, the games that Nintendo has in store for it, the price of the console was always going to be the biggest talking point coming out of Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Which it certainly has been, due to just how high the price ended up being. $449.99 USD (or $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>) was not what gamers around the world wanted to read. Unless you happen to live in Japan, however, since Nintendo also revealed it will be selling a cheaper, Japan-only Switch 2 that's region-locked.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">VGC</a>, the 'Japanese-Language System' version of the Switch 2 will be available at <strong>49,980 yen</strong>, which works out closer to&nbsp;<strong>$334 USD.&nbsp;</strong>The version of the Switch 2 that supports multiple languages, which is the one everyone outside of Japan will be buying, will cost <strong>69,980 yen</strong>.</p>
<p>If you plan on going to Japan sometime after June 5, 2025, and have no trouble reading and understanding Japanese, then it's not entirely clear if you could purchase one of these consoles at the cheaper, Japan-only price, and take it back to your home country and continue to enjoy it there.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">reports</a> that the console will only be "<em>linkable to [Nintendo] accounts with their country/region set to Japan,</em>" so, presumably, as long as you meet that requirement (and again, can read and understand Japanese), you could get the Switch 2 for more than $100 less than you would have otherwise paid. Though surely the trip to Japan, or shipping the Japanese-only Switch 2 out of the country to wherever you live, will fill that gap quickly enough.</p>
<p>As to why Nintendo is adopting this two-tiered pricing model for Japan only, Ahmad has a few common-sense theories.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">To discourage reselling of the new system by foreign buyers who leverage the console’s lower price point in the country to resell the title to regions with a higher price – an issue faced by the first Nintendo</span></em> Switch," Ahmad writes.</p>
<p>He also adds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">regarding the tariffs</a> announced by the United States and Donald Trump on Wednesday, that the difference in pricing between Japan and the United States particularly, is "<em>likely a calculated move on Nintendo’s part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen and local market conditions</em>."</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">Japan accounted for nearly 25% of global Nintendo Switch unit sales, with Nintendo offering a cheaper Switch 2 SKU in this market to stimulate early adoption and maintain</span></em> <em>momentum</em>," he continues.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-contrast="auto">While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the Switch 2 showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect.</span></em>"</p>
<p>At least Ahmad does end on a more positive note, saying that he does not believe Nintendo will raise the price of the console within the first five years of its lifetime.</p>

			<p>The full Monster Hunter Wilds 1.010.00.00 patch notes have been revealed, confirming the new content and changes coming to the latest entry in the series ahead of the patch's release in a few hours.</p>
<p>Besides highlighting the return of series' classic monster Mizustune, its Tempered variant, and the Zoh Shia high rank hunt, <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.010.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the patch notes</a> revealed some previously unknown balance changes, which include the increase in guild points rewards for investigations, the increase of points required for Wyverian Melding and Meld Decorations functions at the Melding Pot, and Mantles rebalancing, including the previously announced nerfing of the Corrupted Mantle.</p>
<p>Among the changes to weapons, most have been left untouched, except for the Lance, which receives a change that makes it easier to land thrust attack finishers after a focus strike, and the Bow, which sees nerfs to Dragon Piercer and buffs to Power Volley and Thousand Dragons, among other things. Sadly, the patch notes don't reveal any unexpected performance improvements, other than the VRAM usage improvements and upgraded DirectStorage version confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-pc-improvements/">last week.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 will begin next week, and the developer has also confirmed two new playable characters for the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Emma Frost and Ultron will be joining the ranks of the Marvel-themed hero shooter when its second season begins on April 11th. It's not yet clear what role either character will play in terms of mechanics.</p>

<p>The debut trailer welcomes players to the Hellfire Gala, which is hosted on the mutant-led island of Krakoa. However, during the opening ceremony of the gala, Ultron interferes and essentially declares war on the gathered heroes. Exciting stuff!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=srW0X84m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=iwbT0xYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ultron joins the cast of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in season 2, along with Emma Frost.</figcaption></figure><p>We also seemingly see a new range of skins that will be available for many of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' existing characters, with heroes like Wolverine, Cloak and Dagger, and Captain America decked out in their finest formal wear.</p>

<p>NetEase hasn't yet revealed what else lies in wait for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players when season 2 arrives, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">season 1</a> is anything to go by, you can expect new events, a new battle pass, and perhaps even some more playable characters arriving later in the season.</p>

<p>Several heroes coming to the game have already <a href="https://www.si.com/esports/news/x-men-heroes-leak-for-marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly been leaked</a>, including the likes of Cyclops, Gambit, and Rogue, as well as a number of other X-Men-related characters (and, of course, Deadpool).</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that we're simply assuming Emma Frost and Ultron will be playable; it's possible only one of them will be, or maybe even neither of them, unlikely as that may be. Nevertheless, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's an<em>&nbsp;Overwatch</em>-style hero shooter that lets you play as some of your favorite Marvel heroes (and villains!) across a series of objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">40 million players</a> within its first few months on release, but despite that success, NetEase still elected to shut down the Seattle studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' creation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/640287/heart-machine-patreon-gdc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Heart Machine, the studio behind games like <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>, <em>Solar Ash</em>, and the upcoming platformer <em>Possessor(s)</em>, launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/HeartMachineHQ/home">Patreon</a> last December. Like many other developers, it has dealt with its share of struggles, including layoffs <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">late last year</a>. With the many challenges in the gaming industry right now, the studio is experimenting with using Patreon as a source of revenue and to help build community.</p><p>“The Patreon’s there, really, to open up to the community and talk about certain things when it comes to game development,” Heart Machine founder Alx Preston told <em>The Verge</em> at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last month. “I think there’s still a lot of distance between developers traditionally and the audience that consumes what they make — what we make — so finding ways to dig back in and have a conversation there is important.”</p><p>It could help on the money front, too. “Industry dynamics have changed a lot, so money is tough to come by in a lot of ways,” Preston said. “Whatever we can do to support ourselves and stay alive longer term is an important thing to turn to, as well.”</p><p>The indie games space has run into a fair share of challenges lately, including Annapurna Interactive’s team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">resigning</a> and Take-Two selling its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289932/take-two-private-division-publisher-sale">Private Division indie label</a> last year. While there have been some bright spots — including that the former Annapurna team has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">taken over</a> Private Division’s discarded games — indie games still face some difficulties getting funding and succeeding in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Even former lifelines like Netflix have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">pulled back on indie investing</a>.</p><p>While it’s not a replacement for proper funding — <em>Possessor(s) </em>is being published by Devolver Digital — the subscription is meant to be a potential way to augment the studio’s earnings. Patreon isn’t “our biggest portion of revenue or anything,” Preston said. (Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/heartmachinehq/about">About page</a> on Patreon shows it has around 230 paid members out of about 700 total members.)</p><p>But the idea is to grow it over time. “If you keep engaging and keep doing more stuff there, it’s a different model than going to publishers for money all the time,” he said, adding that it’s “the experimental phase of figuring out what the fuck works these days.”</p><p>Heart Machine isn’t the only developer to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/creators/gaming">utilize Patreon</a> – <em>Caves of Qud</em> developer <a href="https://www.patreon.com/freeholdgames">Freehold Games</a> is another notable example — but it’s one of the most prominent that’s experimenting with the platform. “Since the old models are not enough, we have to adapt,” Preston said in Heart Machine’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTx8TGLPeKc">announcement about the Patreon</a>. “So we’re asking for support to help us continue to not just survive, but adapt and thrive.”</p><p>“We’ve always been big on talking directly to our audience,” he said. “We think this Patreon is an opportunity for us to do more on this front while also benefiting.”</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is set to launch this year.

We’ll get into that in a bit; let’s first take a look at the easier side of respeccing in <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>.</p><h2 id="h54780"><a id="skills"></a>How to respec your skills</h2><p><strong>You can respec your skill points for free at any time by accessing the Skill Tree</strong>. You can opt to unlearn a single skill by selecting that skill and pressing the corresponding button on the bottom of the screen, or you can reset all of your skills by holding down the corresponding button (also found at the bottom of the screen). On PlayStation, this is Triangle and L3, respectively, but it’ll differ depending on your platform.</p><h2 id="h54781"><a id="stats"></a>How to respec your stats</h2><figure id="" data-id="02b066f9546fe3352d6da79c64dc2eed" data-recommend-id="image://02b066f9546fe3352d6da79c64dc2eed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a merchant selling Primevil Regression Orbs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of a merchant selling Primevil Regression Orbs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02b066f9546fe3352d6da79c64dc2eed" data-recommend-id="image://02b066f9546fe3352d6da79c64dc2eed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of a merchant selling Primevil Regression Orbs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> also allows you to respec your stats by refunding all of your earned Lacrima (experience points). There are no notable downsides to doing this. But <strong>unlike resetting your skills, stat respecs will require a little something extra</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/khazan-first-berserker-easy-mode-difficulty-soulslike-1851773051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/khazan-first-berserker-easy-mode-difficulty-soulslike-1851773051"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>’s Easy Mode Is An Excellent Lifeline</a></span></p><p><strong>To reset your stats, you’ll need to use a consumable known as a Primevil Regression Orb</strong>. If you’re still early in your adventure, you’ll find these to be very scarce. You can purchase three of them from a bard you encounter during the third main mission for a hefty chunk of cash, but you’ll want to use them sparingly early on. You can craft them at the blacksmith later in the game, though, so you won’t have to be careful forever.</p><hr><p><br><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history.

Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Neptunia-Trilogy-PS4_04-03-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989.

Sounds easy enough – except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ‘80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends!

He insists that evolution should be a good thing, and this probably won't be the last time, either.</p><p>"Let's remember, 20 years from now he'll probably receive another 'nip and tuck' here and there to keep him fresh and current," he continued. "Look at early Mickey Mouse compared to modern Mickey Mouse. Evolution, while being sympathetic to the original, is an art--but it has to be done gradually, and this latest incarnation is perfect in my opinion.

From the bit of the demo we played of Bananza, Donkey Kong has never looked better in video game form, and the game may just be his 3D platformer redemption.</p>

            <p>Just over an hour ago at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-treehouse-live-presentations-announced-featuring-hands-on-gameplay-of-switch-2-titles">Nintendo kicked off the first of its two Treehouse: Live presentations</a> focusing on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>While the games are the main focal point of today's presentation - we've already had a deeper look into console launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-mario-kart-worlds-grand-prix-and-free-roam-modes-work">gave us a better understanding of how its Grand Prix and Free Roam modes work</a> - there is one comment that is dominating the live chat: "Drop the price."</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshots below, the price of both the console itself and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> is a clear bone of contention among viewers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Nintendo Switch 2 is due to be released on 5th June</a>, retailing £395.99. A bundle including Mario Kart World will also be available, retailing at £429.99. In isolation, Mario Kart World will retail for £74.99 for a physical copy, or £66.99 digitally.</p>
<p>Since the reveal, there has been online uproar at the console's pricing. However, as Ed laid out earlier, if we take into consideration inflation over the last eight years, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle works out cheaper in the UK than the original Switch with a copy of Breath of the Wild</a> did back in 2017.</p>

			<p>The physical release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> won't require an additional download to run, as the entire game will be included in the cart.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, CD Projekt Red's Vice President of Business Jan Rosner confirmed the game will ship on a 64 GB cart that includes both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion, so no additional download will be required to run the game. The game will launch the same day the Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide for the price of $69.99, €69.99.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on June 5th. SRP is $69.99/€69.99. The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>— Jan Rosner (@jan_rosner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jan_rosner/status/1907780644131799153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the time, we haven't seen much of Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition running on Nintendo Switch 2 besides the short trailer shown during yesterday's Nintendo Direct, but it seems like a high refresh rate experience is out of the cards, even in docked mode. Earlier today, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier confirmed, after a hands-on session, that the game runs at 40 FPS in Performance Mode with the console docked, which is definitely disappointing for those who expected a 60 FPS mode, but not completely unexpected, considering how demanding the game can be.</p>

<p lang="en">Some other Switch 2 observations:<br>
- The "Welcome Tour" app is surprisingly cool (one minigame reminded me of Mario Paint) and it is insane that Nintendo is charging for it<br>
- Metroid looks and feels fantastic<br>
- Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 40fps in performance mode while docked (oof)</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>
