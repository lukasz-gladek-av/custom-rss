            <p>Our <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> review hails the game as "a generous Soulsy adventure hybrid that works within its limitations and delivers a beautiful challenge to be unpicked with a magical toolbox". Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.</p>
<p>All that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other "content creators" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of "trigger words" like "Covid-19", no talk of "politics" or "feminist propaganda", and no mention of "China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc". </p><!--more-->
<p>The Google Doc in question is apparently from a representative of Chinese publisher Hero Games, one of developer Game Science's largest external investors, who have also partnered through investment with Kuro Games Studio, creators of Wuthering Waves. It was shared on Bluesky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/exserv.bsky.social">French journalist Benoit Reinier</a> over the weekend and subsequently written up by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda">VideoGames SI</a>. IGN have also now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid">verified it</a>, citing an anonymous source. I've asked Game Science for a comment on the matter, but I haven't had anything back. </p>
<p>The email outlines various "Do's and Don'ts" for people streaming or making other types of content about Black Myth: Wukong. Under "Do's", we find only "enjoy the game!" Under "Don'ts", we find the below:</p>
<blockquote> <p>• Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use any offensive language/humor.</p>
<p> • Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</p>
<p> • Do NOT use trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'COVID-19'.</p>
<p>• Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cautionary note against "feminist propaganda" is a reminder that Game Science have yet to respond to allegations of pervasive sexist behaviour from November last year. In a lengthy report for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a>, Rebekah Valentine and Khee Hoon Chan described "a studio plagued by claims of sexism", linking this to misogyny elsewhere in the Chinese games industry and on the government-firewalled Chinese internet. The developers have raised the drawbridge in response: when Edders attended a preview event earlier this year, they refused to say anything on the subject in advance. </p>
<p>The request not to focus on Covid, meanwhile, seems to reflect the Chinese government's track record for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnkednnp400o">censoring discussion of the disease and preventative measures</a>.</p>
<p>I know little about the internal workings of Chinese game publishing or the Chinese gaming community, but yesterday Lu-Hai Liang published an interesting editorial for <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Black-Myth-Wukong-release-could-redefine-China-s-gaming-industry">Nikkei</a> in which he explores Black Myth: Wukong's importance to the regional games industry and to Chinese players. It's a prestigious, "triple-A" release from a country that, in Liang's analysis, lacks a track record for "premium" single player offerings due to government regulation of consoles, and is associated overseas with free-to-play gacha mechanics like those found in Genshin Impact - to say nothing of sinophobic reactions to the international investments of Chinese publishers like Tencent. </p>
<p>In Liang's view, Wukong's evident quality and global popularity have made it attractive to Chinese nationalists, and this has at times mushroomed into jingoistic dog-piling of the game's critics - especially in the wake of IGN's report into sexism at Game Science. "There is an edge to the online response and the attachment Chinese players feel for Black Myth: Wukong can tip into nationalistic pride," Liang writes. </p>
<p>I'll let you know if I hear anything back from the developers. In the meantime, Hero Games have just announced CrisisX, the tale of a devastating infestation in a quiet US coastal town. It'll be on show at Gamescom this week - I wonder if they'll ask booth attendees to avoid mentioning quarantines in their coverage.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/HERO-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-CRISISX">a press release about CrisisX</a>, Hero Games's CEO Daniel Wu also describes the company's ambition to expand their publishing operations into western markets. "We are deeply invested in the global markets, and with CrisisX, we aim to take Hero Games to the next level," he wrote. "We feel that now is the time to introduce ourselves and our products to a wider audience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has given us our best look yet at its upcoming animated series, Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft.</p>
<p>The show is scheduled to make its debut on the streaming service this autumn, and features the vocal talents of the MCU's Hayley Atwell as Lara Croft. It's all set to take place after the events of the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, which comprised Tomb Raider (2013), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<p>"Following the events of the Survivor Trilogy, Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures," reads the official blurb. "But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artefact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection."</p>
<p>As you would expect from a Tomb Raider anything, the upcoming show will see Lara travelling to many exotic locales, and - of course - heading into some strange and forgotten tombs. Here, Lara will be "forced to confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become", the show teases.</p>
<p>Along with Atwell, Earl Baylon is reprising his role as Jonah from the Survivor trilogy of games. And, while I can't say 100 percent right now, I do believe that's Lara meeting up with Alex's computer wiz sister Kaz in the trailer (which you can see above). Kaz is the first confirmed gay character within the Tomb Raider series, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">introduced in the Tomb Raider comics by Rhianna Pratchett</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/playback-enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In 2010, Enslaved Odyssey to the West made its entrance onto the gaming scene. It wasn’t the most challenging game out there, nor did it bring with it a defining gameplay mechanic, but Enslaved had something that made it stand out: the heart showcased by its characters and engaging story. Just like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, it takes inspiration from Chinese tale Journey to the West, and it’s a story that explores the themes of fear, loss, cooperation, and the changing nature of relationships, which is made all the better as central characters Monkey, Trip, and Pigsy interact with each other so well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved - PS3 / X360 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmfAORuigW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Revisiting Enslaved Odyssey to the West 14 years after its release, and the last time I played it, made me consider whether I’d been seeing the game through rose-tinted glasses. If we really want to be reductive, Enslaved Odyssey to the West is an escort mission spread out over eight hours. At the start of the game, Monkey and Trip, who do not know each other, escape from a slaver’s airship, crashing down into the ruins of our civilisation. The name of Enslaved comes from the very literal enslaving of Monkey by Trip. While Monkey is out cold, Trip crowns him with a slaver headpiece, which allows her to give him commands. It also links the two, so if Trip dies, Monkey dies. Trip is out in the real wider world for the first time, and in her first interaction with Monkey, she saw a musclebound man chasing and shouting at her.</p>


<p>Trip doesn’t enslave Monkey to use him as a tool, but to guarantee her own safety as she finds herself in the company of a man who could quite easily cause her serious harm. She doesn’t know his intentions, and this is the only way she feels that she can be safe. Of course, Monkey is unhappy with the situation but soon accepts his fate and works with Trip to get her home. The story doesn’t follow a typical master and slave theme though. In most situations, Monkey is in charge and takes control, often having to order Trip around to move to places or carry out tasks. There are times Trip makes requests, but they are given as general instructions and not orders.</p>
<p>Despite, the name and the situation, both Monkey and Trip learn that the only way they can survive the world is through cooperation and partnership. The fall of our civilisation is not outright explained, as it happened a couple of hundred years ago, and neither of the two main characters are sure. What we can surmise from all of the mechs running around is that these robots were used in war and either turned on humans or were programmed to turn on them, which led to the majority of humanity being killed while some survivors created smaller enclaves or roamed alone, trying to survive in a world where danger lurked.</p>


<p>It is these dangers that the two navigate, Monkey through combat and Trip through her technical knowledge. She is the one Monkey relies on to operate controls and cause distractions, as well as upgrade his gear, while she relies on Monkey to keep her safe from the mechs that attack. They both later come to rely on Pigsy, who enjoyably looks like a pig and acts like a pig as well, to help them. Pigsy has his own goals but is happy to lend his services, though not without almost getting Monkey killed on purpose and hitting on Trip, who at this point has just found her father dead. Pigsy is portrayed as unlikeable, but at the end of the game he makes a big sacrifice for the others. In his standalone DLC, again Pigsy comes across as an idiot and braggart, but enjoys some character growth as he learns that he had what he needed by his side all that time.</p>
<p>Returning to the combat, and it is very basic compared to the games that have followed in the last 14 years. Enemies attack in small groups, with Monkey wielding a staff that can stun and destroy enemies through melee attacks, or firing plasma. There are a few enemy types and most are easy to take down, and the majority of the boss fights, while entertaining and set in interesting arenas, are quite repetitive as well. Even navigation is straightforward, with climbing points literally glowing and really not possible to miss at all taking away any challenge of finding your way. The camera is janky too at times, moving so focus on enemies is lost, letting them disappear off screen and attack from range. Yet, none of this takes away from the game’s charm. The world and the characters are in some way relatable, each going through their own development and growth. Monkey from a gruff loner to someone who stands up and fights for those by his side, Trip from a scared, lost, and unsure person to having more confidence in her abilities to be able to survive the world.</p>

<p>The final showdown at Pyramid also poses an ethical question: what is the nature of real life? We find that those who have been captured have not been enslaved but placed in a simulation to live lives from the old world, instead of having to survive in the harsh reality of its ruins. Monkey glimpses this world and calls it beautiful, but Trip destroys it all before asking if what she has done is right? We will never know as there is no sequel coming, but a big part of it would have been the fallout from Pyramid’s destruction. You suddenly have hundreds of people yanked from a reality where they had families and friends, and shoved back into the harsh fallen world. This could lead to mass mental trauma and PTSD as people grieve those they have lost, and may no longer be capable of surviving. However, it can also be argued that these people were enslaved to an idea that no longer existed and needed to be pulled out so they could build a new world.</p>
<p>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is still worth a playthrough now, both for those who played it way back, and for those who have never experienced it. You will come away from the game having enjoyed yourself and a bit let down that plans for a sequel were cancelled.</p>

            <p>Our unlucky planet in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wasteland-waste-disposal">Wasteland Waste Disposal</a> has suffered not just one apocalypse but all of them. Turns out the "megapocalypse" was an unhealthy combination of "every worst-case apocalyptic scenario imaginable". Luckily, in this upcoming sandbox adventure, you have a giant metal fortress that walks above the pools of toxic sludge on huge spidery legs and chomps up all the trash you bring it. If you are not intrigued by that, perhaps the little janitor with a sci-fi vacuum cleaner (or the feel-good music reminiscent of Adventure Time songs) will convince you. </p>

<p>It looks like your mobile metal fortress will be a big focus, as you upgrade it with new gear and pop bits of scaffolding on the exterior to make room for smelting pots and roof gardens. But acid rain and radioactive storms may weather the hull, according to developers Kluk Digital. The other major thing you'll be doing is lowering yourself to the earth's banjaxed surface on a big elevator and doing a lot of environmental cleanup. We see our hero driving in a little digger and a forklift, for example, steadily tidying up a small city neighbourhood. There will also be creatures to collect and farm, with helpful or harmful habits. "Not all organisms are created equally useful," say the game's creators.</p>
<p>Cleaning games have a power over me. The red muck of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/viscera-cleanup-detail">Viscera Cleanup Detail</a> is a gag stretched out like a yellow rubber glove, until it becomes a kind of compelling chore. Its down-to-earth equivalent, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, fills me with a healthy fear because I know if I start playing it I will never stop. But my favourite game about recycling is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, which sees you lasering metal and glass in zero gravity, surrounded by giant disposal machinery that will slurp you up just as quickly as it swallows old passenger seats. </p>
<p>All these games fill you with a compulsion to turn goo to gleam, or gnarl to neatness. And seeing the timelapse of the bouffant beautifier in Wasteland Waste Disposal as they scurry around hoovering up leaves, twigs and mud to turn an urban ruin into habitable space is very much activating my "tidy up" glands. The developers want to create a "small open world" partly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>, they say, which is a nice mash-up of influences. Many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/search?q=open+world+#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=open%20world%20&amp;gsc.page=1">open world games</a> can afford to be more compact. Looking at you, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>There's no release yet but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946140/Wasteland_Waste_disposal/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, if you're the detoxifying type.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> - Game Science's action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology - has had an impressive debut on Steam, surpassing record concurrent player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>. In just a few short hours, it has already become the most played single-player title of all time on Steam.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Black Myth: Wukong is currently the fourth most played game of all time on Valve's platform, with only Counter-Strike 2, Palworld and PUBG: Battlegrounds ahead of it in terms of peak concurrent players.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game has recorded a concurrent player peak of 1,443,570. By comparison, Cyberpunk 2077's all-time concurrent player peak is sitting at 1,054,388. Elden Ring's concurrent all-time peak, meanwhile, is 953,426. </p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong has not been without controversy, though. Prior to its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">posts from Game Science CEO Féng Jì</a> including sexualised and misogynistic language were reported. More recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> also reported further on the studio's history with sexism.</p>
<p>Then, just this weekend, images of a leaked document sent to influencers surfaced online, requesting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-studio-requests-influencers-not-include-feminist-propaganda-or-covid-19-references-in-coverage">do not include "politics", "feminist propaganda", or references to Covid-19</a> in their Black Myth: Wukong coverage.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Black Myth: Wukong three out of five stars.</p>

Razer was the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194977/razer-snap-tap-mode-huntsman-v3-pro-wooting-rappy-snappy">first keyboard maker to add</a> a Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD) feature to its range of Huntsman V3 Pro keyboards last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204422/wooting-razer-snap-tap-socd-beta-feature">followed shortly by Wooting</a>. Using Snap Tap as Razer calls it or Wooting’s Snappy Tappy will now get you kicked from <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> games.</p><p>“Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we’ve decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn’t acceptable in Counter-Strike,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F730%2Fview%2F6500469346429600836">says Valve</a>. “We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially—exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.”</p><div><figcaption><em>You’ll get kicked from a Counter-Strike 2 game if you use Razer or Wooting’s new SOCD keyboard features.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I’ve tested using SOCD in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> this morning and can confirm you get removed from a game on Valve’s official servers, but there’s no account ban. Valve is banning the use of these keyboard features, but it doesn’t appear to be ready to ban accounts for using them right now.</p><p>Razer and Wooting’s SOCD features both let players automate switching strafe directions without having to learn the skill. Normally, to switch strafe directions in a first-person shooter, you have to fully release one key before pressing the other. If both are pressed, they cancel each other, and you stand there for a moment until you release one of the keys. SOCD means you don’t need to release a key and you can&nbsp;rapidly tap the A or D key to counter-strafe with little to no effort.</p><p>Some professional <em>Counter-Strike 2 </em>players had called for SOCD to be banned, much like how null binds that prevent you from pressing two opposing directions have been banned in tournaments for years.</p><p>Wooting reluctantly added a beta version of SOCD to its range of keyboards after Razer introduced the feature on its own hardware. “We are glad Valve has taken a stance against Snap Tap,” says Wooting in a <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1825799396459515913">post on X</a> today. “Don’t use Snappy Tappy (SOCD) or Rappy Snappy in CS2 any more as it will result in a kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is out today and it’s already storming up the charts. On Steam, the game has skyrocketed to a peak concurrent player count of almost 1.5 million players, which is coming remarkably close to threatening the spot held by Counter-Strike 2 (formerly CSGO), with a record of 1.8 million concurrent users.</p>



<p>This Chinese blockbuster of a title has been widely regarded as one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2024 for quite some time. In recent days, we’ve seen plenty of leaked content that showcased just how impressive this Tencent-backed action RPG is, and now that it’s here, the numbers are backing up the hype.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wukong-rising">Wukong Rising</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong comes from Game Science, a studio headquartered in Shenzhen. Inspired by <em>Journey to the West</em>, Black Myth puts players in control of the ‘Destined One’, bound to a journey that’ll see them explore a vast world while fighting some of the most gargantuan, impressive bosses we’ve seen in recent years.</p>



<p>As a result of a solid pre-launch marketing campaign, Black Myth: Wukong’s status started gathering pace with reckless abandon in the last couple of weeks. It has been released to an overwhelmingly positive reception worldwide, and on Steam especially, the player count is soaring.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.42 million peak concurrent players</a> are neck-deep in Black Myth, exploring all that this stellar title has to offer.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean all is going swimmingly in the world of Game Science, though. Most recently, the studio was lambasted for issuing ‘influencer guidelines’ that warned users against the promotion of feminism or the discussion of almost anything related to China on stream.</p>



<p>Will Black Myth: Wukong top the all-time high held by Counter-Strike?</p>

But when the next round began, Cifuentes was in Robb's place, sparking confusion among observers and throwing the bracket into chaos.</p><p>As it turned out, Robb had been issued a loss over what The Pokémon Company International Global Esports and Events Director Chris Brown called an "unsporting conduct penalty" in a follow-up interview with IGN.</p><p>"It was an unsporting conduct penalty," Brown said. "We applied it to the match that had just occurred and the standard penalty for that's a match loss."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— ゆうD (@ikuo_x) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikuo_x/status/1825030789651890401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The unsporting conduct Brown was referring to was a motion that Robb performed after claiming victory that many took to be an offensive gesture.

There's other kind of moments, and this is really fine detail and sort of the rules and policies, but in the [Swiss-system tournament] for example, when the information is actually put in the computer could be a factor, because then we have to pair the next round.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A few years on from the two-case collection of Famicom Detective Club remakes, Nintendo is following up on the promise and potential of this visual novel series with the first fully new entry in 27 years. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-has-been-revealed/">Emio –&nbsp;The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</a> is coming out at the end of this month, putting our youthful sleuths through the wringer of another traumatic murder case.</p>
<p>From today and through to the game’s launch on 29th August, Nintendo is teasing out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/sample-a-multi-part-demo-for-emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-next-week/">the first few chapters of the game with a free demo</a>, and we’ve sampled the prologue and first chapter of the game a little ahead of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - Official Case Briefing #1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/quR1vN9OeeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s another day at Utsugi Decetive Agency, with our 19 year old protagonist (who you get to name) continuing on as an assistant detective at the agency. Barely have you said hello to Utsugi when the phone rings with the police calling you to a strange and unsettling crime scene.</p>
<p>A body has been found that morning, a teenager still in middle school… but they were found with a paper bag on their head, marked with a smiling face.</p>

<p>This quickly grows into the revelation that this could be tied to a decades old case that Utsugi was aware of and the urban legend of Emio – The Smiling Man, a person with a bag on their head who finds crying girls and tells them quite specifically that they’re going to give them a smile that lasts forever. But is this the same killer? A copycat? Something else entirely?</p>
<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/famicom-detective-club-review-the-missing-heir-the-girl-who-stands-behind/">the remade Famicom Detective Club duology</a>, or even the more jovial Ace Attorney series, you’ll immediately find your footing with the visual novel-style gameplay of this game.</p>

<p>The early conversations and interactions through the Prologue and Chapter 1 gradually set out the scope of what you’ll have to do. Most of the time you’ll select ‘Ask/Listen’ and potentially a sub-topic to engage in conversation with someone, but sometimes the conversation might dry up, nudging you to ‘Look/Examine’ the person or the environment to prise out new clues, or to ‘Think’ and have your internal dialogue nudge you down another path. Thankfully you are generally prompted by highlighted words when you need to think or if there’s something new to ask about, though you might end up still simply tapping through all the options to try and find the one with new info.</p>
<p>There’s further options, to call over to another person, dip into your journal with all the collated details on people, and more, though the opening chapter only touches on this lightly.</p>
<p>One thing that does return for the chapter conclusion is the case review, a sit down chat with Ayumi to go over the facts and latest discoveries and try to draw some conclusions. It’s basically a mini quiz to see if you’ve been paying even a modicum of attention, though you can also point out suspects that could be a bit of a punt.</p>

<p>Emio – The Smiling man seems to take a few incremental steps forward in terms of the game presentation. The art style is very much in keeping with the 2021 remakes, but I feel like there’s a shade more animation to characters in their idle states, their hair waving gently in a breeze, and the like. Animation to go along with dialogue is snappy and to the point, fading between motions to quickly relate a motion, but without dragging thing out. Helpful when the game’s voice work is Japanese only, so you &nbsp;can skip through dialogue as fast as you can read.</p>
<p>But while this is a more serious kind of mystery than an Ace Attorney, that doesn’t mean there isn’t space for some unusual and memorable characters. In particular detectives Kuze and Kamihara are polar opposites to one another, Kuze being very intense and by-the-book, while Kamihara is a rather unserious character in some ways, deliberately a bit mean, it seems.</p>
<p>This is really just the very beginning of the case, and I can read barely anything into how it’s going to progress at this point, but I’ve no doubt that there will be plenty of twists and turns, more murders, and a gradually emerging gallery of suspects.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 will be available within the demo later this week on 23rd August, before the third chapter is added on 28th August ahead of the full launch. I’m already keen to peel back more of the mystery in the coming days.</p>

Instead, the company turned to its history by giving us our first look at the completed Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, which is now scheduled to open on October 2, 2024.</p><p>The presentation was hosted by none other than Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, who walked through the main exhibits and activities museum attendees can expect at the new facility. Read on to learn everything announced at today’s Nintendo Museum Direct, including the existence of enormous Wii Remotes!</p><h3><strong>Miyamoto Introduces the Museum</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-0-35-screenshot-1724110179484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The presentation began with Miyamoto sharing the history of the museum site, revealing that the Nintendo museum is built on the same grounds as Nintendo’s original playing card factory, which was then used for quality checks during the Famicom (NES) era. The entrance to the museum greets visitors with a Mario-themed plaza, complete with warp pipes, a question block, and more Super Mario Bros. items.</p><h3><strong>You Can Play Nintendo Games With Enormous Controllers</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-11-36-screenshot-1724110179484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The highlight of the presentation was seeing the enormous recreations of Nintendo controllers visitors will be able to use to play a selection of classic Nintendo games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and Wii eras. While we got an extended demo of Miyamoto playing Super Mario Bros. alongside a museum staff member, the star of the show was undoubtedly watching two museum staff members working together to play Wii Sports Resort using a giant Wii Remote’s motion controls. Just look at it!!</p><h3><strong>Attractions that Pull from Nintendo’s Toymaking Days</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-6-48-screenshot-1724110179483.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Direct only showed off three of the eight interactive experiences, but the <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/exhibition/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Nintendo Museum website details</u></a> the rest. This is the full list of unique play experiences the Nintendo Museum will offer on the first floor:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Shigureden SP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Explore Hyakunin Isshu poems using smart devices and the giant screen on the floor.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Zapper &amp; Scope SP</strong> <ul data-cy="list"><li>Experience shooting using the Zapper and Super Scope in the world of Mario that spreads out on the giant screen in front of you.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ultra Machine SP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A batting-cage experience inside a room. Hit the balls pitched by the Ultra Machine.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ultra Hand SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Use the Ultra Hand to grab the balls rolling down the lanes, and drop them into the pipes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Love Tester SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Two people join hands and work together on tests that measure their Love Level.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Game &amp; Watch SP</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Play Game &amp; Watch games using your own shadow.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nintendo Classics</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64. Choose from over 80 games to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Big Controller </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Controllers from past hardware generations made giant. Two people must work together to take on challenges in games released back in the day.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Visitors Can’t See Every Attraction with a Single Ticket</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendomuseum-1724110179483.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One odd wrinkle about the Nintendo Museum is that visitors can’t experience all eight exhibits with a single ticket. As detailed on the official website, digital coins are required to experience the interactive exhibits, and each visitor is only granted 10 coins upon entry. <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/guide/service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>You can’t purchase additional coins</u></a> once you run out, so as of now it seems you’ll need multiple visits to the Nintendo Museum to get your hands on everything it has to offer. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment and clarification on this.</p><h3><strong>A Rotunda of Nintendo Products</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-2-16-screenshot-1724110179482.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The second floor has a gallery of products created and published by Nintendo from NES to now. This includes games and consoles in Nintendo’s catalog, complete with different iterations of hardware and game boxes to account for differences across Japan, North America, Europe, and other regions. Each section of the exhibit is marked with a big (but not quite as huge) replica of each Nintendo controller and handheld. </p><p>There are also exhibits for products played by moving your body, the evolution of the Question Block, the evolution of graphics in games like Mario and Zelda, and an exhibit of products Nintendo made before it entered the video game business, like a copy machine and even a baby stroller.</p><h3><strong>Make Your Own Hanafuda Cards</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/nintendo-museum-direct-12-1-screenshot-1724110179481.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Nintendo Museum harkens all the way back to the beginning of the company with an interactive experience where visitors can design their own Hanafuda cards. This hour-long experience does cost extra, but participants will get to take home the four cards they made. There is also a Play Room where visitors can learn to play one of the most popular versions of Hanafuda.</p><p>Along with a museum restaurant and shop Miyamoto teased at the very end of the presentation, that’s what Nintendo fans can expect if they make the long trek to the Nintendo museum in Kyoto. Tickets will cost 3,300 yen (~$23 USD) for adults, with cheaper price ranges for children. Right now, the museum is holding a lottery drawing for the chance to purchase tickets for dates beginning with the museum’s grand opening on October 2, which <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can enter here</a>.</p><p>What did you think of today’s Nintendo Museum Direct?
