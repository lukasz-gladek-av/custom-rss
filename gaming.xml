            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-unsupported<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer mode won't be playable on Steam Deck, Sony and porting studio Nixxes have announced, and the reason once again involves PSN.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/17/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-cross-play-and-system-requirements-revealed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">p</a><a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1790396884873355624" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ost on X</a> outlining the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements">impending PC release</a>, Nixxes says that&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player mode, including its&nbsp;<em>Iki Island&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be fully playable on Steam Deck thanks to extensive optimization efforts.</p>
<p>However, the game will technically sport an "Unsupported" rating on Steam Deck. That's the rating Valve assigns to games for which "some or all" of their functionality doesn't work on Steam Deck, and in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s case, it's the multiplayer component.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=02rP6qA2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=eXoBAy5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player is fully playable on Steam Deck, but its multiplayer is not.</figcaption></figure><p>Nixxes says that because&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer requires Windows "to access PlayStation Network integrated features", you won't be able to play the game on Steam Deck, which runs a custom Linux shell.</p>
<p>This represents another stumbling block for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>on PC when it comes to PSN integration. Last week, owing to its requirement for a PSN ID in order to access multiplayer, the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed from Steam in many countries in which PSN is not available</a>.</p>
<p>A PSN account isn't required to play the single-player game, though, which is why you'll be able to enjoy it on your Steam Deck without any restrictions.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sony has slipped up with regards to PSN account requirements.</p>
<p>Although Sony recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked back</a> a decision to require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">link a PSN ID with their Steam account</a> to keep playing on PC, that game was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">delisted in many non-PSN countries</a>, and at time of writing, it hasn't been restored.</p>
<h2><em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global PC launch timings revealed</h2>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>PC players, though. Along with the warning about Steam Deck compatibility, Nixxes also revealed the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global launch timings on PC.</p>
<p>Most areas of the world will get to play the game on May 16th, but if you're in Sydney, Auckland, or Tokyo, you'll have to wait until the following day due to time zone shenanigans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156397/tomb-raider-series-amazon-phoebe-waller-bridge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In addition to announcing a second season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156409/hihi-b"><em>Mr. And Mrs. Smith</em></a> and a fifth season of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24156299/the-boys-are-coming-back-for-a-fifth-season"><em>The Boys</em></a>, Amazon is adding another new series to its television lineup: <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-video-orders-itomb-raideri-series-based-on-t">a live-action <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. The series will be produced in collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge serving as the show’s writer and executive producer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574923/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-series-phoebe-waller-bridge">confirming rumors reported earlier last year</a>.</p><p>The <em>Tomb Raider</em> series is no stranger to live-action adaptations. In the 2000s, Angelina Jolie starred as the badass grave robber in<em> Lara Croft: Tomb Raider </em>and its sequel, <em>The Cradle of Life</em>. At the time, both movies were financial if not critical successes but are viewed more favorably today, especially when compared to contemporaries like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and <em>Max Payne</em>. In 2018, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/7/12122532/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-march-2018">a reboot of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> movie franchise</a> was produced to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695274/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review">the reboot of the game series</a>, this time with <em>Ex Machina</em> star Alicia Vikander in the lead.</p><p>With the <em>Fallout</em> show hitting over 65 million viewers, Amazon has proven it can make a pretty good video game adaptation. Plus, the streamer is no stranger to successful adaptations of other mediums with <em>The Boys</em>, <em>Gen V</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>,<em> </em>so a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series seems like it could be a good fit. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/27/21031773/phoebe-waller-bridge-2019-fleabag-killing-eve-james-bond-amazon-prime-video-emmys">notable for her work on <em>Fleabag</em> and <em>Killing Eve</em></a>, also seems to be a fan of the series, sharing in Amazon’s press release, “Lara Croft means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” I’m not sure if bats were a pain in the ass in the reboots as they were in the original trilogy, but at least, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24072931/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-game-review">as an original trilogy fan myself</a>, I feel like the series is in capable hands. She also has hands-on tomb-raiding experience, so to speak, starring alongside Harrison Ford in the latest <em>Indiana Jones </em>movie.</p><div><p>The streamer is producing this new show in tandem with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">Amazon Games publishing the next entry in the <em>Tomb Raider</em> game series</a>. This also means that if the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series turns out to be good, fans likely won’t have to wait too long for a new game like all the poor players <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034">jonesing for a new <em>Fallout</em> entry</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-megalopolis-trailer-might-be-the-coolest-thing-i%E2%80%99ve-ever-seen.870483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156434/megalopolis-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="N72y4i"><em>Megalopoli</em>s<em>, </em>legendary director Francis Ford Coppola’s first film in 14 years, is one of 2024’s most notable movies for two reasons. First, it is the decades-in-development self-funded passion project of a cinematic titan, and second, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/megalopolis-francis-ford-coppola-challenges-distribution-1235867556/">no one wants to distribute it</a>. On paper, that’s plenty baffling, but it only becomes more so when you see what the film looks like. </p>
<p id="38TxhT">An urban fantasy about an idealist who seeks to rebuild a New York City-like metropolis into a utopia following a disaster, the trailer is mostly a montage of dreams and decadence. Statues walk, chariots race in Madison Square Garden, and Adam Driver ruminates on the nature of utopias. </p>
<p id="HLLByi">At just a minute and a half, the trailer is awe-inspiring (even on a phone screen), with little context for the narrative. It’s the platonic ideal of movie marketing: Win, lose or draw, the trailer sells <em>Megalopolis</em> as something that <em>must</em> be seen, preferably in a theater. Let’s hope that after the film premieres at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, we get the chance to see it, and very soon at that. </p>

  <p id="Fwd752">After making fans wage war by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107923/house-dragon-game-thrones-trailer-red-black-team">picking which of two trailers to watch on YouTube</a><em>, </em>HBO is back with a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419614/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2</a> that promises things will go quite badly no matter who your fave is. That’s the Westeros Promise, baby!</p>
<p id="LSmqLU">While the first season skipped through time, season 2 looks like it’s settling in for the long haul. The new episodes seem to depict the immediate fallout from last season, when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney)</a> was installed as king in a coup over Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), kicking off the Targaryen Civil War, aka <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">the Dance of the Dragons</a>.</p>
<p id="6uVt9n">The new trailer shows off both sides of the Worst Family Ever amassing supporters and dragons, promising tons of sexy intrigue and backstabbing in addition to big, brutal battles atop horse and dragon. Frankly, it looks pretty spectacular, and even if the we know where this story ends, getting there seems like it’s gonna be a hell of a ride. </p>
<p id="og0jsW"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 premieres on HBO and Max on June 16.</p>

Come July, that and a few other titles, like <em>Puzzle Arcade</em>, will be gone, so if you’re a preservationist, or just someone a little bit nostalgic for the early days of digital-only console games, you may want to give it a look.</p><p>Other games, like the Xbox 360 versions of 2014’s <em>Thief, Trials Fusion, </em>and <em>Far Cry 4</em>, will also be unavailable digitally once the store closes, but these are also titles you can find in print, on other systems like PC, or on modern console storefronts thanks to backward compatibility between the last few generations.</p><p>Some of the games listed vary between regions, but for the most part, there are over 60 games that you rarely see on sale that are heavily discounted right now. If you’ve got an Xbox 360, or think you might want to hold onto some of these titles, I’d urge you to get on it right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-players-filed-27-million-reports-in-six-months-%E2%80%93-but-only-10-were-legit.870471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-players-reports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In the latest <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/45/df/45dff59c-7b36-44df-9e64-e673dae355c1.pdf?n=293843.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Transparency Report</a>, Microsoft revealed a whole host of information related to the moderation, user protection, and enforcement ecosystems it promotes across its gaming platforms. In a staggering figure, it was shown that more than 27.4 <strong>million </strong>reports were filed by Xbox players in the space of six months in H2 2023.</p>



<p>It was revealed that a whopping 12.7 million reports were filed regarding in-game or on-platform communications and that in the six months, more than 10.3 million enforcements were issued – but only 2.1 million of those came from player reports, which is fewer than 10% overall. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-issue">What’s The Issue?</h2>



<p>Either 25 million reports were filed in error (or maliciously) or Microsoft’s moderation system is a little more lenient than we’ve been led to believe.</p>



<p>If 27.4 million reports were filed but only 2.1 million reports ended up leading to enforcement, there’s a stark imbalance somewhere in the system. However, Microsoft was quick to confirm that proactive enforcement is much more prevalent, with the tech titan using automated systems to detect cheaters and malicious operators on its platforms. That’s primarily why H2 of 2023 saw a whopping 79% of all enforcement action come off the back of proactive measures.</p>



<p>Amazingly, it was revealed that Microsoft secured a proactive enforcement rate of 100% (or close enough to that figure) for account tampering, piracy, cheating, fraud, and phishing, slamming down on these topics long before they were reported by players. </p>



<p>Out of the millions of enforcements across the board, it was confirmed that around 693,000 were issued due to harassment or bullying, and another 551,000 were due to adult sexual content. At the other end of the spectrum, 7.32 million enforcements were issued due to cheating or inauthentic accounts. </p>



<p>In the closing slides, Microsoft claimed that it’s increasing more toxicity on its platforms over time, and that includes text-based, image-based, and video-based communications. That’s not always a good thing, though – an Xbox user recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-user-baldurs-gate-ban/">got a one-year ban</a> for sharing a captured game clip featuring a sex scene in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>

<h2>How To Get Poipole</h2><p>Unlike most other Ultra Beasts in Pokemon Go, Poipole is only obtainable through the World of Wonders Special Research story. Complete the first step of the questline and you'll earn a chance to catch Poipole. You have until June 1 to claim the World of Wonders Special Research.</p><p>If you've purchased a Wonder Ticket, you can also add a second Poipole to your collection by completing the third and final set of Timed Research tasks. Wonder Tickets are available through the in-game item shop until June 1 for $10 USD.</p><h2>How To Evolve Poipole Into Naganadel</h2><p>Poipole's evolved form, Naganadel, officially debuts in Pokemon Go on May 23, during the Ultra Space Wonders event. To obtain Naganadel, <strong>set Poipole as your buddy Pokemon and catch 20 dragon-type Pokemon</strong>. Once you've met that condition, you can evolve Poipole using <strong>200 Poipole Candy</strong>.</p><h2>Ultra Space Wonders Event</h2><p>As mentioned, Naganadel will debut as part of Pokemon Go's Ultra Space Wonders event, which runs until May 28. In addition to Naganadel, the Ultra Beasts Stakataka and Blacephalon are also debuting during the event. The former will appear in five-star raids in the Eastern Hemisphere, while the latter will only be available in the Western Hemisphere.</p><p>On top of that, players will earn double the usual amount of XP for winning Ultra Beast Raid Battles, and the final part of this season's Special Research story will go live, giving you a chance to earn additional rewards including more Poipole Candy. Shiny Mareanie will also be available for the first time. You'll have a chance of encountering one in the wild along with the following Pokemon:</p><ul><li>Ekans</li><li>Zubat</li><li>Tentacool</li><li>Koffing</li><li>Stunky</li><li>Croagunk</li><li>Trubbish</li><li>Skrelp</li><li>Dratini</li></ul><p>Pokemon Go has a few other events lined up before its Season of Wonders concludes on June 1.

Amazon Prime's foray into the iconic gaming property comes hot on the heels of its success with the Fallout series, and today's announcement only noted one talent signed to the project: Fleabag creator/writer/star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Waller-Bridge is listed as a writer and executive producer here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The series, based on the iconic Tomb Raider video game franchise, follows the adventures of world-famous archaeologist and adventurer Lara Croft," reads a press release. "The series is produced by Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, and will premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Tomb Raider on TV">Tomb Raider on TV</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There have been a number of Tomb Raider adaptations for film, starting with the early 2000s films starring Angelina Jolie and the more recent 2018 reboot headlined by Alicia Vikander. If Waller-Bridge brings any of the trademark humor (and brutal honesty) of her Fleabag series to Tomb Raider, this could be a very different (and refreshing) take on the adventure property indeed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news also shows that Embracer is keen to get in on the current transmedia sweep, particularly for prestige TV and film. Amazon's own Fallout show has been, by all counts, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-says-fallout-attracted-65-million-viewers-in-just-over-two-weeks">a sweeping success</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with a second season in the works. HBO's The Last of Us show, also a huge hit, started the prestige trend, and also has a new season coming (with the potential for more).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Fallout and The Last of Us are any indication, popular series also see huge bumps in player counts for their associated video game properties—and Embracer was quick to mention a new Tomb Raider game is also in production. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fallout-games-double-in-player-count-after-prime-video-show">numbers indicate that, increasingly, viewers become players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—and players will go back for second helpings of the games after watching the shows.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

<p data-characters="221" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Today, during the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> 8th Anniversary livestream, Behaviour Interactive handed the floor over to developer Midwinter Entertainment to discuss its upcoming shared world shooter set in the same horrific world. </p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Currently codenamed <em>Project T</em> and still very early in development, this third-person shooter takes players into the otherworldly <em>Dead by Daylight</em> fog and forces them to survive and thrive against the terrifying monsters that emerge from it. It’s a very different game for the franchise, but one Midwinter Entertainment wants to take the same approach with, developing it alongside the community based on their feedback and interactions. </p>
 <h2 id="h-project-t-playtest-pushes-playtest-sign-ups-live" data-injectable="false"><em>Project T</em> playtest pushes playtest sign ups live</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/truck-in-project-t.jpeg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Midwinter Entertainment offered a brief explanation of what <em>Project T</em> is, but you can see yourself in its upcoming playtests. All you need to do is sign up for the <a href="https://insiderprogram.bhvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Program</a>, and you’ll receive emails about upcoming events as and when they’re planned. Initially, the playtest is only for PC, but will expand to consoles in the future. </p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The <em>Dead by Daylight</em> spin-off is still in early development, but I’m mostly just itching to get in for for exclusive rewards being offered for playtesters. Gotta be lookin’ good and ready when<em> DbD</em> celebrates its eighth anniversary. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Not a survivor or a Killer, but a secret third thing</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">In <em>Project T</em>, players aren’t <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-survivor-perks-in-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivors</a> or Killers; they’re Trespassers. It’s a new role to the universe. They’re individuals who have also been whisked away from their reality by The Entity into its domain, where it hopes to extract even more fear from them. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Trespassers will find themselves in a realm called The Backwater, a sort of dark, overgrown swamp. They must work together and fight back against the monsters, known as The Thrall, that emerge from the fallen trees, sticky bogs, and feral overgrowth using whatever they have to hand. Thankfully, and perhaps surprisingly to <em>Dead by Daylight</em> fans, the main tools at a Trespasser’s disposal are guns. </p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">The goal of each match is for Trespassers to complete objectives as they move through The Backwater and kill any Thrall that tries to stop them. The Backwater changes over time, though, meaning every match you play will look and feel different. There are trucks to help traverse, and while driving between objectives is one use for these vehicles, Midwinter Entertainment hinted they might be useful for completing those objectives as well. </p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">During a press preview, Midwinter Entertainment was asked about character crossovers with <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. The studio did not confirm what crossovers would look like, but did mention there will be a lot of crossover between <em>Project T </em>and <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. All I’ve been able to imagine since is a battle-hardened version of Dwight Fairfield with a shotgun and using his tie as a bandana. </p>

<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you enjoy driving cars around the <em>Fortnite</em> map, you’ll likely be more than familiar with running out of gas and traveling on foot until you find another vehicle. Visiting a gas station is a quick and easy way to refuel your car, allowing you to keep driving until you find another to take its place.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-gas-station-in-fortnite" data-injectable="false">Where to find a Gas Station in <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Eight gas station spawns exist in <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5, Season 2, primarily around Reckless Railways and Rebel’s Roost. Other named landmarks like Snooty Steppes and Grand Glacier have stations nearby, giving you several locations to visit, depending on the Battle Bus’ travel direction. Below is a map of every gas station location.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Almost every gas station also has a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-sports-car-locations-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">car spawn</a> for you to grab if your current one is low health. That way, you can quickly refuel and head out or swap out your car for an improved version. Sometimes, you may have a weekly or event quest asking you to visit a gas station and refuel your vehicle, allowing you to knock out this objective and get some quick and easy XP.</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, if you&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to refuel your car, you can interact with a gas pump and bring the nozzle to your vehicle.&nbsp;As you hold your attack button toward the car with the gas nozzle, your fuel percentage will rise until it reaches 100&nbsp;percent. Just be careful, as, during this time, anyone can come in and damage you, your car, or the nearby pumps, creating dangerous explosions.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="7gql5B">It’s been a bit of a slow time of year for comedy movies, but 2024 has enough laugh-out loud gems to round out a list. And there’s a wide variety of sub-genres to pick from: musical reboots, existential animated kids’ movies, campy horror flicks, and even a DC parody.</p>
<p id="FQB0r3">So behold: the best comedy movies of 2024 so far. This list will continue to be updated throughout the year, and will be sorted in reverse chronological order, so the newest movies always show up first. </p>

<p id="1hMB6r">Director Pamela Adlon (<em>Better Things</em>) gets nitty and gritty about the epic highs and lows of pregnancy in <em>Babes</em>, but the best part is the central relationship between two best friends. Eden (Ilana Glazer), a single yoga teacher, and Dawn (Michelle Buteau), a married dentist with two kids, have been besties for decades — and even though their life priorities are a bit different now, they make time for each other. </p>
<p id="Gko4uU">Eden finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand, and decides to go through with having the baby. It’s a new stage of their relationship, especially as Dawn struggles with balancing her job, her family, and her friendship with Eden, all while Eden embarks on this scary journey of single motherhood. It’s wickedly funny, but also says a lot about the strain adulthood puts on friendships. — <em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="UNVz7u">Director-star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24119175/peoples-joker-director-interview-banned-batman-trans-movie">Vera Drew</a> initially planned <em>The People’s Joker </em><a href="https://www.thepeoplesjoker.com/get-involved">as a found footage movie</a>, pulling together clips from Joker’s past, present, and future to create a new Jokerfied experience. While the found footage element didn’t happen, the end result (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23353241/the-peoples-joker-review">after a brief delay over rights issues</a>) is a breath of fresh, satirical air in our IP-saturated landscape, part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">a new wave of trans-authored cinema</a> that is shaking up what mainstream audiences can experience in trans film.</p>
<p id="SnZ4XM"><em>The People’s Joker </em>cleverly uses the DC canon as grounding for the setting, an avenue to explore gender expression, and for comedy, subverting expectations of these well-known characters. But my favorite part of the movie is how Vera utilizes many different styles of animation from many different creators to create a mixed media effect. It’s unlike anything else you’ll see this year. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="M9KJPp">The true story of the <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n03/bee-wilson/merely-a-warning-that-a-noun-is-coming">Littlehampton poison pen letter scandal of 1923</a> is a fairly depressing one, another in a long line of reminders that justice systems depend on people’s judgment, and people are notoriously prone to prejudice, stereotypes, and other forms of confirmation bias that get in the way of the truth. But Thea Sharrock’s lively (and heavily fictionalized) British comedy about the scandal addresses those points with a light perspective that offers a little uplift and a lot of good humor. International treasure Olivia Colman (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18236661/the-favourite-story-ending"><em>The Favourite</em></a>) stars as Edith Swan, a pious working-class spinster who starts getting obscene anonymous letters; Jessie Buckley is her neighbor, Rose Gooding, a foul-mouthed libertine accused of writing them, in an era where calling someone a “foxy ass whore” in print was enough to warrant a prison sentence at hard labor.</p>
<p id="IalFAt">The absolute shock and disbelief Edith and Rose’s entire community feels over seeing words like “asshole” in print is part of the humor here, but a lot more of it comes from Jonny Sweet’s bouncy, winking script, which keeps the action zippy and highlights the ironies of an entire community full of hypocrites delighting in their self-righteous offense at the letters. (Any metaphor for today’s online communications is strictly intended.) Colman and Buckley’s performances add a terrific edge to it all, but this is an ensemble piece at heart, and Anjana Vasan as a lady detective trying to wade through institutional sexism rounds out the cast for a lively, sparky story that isn’t particularly believable as history, but sure lands well as funny, engaging metaphor. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="YPgfRS">Don’t get fooled by only seeing one Coen name in the credits; <em>Drive-Away Dolls</em> (or its original title, which still appears in the credits: <em>Drive-Away Dykes</em>) has the same hilarious crime-caper spirit that marks all of the Coen brothers’ best early works. </p>
<p id="3QmTsK">The ’90s-set movie follows two lesbian friends (Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan) on an East Coast road trip with two clueless gangsters hot on their trail. Equal parts excellent friends-on-the-road movie and crime comedy, <em>Drive-Away Dolls</em> is an early contender for the most fun movie of 2024, and one that will likely be hard to beat. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="0v8i8b">“What if Looney Tunes, but for adults, and filtered through video games and silent slapstick comedy?” That’s the genius combination that makes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127338/hundreds-of-beavers-movie-review-funny-new-comedy-silent"><em>Hundreds of Beavers</em></a><em> </em>one of the most special movies of the year, a pure expression of cinematic comedy that will have you laughing in stitches. The low-budget indie follows Jean Kayak (Ryland Brickson Cole Twes), a trapper trying to survive in the harsh winter of the Great Lakes region. He’s surrounded by hundreds of beavers (which are presented as people in mascot beaver costumes) who view him as a threat, and he must solve a series of problems and puzzles to survive and thrive in the harsh environment.</p>
<p id="9eYmMI">Ludicrously silly and packed to the brim with jaw-dropping gags and special effects on its limited budgets, <em>Hundreds of Beavers </em>is the funniest movie I’ve seen in years. It’s the perfect antidote for what has ailed mainstream American comedy for years, by actually bringing back jokes instead of just the tone of comedy. I can not recommend it highly enough. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="qOxu2E">Fans of the Broadway musical <em>Mean Girls</em>, based on the 2004 movie <em>Mean Girls</em>, have understandably bridled against some of the changes in this screen adaptation, from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036144/mean-girls-songs-cut-from-broadway-musical-differences">many songs cut from the Broadway version</a> to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24033633/mean-girls-musical-movie-review-2024-tina-fey">casting of protagonist Cady Heron</a>. But while it’s an imperfect translation of the stage experience, it still stands on its own as a lively, creatively staged movie that puts plenty of verve into its catchy, inviting musical numbers.</p>
<p id="e2cruF">The performances aren’t out to replace the 2004 version of the movie: They’re new interpretations, delivered with big musical energy. This is a tremendously fun movie, designed to send people home singing. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="ajGXRN">Jake Johnson’s directorial debut follows a man who’s so at sea after a breakup that he agrees to star in an underground reality competition where he tries to survive for a month with assassins trying to kill him. But <em>Self Reliance</em> isn’t the kind of manic thriller that premise suggests; Johnson told Polygon it’s much more of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036265/jake-johnson-self-reliance-interview-wes-anderson-connection">a mashup of two of his favorite movies</a>: Wes Anderson’s <em>Bottle Rocket</em> and the Adrian Lyne thriller <em>Jacob’s Ladder</em>. That’s an odd combination of improbably dissimilar projects, but they coalesce into an offbeat indie comedy about human connection, and the mortifying ordeal of trying to be known by people who aren’t all that interested in the knowing.</p>
<p id="W4zkl1">Produced by The Lonely Island and featuring Andy Samberg playing himself in a pretty hilarious cameo, <em>Self Reliance</em> has some of the same dry humor and secret sentiment as the group’s movie <em>Palm Springs</em>, but with even smaller stakes and even less predictable storytelling. It’s goofy stuff, but it’s an enjoyably light story that’s designed to keep the audience guessing. And it’s just about impossible to watch without wondering: <em>Would I do any better under these circumstances? </em>—<em>TR</em></p>

Between crappy AI replacing real humans and billionaires controlling more and more of the world, things seem a bit bleak, I’d say. So<em> Mullet Madjack</em>, a new retro-inspired, anime-themed, first-person shooter on PC, comes at a perfect time. It’s a fast-paced, action-packed game where you use guns, knives, kicks, and bombs to kill rich AI-powered robot billionaires who have turned humanity into a massive, ever-consuming audience. In other words, it’s catharsis in the form of a boomer shooter. Oh, and it’s also one of the best games I’ve played this year. </p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Out May 15 on Steam, <em>Mullet Madjack</em> tasks you with saving an influencer who has been kidnapped by evil robillionaires for reasons that are so good I won’t spoil them here. But suffice to say, these AI/human/robot hybrid monsters are greedy and dangerous, and will end up destroying everything if they aren’t stopped. And that’s where you come in.</p><p>You arrive at a large building and have to fight your way up each floor as quickly as you can to make sure the audience of humans watching the violence doesn’t get bored. You only have 10 seconds to finish each floor, but killing robots, blowing shit up, and doing cool moves gives you extra time. And if you fail, you die. But don’t worry, you’ll get another chance, albeit back on the bottom floor. The audience is never satisfied. Not even death is an escape in <em>Mullet Madjack</em>. Sorry.<br></p><p>Unlike other recent retro shooters—like <em>Boltgun </em>and <em>Hrot</em>—which are often about exploring open levels, finding secrets, and using keys to progress through locked doors, <em>Mullet Madjack</em> is different. This is a game all about speed and style. You’ll finish most levels without killing every AI-infused monster that you encounter. You just need to kill enough to stay alive, keep the timer going, and make it to the next exit.<br></p><h2 id="h4451"><a id=""></a>Less <em>Doom </em>and more <em>Hades</em></h2><p>And unlike other boomer shooters, you aren’t picking up new weapons or ammo. Instead, <em>Madjack </em>is structured more like a roguelike. Between each floor, you get a chance to unlock an upgrade or new ability. As you defeat super-rich robots every 10 floors, the lore of <em>Mullet Madjack </em>is revealed more and more, though I didn’t need that carrot on the stick to keep playing.<br></p><p>Even if <em>Mullet Madjack</em> didn’t have killer, ‘80s anime style and fantastic worldbuilding, I’d still recommend it in a heartbeat because the combat is just that good. It starts out simple enough, but as you work your way up the tower more layers are added, including useful shortcuts, platforming, weapon upgrades, acid floors, double jumps, and more cool shit I don’t want to spoil here.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="430bf5c0b12707cf4efec5dc020e8f52" data-recommend-id="image://430bf5c0b12707cf4efec5dc020e8f52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone buying upgrades in Mullet Madjack.

Your main character is constantly shouting anti-capitalist chants at the start of each level, some of which make sense, and others that feel like maybe this mullet-sporting gun-nut isn’t all there.<br></p><p><em>Madjack </em>also includes nods to old video games and late ‘80s entertainment, including turn-based RPGs and Tamagotchis. There’s truly something for everyone.<br></p><p>In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have <em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun! </p><p><em>Mullet Madjack </em>launches on Steam on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-reveals-the-finals-isn%E2%80%99t-performing-as-well-as-expected.870411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-the-finals-not-performing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In December, Embark Studios shadowdropped The Finals, a high-octane, destructive first-person shooter with some hero elements worked in. It pulled in a substantial audience overnight, reaching a peak player count of a quarter of a million users on Steam alone. This free-to-play shooter was regarded as a ‘major franchise pillar’ for Nexon, the game’s publisher and great expectations rose following a successful launch window.</p>



<p>However, in the most recent financial update from Nexon, it was confirmed numerous times that The Finals isn’t hitting expected targets and that work is underway to find out why that is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-hitting-the-mark">Not Hitting The Mark</h2>



<p>In the financial letter published recently by Nexon, it was revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The launch of Season 2 in March created a short-lived increase in player metrics but delivered lower-than-expected retention and revenue. The Embark team is working with our Korea-based Live Operations team to understand and address the key issues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/RLCz/ukdB/n3z8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nexon admitted</a> that the solid results of other titles in its portfolio were ‘partially offset’ by The Finals’ shortfall. Ultimately, The Final’s failure to deliver on expectations meant that the publisher reported lower revenue than it was originally targeting, despite reporting growth in MapleStory and rampant success from DAVE THE DIVER.</p>



<p>It wasn’t all bad, though. Nexon’s report confirmed that The Finals pushed consolidated MAUs up on a year-over-year basis. The free-to-play nature of the game was always bound to attract a vast audience, and even the teething issues caused by rampant cheating weren’t enough to keep away a core following.</p>



<p>That’s not the end of the story, though. Nexon expects growth for The Finals, particularly with the game’s third season dropping in June.</p>

<p>On May 16, Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut will be released on PC, bringing this incredible samurai-themed title to an entirely new market. It’s the complete package, featuring the base game, the Iki Island expansion, and the game’s cooperative multiplayer mode, Legends – which has been the source of a little controversy in recent days.</p>



<p>Valve has just published an article on the Steam site detailing everything you need to know about the launch of Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-tsushima">Back to Tsushima</h2>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was released on PlayStation 4 in 2020 and ported to PlayStation 5 shortly after. It was a remarkably well-received game, boasting an immersive, emotional story, beautiful visuals, and a massive, open world that was bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore every corner of it. Now, almost four years after the game was released, it’s being made available on PC.</p>



<p>There’s one point of contention, though. To play Legends on Ghost of Tsushima on PC, you’ll need to make or link a PSN account, which is the exact controversy that caused a nightmare of a response from the Helldivers 2 community in the last week or so. It instantly makes a portion of the game unavailable in every country where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is enough of a sticking point, even if you get the game’s single-player mode to trawl through without any such restrictions.</p>



<p>That’s enough about that, though. Here’s when you can expect to start playing Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut:</p>



<ul>
<li>PDT: May 16, 8 AM</li>



<li>EDT: May 16, 11 AM</li>



<li>BST: May 16, 4 PM</li>



<li>CEST: May 16, 5 PM</li>



<li>JST: May 17, 12 AM</li>



<li>BRT: May 16, 12 PM</li>



<li>AEST: May 17, 1 AM</li>
</ul>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is available for pre-load now.</p>



<p>It was also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4188987871078331985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Valve</a> that Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut can be enjoyed on the Steam Deck – as well as ‘similar handheld gaming PCs’. However, it’s marked as ‘unsupported’ on the Steam Deck owing to the PSN integration requirement for Legends.</p>

                <p>The pandemic "meme stock" run is the stuff of history books and Hollywood movies these days, and now one of the figures central to that phenomenon has made a grand return. Keith Gill, better known by his online handle Roaring Kitty, posted a meme of a player sitting forward in his chair on X/Twitter, which usually indicates that the poster is going to take the match seriously--and it appears to have had a tangible effect on GameSpot's stock price.</p><p dir="ltr">In the day since that announcement, Roaring Kitty has posted a large number of videos to X, mostly depicting hype-up sequences from popular movies and TV shows, such as Troy, Peaky Blinders, and Marvel movies. According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/meme-roaring-kitty-gamestop-amc-stocks-401916acd3715d35cc0220143b26b2ac" rel="nofollow ">AP</a>, Gill's return appears to have triggered a large run on GameStop stock, which surged more than 74% on Monday. As of this writing, the stock price has settled around $50, almost three times its pre-Roaring Kitty return price of around $17. The run also caused sale of the stock to be temporarily halted multiple times on Monday.</p><p dir="ltr">Gill is the main character of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-meme-stock-movie-dumb-money-out-now-on-digital/1100-6519129/">Dumb Money</a>, a Hollywood film that highly dramatizes the story of the GameStop short squeeze. Though the film received positive reviews from critics, it was not a box-office success, earning roughly $20.7 million against a reported $30 million budget from its theatrical run. The ballooning value of GameStop and other stocks in January 2021 had outsized effects on the financial industry, with trading platforms like Robinhood being hit with class-action lawsuits after the broker prevented its clients from making GME purchases. A US House committee even held a congressional hearing on the phenomenon.</p>

And that has allowed me to swing back and forth and do very divergent things. It’s made my career very fulfilling for me, because I get to stretch and change. I don’t ever feel like I’m in a box, because I get to express myself in such different ways. It’s rare! It’s a rare thing to be able to do that, so I’m quite grateful that my career started that way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Much like an interactive video game story, you and I are now presented with two paths – the path of the mature antihero with a lot of action combat, and the path of the fun… shall I say family-friendly (laughs) kind of protagonist! So let’s explore this half of Winifred Phillips. The journey with LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy and SimAnimals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Let’s start with LittleBigPlanet, because that’s been a big part of your life as a game composer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s so true, yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And again, those are also big games that require multiple composers, but – you know – Winifred Phillips keeps popping up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I’ve really been happy to be a part of the LittleBigPlanet franchise. I’ve been with the team since the LittleBigPlanet 2 game, and I’ve worked on lots of the different iterations of the game –&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/sWCr_l-r1GM?si=sIxV2Odwa6-TcCrL">LittleBigPlanet 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Xa2WPVhUd8s?si=Dm4Oo_X4vFUyOufg">LittleBigPlanet 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hGp8L767-ro?si=ssidQ-GSnI6GZ6Fz">LittleBigPlanet Cross Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Tjof378y_Dg?si=2brhFAEClH3XbhEX">LittleBigPlanet Toy Story</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TmAMsVwVm4">LittleBigPlanet Karting</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/eja8eaq3Z0U?si=1faFUBMUMQ-w6tTf">LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and now&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6E41RxN5oS8?si=Og0UZ1GwWN5bj23f">Sackboy A Big Adventure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So it’s been amazing! One of the things that’s really neat about working with the LittleBigPlanet games, and now the Sackboy games, is that we’re encouraged as composers to be eclectic and strange, and try new things. It’s all about mash-ups – about throwing together ideas and instruments that you wouldn’t normally hear within the same track, within the same genre. Just challenging expectations. In the world of Sackboy (for people who aren’t familiar with the game) – you’re playing as this little knitted doll-like character with very loose arms and legs who runs around these environments that look like they might be craft projects. They’re full of buttons, and cardboard, and little stickers, and cut-out clouds, and everything seems like a pop-up book where things fold out. It’s got that feeling to it. It’s enormously whimsical. So the idea of it being crafty is woven into the core of what LittleBigPlanet is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sackboy lives in Craftworld, so everything is powered by the imagination. That philosophy of Play Create Share (which is at the core of the LittleBigPlanet franchise, and now the Sackboy games) – that also informs the creation of the music. Because the music has to have this idea of throwing together disparate elements. Letting loose your creative juices. Doing things that you wouldn’t have expected would come out of yourself. That’s been tremendously exciting for me. I love how supportive the team at the LittleBigPlanet franchise are of those of us who are creating music for it. Really being urged to stretch and try new things and create new art for their games. I think that’s part of why the games are so enchanting for players. I think everybody really feels that spirit of creative play. It informs every part of these games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s a really beautiful opportunity to always be challenged to do the unorthodox. What has been the funniest, strangest, weirdest, most outlandish experiment anyone has ever asked you to pull off? Or you have asked yourself to pull off?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Oh, I think that would have to be Victoria’s Lab from LittleBigPlanet 2. It was one of the first tracks I was asked to create for the LittleBigPlanet franchise. The level stars Victoria, and she is sort of a manic inventor! At least, this is how she was initially conceived by the development team. She’s very creative, as the whole franchise is, but she’s also dangerous, and she’s creating all these robots, and she’s super unpredictable! So the music was supposed to have that flavor to it – essentially finding the danger of Victoria as an unpredictable manic character. That was fun for me!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So I started looking into things that I could do, and I was combining rock guitar with silly vocals and beatboxing and calliope and all kinds of wild instrumentation – pop bottles, and found-sound, and sound design. Just a sense of everything that you could imagine thrown at it! Trying to make that feel really unexpected and surprising. Plus it is very much a vocal driven track. There’s sort of an operatic lead vocal that essentially personifies Victoria herself, and then there’s an almost Andrew Sisters type vocal group behind her that’s keeping an energy going with all of this syllabic singing that’s happening. A lot of elements went into it! It’s almost chaotic, but you have to structure it so that it feels satisfying, so that you can follow the line. And of course, Victoria’s voice really creates a central point of focus. So that was immense fun to create.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwzx9l3tgko" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Then, I submitted it to the team, and it was implemented into the game. As a composer, you don’t have as direct an experience participating in that process. I get a chance to see early concept art and video of the game in action, but I don’t get to see the final product while it’s being implemented. But then later, I was contacted by the audio director of the project, who let me know that they had revised the level a bit – specifically to accommodate the music that I had submitted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s amazing!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Incredibly rare! It’s an incredibly rare thing to happen, which I was dumbfounded by. Because when I finally saw the level, not only was she a manic inventor with lots of maniacal robots rolling around, but she’s also now a baker! And we have cookies and cakes and cherries and icing dripping from walls, and roses! It was a garden, there were all sorts of roses everywhere! I think they had keyed in on the whimsy that had been woven with the danger. They’d represented both elements that were in the music, represented them visually in the gameplay – and it was amazing to me!</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCL2J5ttX_4" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I never felt quite as centrally a part of the development process as I felt for that one, because the music essentially had a chance to participate in the game design – without me knowing that was what was going to happen. But it did! And it was just so fulfilling! So that’s a really deeply meaningful memory for me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That is beautiful! That may be one of my favorite stories! Whenever I hear a composer say that the development team actually changed their level, or changed their game, in response to the music, that to me really speaks volumes about the power of music in video games! Even before it reaches the gamers! That’s just fabulous! I love hearing that! It’s amazing!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It was really amazing for me. It is a rare thing to happen. And understandably so! Game development is a very complex process. It involves a lot of people. They can be big teams! And it’s a complicated mechanism that’s being created. It has to respond to player actions, so it’s very complex in terms of its internal construction. The idea of a composer being thrown into that mix and influencing the structure of the design is a rare thing, and it’s really special for me that that happened there. So I have very warm feeling about that particular game, and the LittleBigPlanet and Sackboy folks as a whole. They’re magnificent people!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And in that complex machinery of game development, you decided at some point to help break it down for other people hoping to write video game music, with a book aptly titled&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://a.co/jhK0uR6">A Composer’s Guide to Game Music</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">! What drove that decision for you? To say, “hey you know what? I need to put this out there!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. I think part of it was – there wasn’t a book in existence at that time that was pointed towards composers, with a focus just on that discipline. There were books that existed, that would help out someone who was trying to break into the industry, who was a musician or composer… but they tended to focus on the entire discipline of game audio. And a lot of the discussion focused on the art and technology associated with sound design, and audio design. That end of things. Which of course is useful for a composer to know – but it doesn’t really address the questions that we have about what we want to achieve as game composers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When you’re playing a game, there are two things you’re essentially hearing. I’ll break it down a little further. Three things you’re essentially hearing. You’re hearing the atmosphere of the environment you’re existing in. Say you’re wandering an outdoor location. You might be hearing the wind, and the birds, and any incidental sounds that might be happening there. And then there’s a second layer of sounds – sounds that you’re making, both in your movement, and by interacting with the environment. So they’re more incidental sounds that are being triggered by you – by your agency as a player. And that’s all essentially sound design. There’s a professional on the game development team who is responsible for that, so they’re creating all sorts of audio recordings that can be worked into the structure of the game and can be triggered by your actions, or by where you are in the game. So that essentially weaves an aural universe around you. And then there’s the third element – that’s the music. That music typically tends to be what’s called&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/non-diegetic">non-diegetic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It doesn’t exist in the fiction, so you don’t think the music you’re hearing is coming from something in the environment, unless there’s some overt radio sitting there, and the music is supposed to be coming out of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Like the old Tomb Raider!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Right, absolutely, yeah! That’s a good example of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/diegetic">diegetic music</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in action! But most of the time, it’s non-diegetic. It’s music that’s kind of like a film score or television score. It’s weaving an emotional tapestry for you. It’s giving you a sense of emotional momentum. Maybe it’s helping you out, in terms of what’s important that you need to pursue. It’s telling the story with a musical language, so that you can remain emotionally involved even though a game is typically a longer experience than a film or a tv show – which tends to be a single sitting type affair. Whereas a video game can be tens or hundreds of hours. And music really plays a very important role in keeping a player emotionally invested, and helping them to hang onto the thread of narrative when they are in the game for that long a period of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So it’s an entirely different discipline. It has its own technical challenges, in terms of getting the music to feel like it’s flowing with your own experience as a player, so that it’s essentially telling your story. So that is a challenge for game composers, and we try all sorts of different techniques and technologies to make that happen. But when I was first coming up as a young game composer, most of the books were focusing on the first two kinds of audio you’d experience: the incidental sounds and the environmental sounds. That’s mostly what these books were about. They might talk about music, but not a lot! I mean, it didn’t feel like the heart of the book was there, it was just kind of an ancillary part of the overall thing. And I kind of yearned for something that was going to guide me, and it didn’t really exist at the time. Around that time, I started thinking maybe I’m the person to write that book, because it didn’t exist then. This was actually right before I was hired for the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4TNER1Zgw">Assassin’s Creed Liberation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> project. I had started working on the book, and I had an agreement with the MIT Press to turn in a draft of that book, and then I was hired for Assassin’s Creed Liberation. Which was actually unexpected! And so I set the book aside to work on that project, which was massive and amazing! And working with Ubisoft was just world-changing for me!</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfpfhztOBVI" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Then I went back and completely rewrote the book, because of course there was a lot that I had learned from that, and a lot that I wanted to share!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! (Laughs) I can imagine!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! When I started thinking I wanted to write the book, that’s why I called it a Composer’s Guide to Game Music, because it really was important for me to stress that this book was pointed towards composers. At least at the time in which I was writing it, there weren’t any books that were pointed specifically towards composers. I think that now as time has gone on, there are more books out there, and there are more that are pointed towards composers, and thinking about our discipline, and the kinds of questions that we ask as we’re trying to do our work. But at the time, there really wasn’t anything very specific, so that’s why I wrote it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>We’ve reached the end of part two of my interview with the Game Show’s Meena Shamaly.&nbsp; I’ll be continuing this transcript in part three, so watch this space!&nbsp; And if you’re enjoying this interview transcript, please tune in to Meena’s series, airing every friday on ABC Classic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/live/classic">and online via the ABC Classic web site!</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The hijinks can get so out of hand and unique in this game that the playthroughs themselves can become a unique collectible that players can trade with one another.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer sat down with Nico Papalia, the game’s creator, to talk about how their budding experience in GameMaker would shape the game’s minigame combat and systems, what thoughts went into creating a game where no two playthroughs should be the same, and how to turn player saves into a collectible (with some inspiration from the popularity of the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> is a playful, minigame-filled RPG romp through a ridiculous world. Can you tell us a bit about what inspired the creation of this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nico Papalia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I started </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while learning GameMaker for fun during the pandemic. A great friend of mine used it to make games of his own, and I thought it could be a fun activity. I ended up falling in love with the feeling of creating the game, and it snowballed into what we have here!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I grew up on the GameBoy Advance and older consoles, and those games were immediately what came to mind in terms of what kind of game I wanted to make. I wanted to recreate that era of my life when my friends, cousins, and I would cluelessly navigate games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Emerald</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (even down to giving </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the same resolution as the GBA). Most of us could barely read at that point, and the ones who could had no idea how to progress the story. So, we all kind of aimlessly played around the same part of the game, doing virtually nothing, but that experience was vital to the creation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—the wonder of not knowing what’s next or what else the game contains was enough to keep exploring, playing, and having fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The humor and overall vibes of the game are a pretty good reflection of how my friends and I interact. I had a ritual of waking up and just adding or writing whatever I thought was funny that morning and never really changing it; the whole thing was built intuitively. Whatever I was interested in at the time or any character I had a cool idea for, I would chase and create alongside the game’s composer, Arp, and we’d bring it to life. This did make it difficult to tie it all together at times, but I don’t think I can make games any other way.</span></p><p>Images via Top Hat Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into its art style? How did you work to design a visual theme that would immediately draw the player into the silly mood of the game's world?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before working on video games, I studied transformational anatomy and my main interest was drawing with graphite; when transitioning into pixel art for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my first visuals were absolutely terrible. The game looked like hot garbage! Honestly, it just took a long time of actually doing it, the occasional studies, and a lot of mental work on the sprites until the game’s art style came together consistently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later on, I did plan very specifically not to make each biome too RPG-cliche. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you reach a mountain biome—in this biome, like several others in the game, I wanted to add a twist that separated it from being just a normal mountain. I tried to add a magic twist and make the rocks look like they contained galaxies with stars in them to give it more of an interesting look. Many of my biomes and scenes were inspired by Adventure Time and the way the land of Ooo is designed, too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your combat system is filled with many, many dodging minigames for players to enjoy, giving combat a lively and often surprisingly hilarious feel. What appealed to you about creating a combat system like this?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Papalia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: To be completely honest, I originally wanted to create a game that worked like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The only problem was that I had absolutely no idea how to even begin creating that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought, “Okay, let me take a step down and create a battle system similar to the mainline Pokémon games…” The only problem was that I had absolutely no idea how to begin creating that, either.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When beginning, my programming skills and knowledge of GameMaker were so poor that I would create all of my dialogue in Photoshop, export it as an image, and then import it into GameMaker as a graphic. Changing dialogue was a nightmare. What I did know how to do was how to make things move around, so I began to make what I imagined a Pokémon battle would look like. Instead of turn-based combat, I wanted to use real-time action and dodging to imagine what the enemy’s attacks would look like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, as my skills and knowledge grew, I wanted to expand from that and more into a space inspired by games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WarioWare</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I did this through the game’s many REACT minigames used to befriend the opponents—in the future in any games I make, I want to reach into this category even more!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you tell us about how you designed some of the minigames? Any particular favorites you're especially proud of, or that never fail to make a player chuckle?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Papalia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Usually when designing a character, I have a whole mental plan in mind. I really think about who they are, what they sound like, things they say, and eventually what situation they find themselves meeting the player in. One of my personal favorite battles is the one against McFishness, the bodybuilding squid. You meet him in his gym and undergo his ultimate training program before beginning his battle; during the battle, you need to mash the correct keys to lift up a dumbbell all the way to the top of a bicep, and once you do that, you have to complete a DDR-inspired rhythm minigame to pull off bodybuilding poses with your fresh new pump.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another favorite of mine is Aerosol’s battle, where you clumsily paint your own picture using your movement controls (which always turns out looking pretty jacked up, as you could imagine). Some other favorites of mine would be Giga Franklin’s "Hoo! Ha!" thing he does while you complete his battle, Meesha's and Flipper's battles have also been fan favorites after appearing in the spin-off demo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody: Thunder Goober’s Personality Dungeon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You mention that choice is an integral part of the game. Many games have made such claims, but on your store page, you go further, stating "Your story will unfold based on your decisions, to the degree of which cannot be replicated by any other player." Can you tell us a bit about how you are weaving so many decisions into the game's world and making them matter? How are you creating a game where player experiences can be this vastly different?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea of choose-your-own-adventure interested me specifically because I wanted to make an experience that was unique and special to each player. It seems like many RPGs produced now follow what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Undertale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought to the scene in having multiple pathways, your decisions affecting your morality, and being treated differently based on the decisions you made through the story. I wanted to expand on this idea and turn it into a much more extreme version of the concept; many players who play new RPGs expect them to function exactly like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Undertale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I wanted to shake up that preconceived notion and introduce them with something that would catch them off guard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I provided players with multiple different angles to attack each scenario individually. Players can do very little and complete the game, or they can do a whole lot. The story happens modularly—I often compare the game’s story to a tree with branches of varying sizes and thicknesses that weave in different directions and angles. There are definitely enough decisions, big and small, that I’m confident no two players would ever achieve the same exact playthrough (then receive the same Rhapsody). I also tried to put all of this completely in the player’s hands—the only RNG present is during the game’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired personality quiz, where the selected questions are random.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody features a Rhapsody system, an online social element that involves collectible and tradeable save states. Where did the idea for this system come from? What sparked the idea of being able to trade saves with other players?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of my ideas and concepts came from studying how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s first generation was made and how its mechanics impacted its popularity. As a huge </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fan, I knew the feeling players had when completing a playthrough with a Pokémon and having a special bond to the character you own; it serves as a token or relic of your adventure through a region that reminded you of all of the challenges and shenanigans that happened during that time. I wanted to somehow combine the feeling of having a special Pokémon of your own with which players build a relationship with and cherish but without the actual Pokémon, since I was making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and definitely don’t have the rights to add Poliwhirl into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I spent a long time thinking about how I would provide players with something special, too. I also had this "Rhapsody" idea, but it wasn't really fleshed out yet. I had no idea how to piece everything together and give players a reason to play my game more than once, and to reward them for doing so. I wanted to bring players together, give them a reason to talk about their experiences, to remember Athenian Rhapsody, and for the experience, frankly, not to end. Just because they finished the game, I didn’t want their experience to be completely over. Visions of people showing up to events and parties with their Gameboys to collect special event Pokémon flashed around in my head, and I wanted to create something similar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember a lot of days staring into space at the gym, trying to craft up what eventually became the Rhapsody system—a player’s save file upon finishing the game turns into a highly customizable postcard that contains the entire adventure! It’ll even have a photo you took from the actual game on it (thanks, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Earthbound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">)!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember pitching the idea to my publishers at Top Hat Studios—walls of text, diagrams, slideshows; I was all in. Luckily, they were VERY interested in the idea and wanted to work to help me achieve this vision and eventually develop the system’s networking functions which allow players to trade and collect Rhapsodies cross-platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A Bohemian chic Rhapsody">A Bohemian chic Rhapsody</h2><p>Images via Top Hat Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How do you turn save states and player progress into collectibles? How do you make these saves appealing to collect and trade?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When a player finishes a game, they’re taken to a menu where they can customize the appearance of the Rhapsody they are about to create; they can add badges, postmarks, choose a paper color, pattern, and more to go alongside their uniquely branded postcard. Inside that postcard, a huge amount of crucial information in regards to what you actually did during your playthrough is present—which followers you used the most, the least, if you had irritable bowel syndrome and how many times you farted, if you tried to cure that IBS and failed (or succeeded), how many projectiles you were hit by, your favorite food, and more!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game also contains four different pathways players can take through the story, each giving them a different type of Rhapsody which are organized by colors: Fuchsia, Grey, Yellow, and Magenta. Players can combine any two, or THREE Rhapsodies of different types to create stacked Rhapsodies, which combine and compare all of the data present within the stack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It could be a very romantic first date to stack Rhapsodies together with someone else… Actually, that may be too serious for a first date—some people wait all the way until marriage to stack Rhapsodies with a significant other. It’s pretty serious since you can’t un-stack them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into developing the game in such a way that it turned game saves into something akin to trading cards? And how do these collectible saves affect the design of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The funny thing is that I actually did not design it with this in mind; I just created bits and pieces that I thought were funny at the time, and eventually, I had hours and hours of gameplay and content that I needed to make sense of. This was almost paralyzing when it came time to tie together the game’s endings and actually create the Rhapsody system. It took a lot of deep thought, thinking, planning, and asking myself questions about what I wanted players to experience, how I wanted them to feel, and what I wanted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Athenian Rhapsody</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to achieve in the long term.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, an idea started coming together on how an experience that felt like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s first generation of creature collecting and trading’s social features could work—trading Rhapsodies, collecting accolades, and most importantly, keeping your playthrough experiences for as long as you wish to cherish them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I tried very hard to visualize and explain this concept to my team and publishers Top Hat Studios; luckily, they were incredibly interested in the concept and wanted to help me achieve that vision. As I mentioned previously, I’ve learned to use GameMaker studios alongside the development of this game and the functionality of creating something that could connect every platform together to trade and collect Rhapsodies online was completely out of my reach at that time. Luckily, Top Hat Studios developed all of the inner mechanisms, which create user profiles, allow players to trade cross-platform, stack, and keep their Rhapsodies in the cloud. It took quite a bit of time to create these systems and ensure that they all worked together, but in the end, it came together exactly as we had planned initially.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once this concept was in place, I started fleshing out other things to make the Rhapsodies unique and adding more obscure gameplay elements to push their rarity. One great example of a gameplay mechanic specifically designed to be shown off on the Rhapsodies are the "Munchkins." Players can download a "Munchkin" in the options menu if they hold a strong connection from their system to Elysium, which should take about 5 or 6 minutes. Rhapsodies in their final form are highly customizable and feature a plethora of badges to choose from based on segments of the story that players have experienced.</span></p><p>Images via Top Hat Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To make these Rhapsodies truly stand out, you would need to give the player many, many, many things to do. What challenges come out of designing an RPG with an incredibly large amount of things players can do?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the challenge wasn't giving them enough things to do—it was stopping! I love creating funny little things that happen. Actually, I wish I could literally just do that… the cutscenes I create and story scenarios are sometimes purely for my own amusement. I’m not ashamed to say that when I replay the game I actually laugh at the dialogue that I forgot existed, which is pretty weird but also makes sense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges that came alongside this concept often came from having 16 party members. Wanting to create individual experiences for each of them within the story meant a lot of writing dialogue, individual cutscenes, and nitty-gritty work for each and every one of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some other challenges came from balancing the game and making sure the information was presented in a way that players could properly investigate and discover some of the more obscure pathways that will affect the Rhapsody as well.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="323" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you think about the phrase”<em>VALORANT </em>pro,” I guarantee that one of the first names you’ll think of Tyson ‘TenZ’ Ngo. While he may be the face of Riot’s FPS, the Sentinels star revealed that rival <em>CS2</em> does one thing “fundamentally better” than <em>VALORANT</em>: Gameplay mechanics. </p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">In a clip taken from TenZ’s stream, a viewer asked the pro player whether he preferred <em>CS2</em> or <em>VALORANT</em>, with the 23-year-old giving what may be a surprising answer to some considering he dropped <em>Counter-Strike</em> for Riot’s offering. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">“Honestly, I think <em>CS2</em> is more fun for me,” he stated. “I like the mechanical aspect in <em>CS</em>, and it felt like every single day you could get better at something mechanically, and that was a really appealing aspect of the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">“Plus, there’s so much cool sh*t you can do with the smokes, so you can get kind of creative sometimes. I do think you can unleash more of that creativity in VALORANT with certain comps or characters, but basically everything from a mechanical standpoint in <em>Counter-Strike</em> is just fundamentally better.”</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">He concluded: “You get less random kills. In my entire time playing <em>CS</em>, grinding up to become a pro player, I have probably gotten running or jumping headshot less times than a singular game of <em>VALORANT</em> in my life.”</p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Of course, the discussion between the two communities is never-ending, especially when you consider that some pro players ditched <em>CS</em> to go to <em>VALORANT</em>. While there were concerns that one could wipe out the other, it does feel like both have found their niche in the scene, with those who enjoy ultra-specific roles and outrageous abilities preferring <em>VALORANT</em>, while more classic FPS players like <em>CS2</em>‘s gameplay more. </p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">I certainly prefer <em>Counter-Strike</em>, and agree with TenZ’s comments about <em>VALORANT </em>feeling random. In the end, it’s just not my kind of FPS, but with both having their strengths as mentioned by TenZ, it’s good to have choice in the scene. </p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="false">We wouldn’t take these comments as a hint that he plans on returning to professional <em>CS</em> though, as he’s just come off the back of his second <em>VALORANT </em>VCT Masters trophy back in March. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prime Video and Crystal Dynamics have announced a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series, and a very well-respected writer is on board to both write and executive produce the project.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>website, the series will boast the involvement of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose work you might recognize from TV shows like&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and movies like&nbsp;<em>No Time to Die</em>.</p>
<p>The series will premiere exclusively on Prime Video, although we don't have an air date or even a tentative cast list for it yet, so it might be a while before we hear anything more about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-shadow-lara-totem.jpg?itok=mYvYUrwi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-shadow-lara-totem.jpg?itok=f2ULHbzE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Waller-Bridge says&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "a huge part of [her] life", and that if she could tell her teenage self she was working on a live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, she'd "explode".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether Waller-Bridge intends to hew closer to the darker, more realistic tone of Crystal Dynamics' reboot series or to the more swashbuckling and humorous tone struck by the original games (recently revived thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">Aspyr-led remasters</a>).</p>
<p>Given Phoebe Waller-Bridge's comments about her "teenage self", though, as well as her promise to make a "bats 'n all" series, it sounds like we might be moving slightly away from the tone of the 2013 reboot and the Alicia Vikander-starring 2018 movie.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all just speculation; no cast or story setup has been revealed yet, so we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly what kind of Lara we're getting in this series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-i-iii-remastered.jpg?itok=sQC3xLua 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-i-iii-remastered.jpg?itok=QAf55AZA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will Phoebe Waller-Bridge's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series be closer to the originals or the newer games in tone?</figcaption></figure><p>The new series is part of an effort to "develop additional&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>stories in streaming and film", according to the announcement, but don't worry; games aren't being left behind.</p>
<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-develop-and-globally-publish-tomb-raider-game">is in the works at Crystal Dynamics</a>, with Amazon providing "full support" as well as publishing the game around the world.</p>
<p>In the announcement for the new series, Amazon reiterates that the game is still in development, describing it as a "single-player, narrative-driven action-adventure" and the "next chapter to Lara Croft's legendary explorations".</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news on that, as well as the live-action series and all other things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>.</p>

Traditionally a walled-garden, new regulations by the European Union are blowing Apples’ grip on the iPhone ecosystem wide open, and the gaming emulator Delta was going to be a focal point on the AltStore. Then, in a surprise twist, Apple decided to uproot its longtime ban on emulators in the App Store just in time for Delta’s launch.</p><figure id="" data-id="3fdca3ae5bf47b414f51ab46113df588" data-recommend-id="image://3fdca3ae5bf47b414f51ab46113df588" data-format="jpg" data-width="910" data-height="512" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshots show the Delta layout on iPhone.

He and Gill have taken some credit for the historic rules change and attributed it to increased competition in Europe from things like the AltStore. “I think we’re gonna see a lot of this stuff where there’s a cool new type of app that exists only in Europe, and then Apple will change the rules to allow it in the App Store.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate the significance of the overnight revolution in retro gaming on iPhones in the U.S. Delta, which is open source and funded via Patreon subscribers who get early access to new features, became the top app, dethroned only weeks later after Krispy Kreme promised users free donuts. Testut and Gill said they were getting millions of downloads, their community blowing up with new users, and players were making memes on TikTok and swapping their favorite gaming memories.</p><h2 id="h4815"><a id=""></a>Moving from Napster to iTunes for ROMs</h2><p>People have been emulating games on PC and smartphones forever, but Testut and Gill see Apple’s embrace of Delta and other emulators as a potential watershed moment, one that could make it go mainstream and upend the current broken marketplace for retro gaming. Everyone who played <em>Animal Crossing</em> on the GameCube remembers the first time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/someone-discovered-a-hidden-feature-in-animal-crossings-1827591135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/someone-discovered-a-hidden-feature-in-animal-crossings-1827591135">they booted up<em> Super Mario Bros.</em> on a virtual NES inside their virtual house</a></span>. Five years later, the shop channel on the Wii allowed players to download other classics from Nintendo’s back catalog. Ever since, console manufacturers have kept tight control over how digital copies of their old games were sold and distributed, making them exclusive to their own hardware platforms.</p><p>“No one’s created the market for ROMs and that’s why we say this is just the Napster moment,” Gill said, citing the briefly ascendant file sharing app that completely changed the music industry. “We’re here with the player, somebody just needs to now make the iTunes store and just be like, ‘Hey, it’s 99 cents to get like every game you’ve ever had in your life.’”</p><figure id="" data-id="183cd9851026873323b37b68196f9a84" data-recommend-id="image://183cd9851026873323b37b68196f9a84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1092" data-height="770" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a Delta user playing with AirPlay on a TV.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Except that we know at least some companies would want to charge much more. While Nintendo hasn’t ported its retro library to smartphones, a publisher like Square Enix has. On iPhone you can buy <em>Secret of Mana </em>for $8, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> for $10, and <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> for $18, each with varying levels of upgraded features and graphics. Testut and Gill think a more reasonable ceiling might be $5 for SNES games and $10 for Nintendo 64 games (that’s how much <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> was on the Wii U eShop).<br></p><p>“We’re in just this weird phase right now,” Testut said. “It’s kind of like the pre-iTunes era [where] having these games is legal, just no one’s taking it upon themselves to make a storefront that people can just buy ROMs from and then play on anything. The moment one company does that, just sells their old games, then all of a sudden the question goes away and it’s like, ‘Oh, you can just sell old games and you can just play them on things that can play games, what a concept, just like other forms of media.’”</p><p>It’s unclear if game publishers will ever agree. Calling this the “Napster moment” implies that companies may not have a choice. It’s not clear how Nintendo itself will react. The<em> Mario</em> maker currently charges players a monthly subscription to access old games on Switch, and has been on the offensive more than ever against emulators and ROM sharing sites in recent years.</p><h2 id="h4816"><a id=""></a>Will Nintendo come after Delta too?</h2><p>Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-orders-rom-site-to-destroy-all-its-games-or-1847487357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-orders-rom-site-to-destroy-all-its-games-or-1847487357">won a lawsuit against RomUniverse in 2021</a></span> and the site was ordered to pay $2.1 million and destroy all of its games.

Gary Bowser, a man convicted for his association with a hacking group that enabled piracy on the 3DS, was sent to prison and will be paying off fines and legal fees <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">for the rest of his life</a></span>.</p><p>Testut said they haven’t heard from Nintendo at all and that in his years of working on emulation he knows what to avoid. He blames Yuzu getting targeted in part on the group’s promoting a paid Patreon, where users could access a version needed to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> early when it leaked prior to release. “Just don’t promote piracy and just really say, ‘Hey, this is a tool that can be used to play games you have.’”</p><figure id="" data-id="1ce4ffbea32712846ff35f7969f922f8" data-recommend-id="image://1ce4ffbea32712846ff35f7969f922f8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A GIF shows Delta for DS in action.

For Testut that’s playing <em>Super Mario Bros. 1</em> and <em>3</em> with his dad. For Gill it’s playing<em> Super Mario 64</em> and <em>Super Mario Tennis </em>with his cousins. Having traded in lots of games to GameStop over the years like so many of us, he’s been building back up his retro collection beginning with SNES games, and was lucky to snag things like <em>Chrono Trigger</em> for just $50-60 prior to the explosion in vintage game prices. The beloved Square Enix RPG now goes for over $200 for the cartridge alone.<br></p><p>While <em>Chrono Trigger</em> is available on modern platforms, lots of lesser-known retro games aren’t. Testut and Gill said preservation is a big part of why they hope emulation on the iPhone takes off. “There’s all these old games that just get lost to time because no one’s bothered to find a way to bring them up to date,” Gill said. “They’re just in deep IP disputes and who even owns the rights to this game from the early ‘90s and stuff. There’s all these little things that should exist and be held on to because people worked really hard on them, and then they just kind of get lost to time. I’m sure if I was working on those games, I would want to see them still be played if people wanted to play them.”</p><p>DS games are the perfect case study. Reliant on dual screen displays and touch screen mechanics, only a handful have been ported to the Switch. Smartphones offer the ideal substitute, with tablets like the iPad offering an even better experience thanks to the extra screen real estate. Testut recently finished <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C59K1SlOeKD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C59K1SlOeKD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all of <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em></a></span> on his Apple TV using AirPlay to stream it from his phone to make it feel like he was playing on the Wii U. The pair are working on reducing latency and adding other features as well, like remote peer-to-peer multiplayer.</p><h2 id="h4817"><a id=""></a>Retro gaming without DRM</h2><p>Where will it end? Testut said that although Apple doesn’t define what it means by “retro” in its new rules on emulators, additional programs needed to run more advanced games like from the PS2 era remain banned. Thus, while<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a PS1 emulator was added to the store just this week</a></span>, it’s unlikely retro gaming enthusiasts on the platform will be able to move to <em>Grand Theft Auto 3 </em>or <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> anytime soon. Maybe in five years Apple’s definitions of retro will broaden to include them as well.</p><p>The barriers to a full-blown ROM marketplace remain more challenging. That idea of selling files that are easily copied and given-away has historically led to draconian Digital Rights Management (DRM). Recently, game preservation proponents like former PlayStation executive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/ex-sony-boss-shawn-layden-advises-readygg-as-it-raises-4m-for-web3-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/ex-sony-boss-shawn-layden-advises-readygg-as-it-raises-4m-for-web3-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Layden have suggested</a></span> blockchain technology could be used to streamline those requirements. Testut disagrees.</p><p>“I really think that the actual solution here is a DRM-free thing to say, ‘Hey, this is just an mp3 file, it’s just a JPEG, it’s just a bigger file that you can consume,’” he said, physically recoiling when I mention crypto currency and distributed ledgers. “And then maybe beyond that, we could figure something else out, but we’ve got to start there or else we’re just gonna lock it down before it’s ever real I think.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new series will see Phoebe Waller-Bridge of Fleabag write and executive produce. Crystal Dynamics and Jenny Robbins will also executive produce the show. </p>



<p>“If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she’d explode,” Waller-Bridge said.&nbsp;<em>“</em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.”</p>



<p>“I’m so happy to announce that we have ordered the epic, globetrotting series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;from the incredibly gifted Emmy-award winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge and the team at Crystal Dynamics,” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, said. “Fans and newcomers can look forward to exhilarating adventures that honor the legacy of this iconic character.”</p>



<p>There currently is no time table for the series’ debut. When it releases, however, it will premiere exclusively on Prime Video. It’s also part of Amazon MGM Studios and dj2’s first-look deal that will bring more Tomb Raider stories to both film and streaming.</p>

He claims one of the biggest red flags you can encounter is the presence of recoup clauses that deny "critical cash flow" post-launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although he understands why recoup terms are still commonplace—he claims the idea of using them has simply become "ingrained" in the industry—he believes publishers should seriously reconsider leveraging terms that place developers at risk.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we went by what I thought was fair, it would eliminate too many good publishers. Because I believe, fundamentally, that one horrible thing that exists within the industry is the use of recoup terms in contracts between publishers and developers," he says. "These are just any term that allows the publisher to recover the vast majority, or all, of the sales before the developer gets anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender, who previously worked as a lawyer, claims recoup terms make "no sense" because one of the fundamental principles of sensible contracts lies in allocating risk to the party best placed to shoulder that risk. "That's an efficient contract," he says. "And publishers can bear the risk of individual projects succeeding or failing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have many of those projects. It's not a big deal. It's not like every project has to be a financial success for the publisher. But developers have one or maybe a couple of projects. They can't easily bear that risk. So, just from a matter of contract theory, it's fundamentally stupid to have recoup terms where publishers protect all of their downside risks and recover all the money first."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Manor Lords publisher says recoup terms harm both developers and players">Manor Lords publisher says recoup terms harm both developers and players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains recoup terms can make it difficult for developers to find their footing and stabilize once their project hits shelves by blocking cash flows. Post-launch, teams will need funds to retain workers and ensure they can continue supporting their project, but Bender says recoup terms can make that difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why he feels they're also terrible for players, because they remove the ability (and incentive) for developers to support their projects. "How many wonderful game projects that could have still done well after release were buried under a recoup term that wouldn't go away? The developer has to make choices. They've got to take care of their staff, so they can't [do that] if there's no money coming in because of some giant recoup," continues Bender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He acknowledges that recoup terms don't inherently make a publisher bad. "Even good publishers have them in their contracts," he says. "[But] this is a silly way to do business." He feels a clean revenue split is a better solution and says that's essentially the standard at Hooded Horse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our standard terms [...] where we're just doing the marketing and distribution and all of that, we have a very simple ask: 35 percent for us and 65 percent for the developer. There's no recoup or anything else. It's that split. It never changes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would challenge [other publishers] to go through and actually analyze the alternative hypotheticals and ask whether instead of having recoup terms, which are really damaging, they can think of two things as alternatives. Suppose there's a publisher that says 'okay, I want 100 percent recoup on my costs and then I want to get 30 percent long-term' [compared to] another another publisher that just says 'I just want 35 percent any no recoup.' That is a much better relationship for the developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If from a publisher's perspective, you then analyze your entire portfolio and say 'okay, let me go back for years and pretend I never did recoup terms, but instead asked for a tiny increase on that long-term rate. Let me see how I would have done.' I bet most of them would discover they would have been better off financially."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

As he explained how the game systems evolved, it was fascinating to hear how so much of what makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> special and unique wasn't all that different from any other game, but by applying familiar systems to creative director Alex Dracott's vision of a spooky driving game in the Olympic Peninsula, the team was able to make a driving game unlike any other on the market.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-exceptionally-cool-ways-pacific-drive-used-randomized-terrain-to-shape-player-goals" target="_self">Randomizing terrain with Houdini to shape player goals in Pacific Drive</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From car souls to health bars and hands-on maintenance mechanics, Rosen had a lot to say about why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> just "works." Here are lessons from the experience that can help make your game stand out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Giving a car a soul helps track all the variables that can impact it">Giving a car a soul helps track all the variables that can impact it</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, let's dig into that "soul."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s code there lays an Unreal blueprint called "IA_Internal_Soul" that tracks the aforementioned quirks and all of the car's stats. "It's the central repository for all things 'car'" he said. By storing information like how far the car has travelled, the game can calculate wear and tear on car parts and generate obstacles the player is (or maybe isn't) ready to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a useful method for calculating where "friction" needs to be applied in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experience. Rosen is very particular about "friction" in design—he has strong opinions about survival games (which he described as generally being 'time management' games), and how friction in the player experience that slows them down and makes them fiddle with a game mechanic can be a core part of making sure the game is fun.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trick with applying this common concept in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that the friction is often applied where players wouldn't expect to find it in similar kinds of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A good example of this is in the car's customization system—the very first design feature Rosen tackled when he joined the team. When he was asked to consult on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, customizing the player's car took place in a menu. It allowed players to quickly swap and repair parts in a quick and efficient manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Rosen's gut instinct was that this system was too quick, and too efficient. Making the player a "Zone mechanic" (i.e a mechanic who has to master the weird physics of the "Zone") was a core pillar of the game design, and swapping car parts in a menu was easy, but not necessarily fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pressed the team to switch to a customization and repair loop that involved walking around the car, making parts at a work bench, and physically repairing it with tools. The process is slower, but it helps drive player investment in the car and nudges the player into thinking like a real-world mechanic. If you've played the game and wandered around the garage thinking "alright, the car needs this, where did I leave that part..." then you've felt the impact of Rosen's choice of friction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Rosen didn't see the game as just being about making easy tasks hard. Though the quirk system is meant to let every part of the car's functions interact with each other—steering, parking brakes, headlights, radio, etc.—combinations that get in the way of core gameplay are downplayed or even shut off altogether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, if the player takes the car out of park, it shouldn't go back into park. "It's a driving game, you have to be able to drive," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avoiding the 'plateau of stability'">Avoiding the 'plateau of stability'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "survival" part of "driving survival" game is actually creates a surprising clash in Rosen's design sensibilities. To put it bluntly, Rosen hates survival games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay "hates" might be a strong word—he doesn't find them to be evil or anything—but he doesn't enjoy playing most of them. To him survival games operate on a spectrum running from "treehugger" to "tree-puncher" spectrum.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A 'tree-puncher' game is a game where your entire relationship to the world is extractive," he said, an echo of many critiques of games that reinforce a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/games-and-colonialism/">colonialist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" ideology with how players interact with the world. "Treehugger games" are games where the environment has its own ecology and the player isn't at the center of it. "So much of those experiences are about [the player] figuring out how they fit into that ecology, seeing something new and poking it with a stick...to see what happens," he said. "I find that those experiences are so much more interesting."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A fascinating late twist in development that sealed the deal on the "treehugger" design philosophy had to do with item damage. With only a few months until the game had to ship, Rosen became suddenly convinced that one new mechanic would make the game sing: health bars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Originally, when players wanted to harvest an item, they would select the tool, navigate to the resource, an animation would play, and the resource would break apart, leaving harvestable items behind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something tugged at Rosen's instincts, and he decided to test out a new idea: giving all items in the game health bars that could be chipped away at using tools or damage from the environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It opened up all of these cool interactions," he said. If players are in dire straits and missing a key tool to harvest resources, they can use other sources of damage dealing to get what they need. If they don't have the buzzsaw-like "scrapper" item used to cut through metal, they can just ram a car into another car instead.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a harvesting mechanic, which may feel overly extractive at first glance, but it also creates more in-world interactions that exist without the player. If a stray explosion from a Tourist (creepy exploding mannequins that move when the player isn't looking) blows up a resource in the environment, players can find useful items in the debris.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Tree puncher" games also regularly bring players to what Rosen called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24099909/open-world-survival-crafting-games-2024">the plateau of stability.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" It's a state of gameplay where the threats that first pressured a player to gather resources and craft items aren't threats anymore. There may be some gameplay to pursue after that—using the game's tools to build a massive settlement or monument of some type—but without that tension, he feels that such games become far less interesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outer Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game that fits the "treehugger" archetype, and he was surprised to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> compared to it in the media coverage around the game. "In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense. It's that same sort of discovery process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game designers chasing market trends right now have every reason to chase that "tree puncher" trend. Players want to gather resources and build big bases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But when you follow Rosen and Ironwood Studios down the path of the treehugger, you might make a game where the player hauls ass in a station wagon through the woods, running from a weird floating orb that wants to steal their bumper.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the majority of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-update-7-reduces-file-size-by-25gb-while-adding-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s post-launch content updates</a> have included flashy new tracks and such, Update 8 foregoes anything of the sort. Instead, it’s quality-of-life o’clock, and Turn 10 aims to deliver. Included are an improved racing AI, vinyl editing boons, a revision of safety ratings, and heaps more.</p> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As usual, <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s Update 8 comes alongside a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new seasonal content revision</a>, this time focusing on vehicles that walk the knife’s edge between being a full-blooded track monster and a production-tier road car. One of the most exciting new cars on the roster is the legendary Ginetta G40 Junior, to illustrate what you ought to be expecting. Oh, and lest we forget: Mobil 1 is celebrating its 50th anniversary by partnering up with <em>Forza Motorsport</em> for a series of themed Rivals events and more.</p>

While Update 8, specifically, isn’t as transformative of an upgrade as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 6, which totally reworked the game’s caRPG systems</a>, it is quite massive when it comes to quality-of-life improvements and the general quality of gameplay.</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">Notably, here’s just a short list of some key improvements that have made their way into <em>Forza Motorsport</em> with Update 8:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false"> <li>Vinyl Material Tool has been added to the livery editor, allowing you to define how matte or glossy your vinyl design will be.</li> <li>Tire Wear Scale option for private multiplayer and free-play modes.</li> <li>Featured Multiplayer modes’ Safety Ratings have been revised, increasing the number of races taken into account from 10 to 20; also improved the matchmaking algorithm to search for a narrower range of Safety Ratings in the player pool</li> <li>Several vehicle racing category revisions, with plenty more to come (such as a recategorization of Forza GT vehicles into dedicated spec divisions, slated for Summer)</li> <li>Improved the Drivatar AI’s propensity for unnecessary braking in situations of attempted passovers, wide turns, corner apex encounters, and straight racing scenarios.</li> <li>Introduced the Mobil 1 partnership with an appropriate Maple Valley race track update.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">For a more comprehensive list, be sure to check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2440510/view/4191239670803852876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10’s Steam blog post</a>, but that should give you an idea of what to expect. The Mobil 1 partnership is interesting, too, though the value of this partnership will hinge mainly on the upcoming Rival events, which Turn 10 is yet to explain in greater detail.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">As for the new vehicles and events, here’s the full list of Featured Tour events running through late June:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"> <li>May 15 – June 26: Ginetta Juniors (Spotlight: Ginetta G40 Junior)</li> <li>May 22 – June 26: Weekend Warriors (Spotlight: 2015 Porsche Cayman GTS)</li> <li>May 29 – June 26: Kit Caterhams (Spotlight: Caterham Superlight R500)</li> <li>June 5 – June 26: Track Toys (Spotlight: Elemental RP1)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Completing all four of these series will not only allow you to nab their respective Spotlight cars at a low price, but also the delightful 2019 Porsche Motorsport 935 #70. As for the latest Open Class Tour refresh, the final reward there is the BMW M1 Coupe from 2011. Not a bad offering, but a fair bit less exciting than the 935.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">While all of the fixes, tweaks, and improvements outlined above are already available in <em>Forza Motorsport</em> as of May 13, the seasonal batch of Update 8 content won’t be going live until May 15. From that point onwards, you’ve got about a month’s worth of time to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-two-types-of-fomo-present-in-forza-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock all of the FOMO-bound rewards</a> until Update 9 comes out, such as the aforementioned Motorsport 935. </p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that it’s officially become <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fastest-selling PlayStation game <em>ever</em></a>, it should come as no surprise that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is bound to stay in the limelight for a good long while. Yet, the game has been going through a rough patch lately, and one developer stands out as someone keeping those conversations helpful and honest.</p> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Specifically, one of the Arrowhead Games’ community managers, Thomas Petersson (aka Twinbeard), has responded to a number of community questions over on the official Discord. In the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, Petersson is widely praised and often brought up as the golden standard for communication, which has been a stellar source of goodwill for Arrowhead. Judging by Petersson’s responses, his popularity is bound to grow further still, and his methods have sparked a new round of productive conversation and criticism over on the <em>Helldivers </em>subreddit.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-things-might-be-looking-up-for-helldivers-2-s-item-and-weapon-balance" data-injectable="false">Things might be looking up for Helldivers 2’s item and weapon balance</h2> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">Redditor povbear20 assembled a comprehensive list of Thomas Petersson’s comments and responses on Discord, rounding up everything that’s been said for Reddit. Overall, the vibe is quite positive, and folks seem to really appreciate Petersson in particular, which is good to see. </p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">The community manager has touched on a lot of community concerns, so to recap for everyone, some of those Helldivers 2 Discord conversations include topics like: </p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Helldivers 2</em> Warbond cadence being internally discussed</li> <li>The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-mock-the-games-fragile-mechs-and-manufacturer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papier-mache mechs</a> being review</li> <li>A <em>Helldivers 2</em> test server is a possibility</li> <li>Arrowhead <em>might</em> be aware of punishing enemy spawn rates for smaller squads and solo operatives</li> <li>More player polls are coming</li> <li>Arrowhead wants to improve game balance at large, allowing each weapon to shine in a niche</li> <li>Many Arrowhead developers effectively “lost” a week to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PlayStation Network issues</a>, and had to leave in-game considerations aside to resolve it.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">This shortlist is very truncated, of course, and I recommend reading up on Petersson’s responses properly, as posted by povbear20, if at all possible. Broadly, though, the information on offer here is well-thought-out and meaningful, and if Arrowhead manages to get back its mojo, the game should be back on track to greatness in relatively short order.</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The idea that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-helldivers-2-pushing-forward-far-too-quickly-for-its-own-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is having trouble keeping up with its own success</a> isn’t new, of course. The fact that Premium Warbonds are coming out on a monthly basis, in particular, hasn’t sat well with the community due to the state of the new weapon releases and some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-eruptor-nerf-was-deliberate-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable approaches to item balancing</a>, and some feel that Arrowhead should slow things down until they get everything sorted out in full.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="false">It’s going to be interesting to see what comes of <em>Helldivers 2</em> next. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even the Arrowhead CEO feels that the game’s balancing has gone off the deep end</a> over the last couple of weeks, which should suggest some big changes in the near future. With no firm confirmation as to whether that’ll happen or not, though, Helldivers can only wait and see what Super-Earth has in store for them next.</p>
