			<p>For those who are fans of the life simulation genre that is predominantly conquered by The Sims, there is a new competitor on the block that is released in Early Access today. inZOI is now available in Early Access and has already reached the top spot on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Steam Top Sellers</a> just 40 minutes after it was released. If you want to see what it's all about, make sure to check out the Early Access launch video for inZOI below.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, inZOI was ranked first on Steam's Global Top Wishlists while people were actively waiting for the game to release in Early Access today. There has been a large buzz surrounding the game, as content creators globally have created various videos and written content about the title, showcasing what they can expect from this game. Currently, inZOI is available on Steam for $39.99, with all updates and DLC provided for free until the game's full release.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the Early Access launch, then inZOI demo was also available to players across the globe, which gave them the opportunity to try out inZOI's Character Studio and Build Studio. However, now that the game is officially in Early Access, the demo has been closed down and is no longer available.</p>
<p>inZOI was also incredibly popular on Twitch, where it reached the fifth spot in the Games category on Twitch as of March 27, and is likely to see it spike again with the full release and many able to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>Thus far, inZOI has been well received, with a Very Positive rating on Steam and over 3600 reviews at the time of writing.</p>
<p>"I created and nurtured inZOI with great care as if it were my child, though it still has a lot of room for improvement. As inZOI takes its first steps into the world, I feel both proud and somewhat anxious - hoping it won't stumble or get hurt," says inZOI Studio CEO, Producer, and Director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim. "It would be deeply appreciated if you could watch over the game with warmth and support. As we prepare for inZOI's official launch, we will continue to genuinely engage with creators across the globe to make it better, one step at a time."</p>
<p>inZOI has over 250 customization options and 400 mental elements, with a wide creative suite that is powered by on-device generative AI. The title has been produced utilizing Unreal Engine 5, and requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">relatively beefy specifications</a> to be able to run it.</p>

No, it was nothing quite as colossal as <em>God of War </em>or <em>The Last of Us </em>coming to the handheld console, but a remaster of the first two <em>Patapons </em>and the next game in the <em>Everybody’s Golf </em>series will be available on Switch. Both are coming to the system through a partnership with Bandai Namco, which also recently brought the cult Vita RPG <em>Freedom Wars</em> to the system earlier this year, but Sony also brought <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a></span><em> </em>to the system on its own in 2024. At the moment, Sony only seems to be putting “smaller” titles on Nintendo’s platform, but if PlayStation is open to sharing more of its catalog with Switch owners, I can think of a few more that would fit right in.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Ape Escape </em>series got a bit of a spotlight again last year as one of the games featured in <em>Astro Bot</em>. PlayStation fans still have a soft spot for the long-dormant platformers, and their simple loop of chasing and catching apes is much better suited to a handheld like the Switch than a big-box console these days. If Sony were looking to test the waters for bringing the series back, putting something on the Switch, which has a much larger audience of young players than other platforms do, seems like a solid business plan. </p></div><div><p>It’s easy to forget that <em>Gravity Rush </em>started out as a handheld game, but the original open-world action game was a Vita exclusive for three years until Sony remastered it for the PS4 in 2015. <em>Gravity Rush </em>and its sequel are two deeply underappreciated gems in Sony’s catalog that deserved better than they got. The gravity-bending mechanics are an incredibly clever way to handle open-world traversal, letting you “fall” from one side of the map to the other rather than just using straightforward flight. It requires you to pay attention to physics in the environment, and you also use it to collide with your foes. It’s such an interesting spin on how we move through video game worlds that it’s a shame more people haven’t played it. Just port ‘em to Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Sony seems ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727">abandon its platformer/level creation suite</a></span>, so I don’t have much hope that <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>will make an appearance on PlayStation consoles again, much less on Switch. But the entire premise of this list is pie-in-the-sky requests. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>’s platforming is floaty, frustrating and doesn’t hold a candle to better games like the <em>Mario </em>series that are readily available on Switch. However, its level creation tools are still some of the best on the market. <em>LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</em> already demonstrated that the series is well-suited to handhelds, so a Switch version seems like a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p>I wouldn’t have thought there was any hope of <em>LocoRoco</em> making a comeback in 2025, but after seeing <em>Patapon </em>remasters announced for Switch, I can dare to dream. The PlayStation Portable series was built to be on a handheld. As you tilted the world with the shoulder buttons, it felt like you were controlling a world inside the device’s tiny screen. Sure, the same control scheme applies to the PS4 version on your TV, but it still feels most natural on a handheld. If we’re bringing bite-sized cult classics like <em>Patapon </em>to Switch, <em>LocoRoco </em>should be in the running as well.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Medievil </em>series deserves a new entry on PlayStation 5, but I will settle for seeing the existing games brought to the Switch. To this day, there’s no simple way to play <em>Medievil 2 </em>unless you’ve got a spare PlayStation lying around, though the original spooky hack-and-slash game was remade for the PS4 in 2019. Sir Daniel Fortesque’s Tim Burton-esque adventures have gotten more chances than most of Sony’s original PlayStation gems to re-enter the public consciousness after being remade for both the PlayStation Portable and PS4, but I simply don’t think twice is enough. The third time’s the charm. Put our haggard hero on Nintendo’s handheld, Sony.</p></div><div><p>I simply don’t think there is an excuse for <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>not to be on every platform imaginable. The PS1 and 2 rhythm games are hardly demanding for any modern device to run and the original has already been remastered for the PS4. A new generation of players needs to hear Chop Chop Master Onion teach karate by way of hip-hop. Why deny the millions of Switch owners the experience of rapping their way through their driver’s test or rap-battling their teachers in the line for the bathroom? Now I’m pulling up YouTube videos of all these songs, and they’re all bangers. Like <em>Medievil</em>, it’s time <em>Parappa </em>got a new game, but in the meantime, put these tracks on Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Alright, here’s the real reason I made this list. I’m here to put <em>Sly Cooper </em>propaganda on your screen. Fans are still holding out hope that Sony will one day greenlight a fifth game in the heist platformer series that will resolve the cliffhanger ending of <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>, but in the years since, the Vita has still been my go-to place to play Sucker Punch’s PS2 trilogy, and I gotta blow an inch of dust off that thing if I ever want to see the Cooper Gang. That could all be changed if Sony would put the games on the Switch. I still think the <em>Sly Cooper </em>games are some of the most timeless games in PlayStation’s long history, which makes it a real shame that Sucker Punch and Sony stopped investing in them during the PS3 era. Yeah, <em>Thieves in Time </em>was a passion project from Sanzaru Games that was divisive but nailed the smooth and simple stealth mechanics that made them so successful back in the day. Sony, if you ignore everything else I have said here, don’t ignore this. Put <em>Sly Cooper </em>on the Switch. And PC. And hell, put it on Xbox while you’re at it. Have you considered a mobile port? </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Physical preorders of the Nintendo Switch version are available at Amazon and Best Buy. Digital preorders are also live on the Switch eShop and Steam. </p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17431743169334?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17431743169334?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17431743169334?u1=subid_value">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Premium Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17431743169334?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17431743169334?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/bibikng9du4mo?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17431743169334?u1=subid_value">$70 | Releases August 27</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Upgrade to the Premium Edition to get a bunch of physical collectibles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-looney-tunes-warner-bros-zaslav<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite the best efforts of Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/original-looney-tunes-removed-max-warner-bros-1236327964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">erase the legacy of the <em>Looney Tunes</em></a> entirely, there is a fully animated Looney Tunes movie in theaters, and it's fantastic. Chris Person and Gita Jackson sat down to talk about all the reasons you need to see this movie right now.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Last week I saw <em>The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie</em> with my good friend and laughed harder than I have at any movie in recent memory. It is, shockingly, the first fully animated, theatrically released original movie in the Loony Tunes franchise. Though Loony Tunes has been good recently, I was simply not prepared for how good this movie is. Gita, you also saw it, what's up doc?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> My good friend Chris—what a movie. I saw it with my perfect husband David and I was absolutely overjoyed. There were a lot of kids in the theater with us, which made me so happy. Given the controversy surrounding the way that Warner Bros. has maintained this brand (read: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/warner-bros-tearing-down-looney-tunes-building-131-1236352601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they are trying to destroy it</a>), I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;sure if kids cared about the Looney Tunes at all. But on my way out, I heard a kid tell his dad that this was the most amazing movie&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;ever seen.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Honestly they were not wrong.</p><p>This movie was originally meant to be dumped on streaming and I'm glad it wasn't, because seeing it with an audience was a borderline religious experience. The movie shockingly threads that needle between being just edgy and a little abrasive without ever crossing the line to inappropriate. This is the soul of Looney Tunes, but also it reminded me a lot of what was good about 90s-2000s American cartoons, when we just let freaks put whatever out there.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Let's Get Looney! | The Day The Earth Blew Up | TRAILER | @wbkids​" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtHUWHXfDyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> All of the kids were laughing so hard during my screening—I was too. What I really appreciated was at that no point was the movie trying to teach a lesson. This was not a didactic movie about the nature of generational trauma.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;sole goal was to make the audience laugh, and it had a <em>Simpsons</em>-esque desire to cram as many jokes into each scene as humanly possible.</p><p>A lot of children’s entertainment is actually for adults nowadays. This was a very funny movie definitely for kids.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, it's not didactic or moral art. It's a cartoon duck with a mallet and a pig with a speech impediment.&nbsp; It is focused on "the bits" which and there's one that made me ugly laugh out loud way too much once every minute or too. I do not need to go to Loony Tunes for a moral, I go to watch a joke so silly a child can understand it, but crafted so well an adult can appreciate it.</p><p>To the extent that these things need a setup, we should talk about the premise before continuing.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yes!!!! This is simply a movie about Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, two anthropomorphic animals that grew up with their adoptive father, Farmer Jim. After Farmer Jim…. Dies? Becomes God? They are left to take care of the house, which they do a poor job of because Daffy is&nbsp;well, daffy, and Porky is too shy. After a mysterious meteor hits their roof&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;left to find a job to fix it, or else&nbsp;they’ll&nbsp;be kicked out of their ancestral home. In the process they meet Petunia Pig, a flavor scientist at the gum factory, and start to get wrapped up in an alien invasion.</p><p>I gotta say—Petunia Pig, flavor scientist was a great bit. Just a huge weirdo chewing on sponges.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Porky finally has a girlfriend and she's a freak. It rocks.</p><p>That entire sequence of them being raised together rocks partially because they choose to do very limited animation for Farmer Jim, he's painted like he's the background. He basically talks like animated Clutch Cargo, just his mouth is animated but his body is painted like the scenery. At one point there's a shot of him walking that's just the character's body totally rigid moving up and down. And then they have one closeup that looks like it is animated on the 1's, just an overly fluid shot of him looking at them. It's a joke entirely about the form of animation and it is simultaneously both incredibly high effort and also very silly, and that's like the entire movie.</p><p>This movie is also very clearly modeled after Bob Clampett, and I know his daughter Ruth Clampett has a cameo as a waitress.</p><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVjOgFI6YrY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Day The Earth Blew Up</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Oh my god&nbsp;I didn’t&nbsp;know that!</p><p>That’s&nbsp;so cool.</p><p>The whole movie is above letter to specifically the American traditions of animation. They change styles several times within the movie, and make a lot of homages to classic Looney Tunes style bits. The montage of them getting jobs and then getting fired from them is framed as a show within a show Looney Tunes episode.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The beginning has a Fleischer Superman quality to it that's very clearly intentional.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A big portion of the plot is about how Daffy and Porky are kinda fuckups, like their weird relationship as brothers. Porky is the relatively sensible one and Daffy is constantly fucking things up or sabotaging things because he's a cartoon.</p><p>Including Porky's new relationship with his girlfriend. They get a new job but then the middle act of the plot is an Invasion Of The Body Snatchers/The Faculty bit where the aliens are taking over the minds of everyone with gum. They even do the Donald Sutherland pointing shot.</p><p>Gita: This is what I mean about it being <em>Simpsons</em>-esque. There's this one scene that my husband loves to use to demonstrate just how packed full of jokes each scene in the Simpsons is:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bart vs the Street Sweeper" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdz4bc2LGMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Literally every four seconds in this movie, they are trying to keep the energy up in the same way. Each frame has a joke that will land for somebody, hopefully everyone.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> This movie has 11 writers and honestly it works, you need that many for this kind of joke density. I didn't realize Johnny Ryan worked on this!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> What! Oh my god.</p><p>Just an embarrassment of riches on this movie.</p><p>Seeing this movie gave me a level of hope for the future of animation that is matched in intensity by the despair I feel looking at <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stupid AI art that people keep making</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I was not expecting to leave the theater feeling a sense of optimism, particularly given the state of animation generally and the abuse this franchise has suffered by David Zaslav specifically, but there is so much love in every single frame and it was just so affirming to see something that willful on the big screen.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Did you have any favorite jokes? For me, the ten second bit where Daffy attempts to become an influencer and gets canceled had me howling.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> There's a series of gags back to back that involve everyone reacting to Daffy being the deciding factor. Second place is this montage of Porky falling for Petunia after she comes in from the rain and it cuts back and forth between what he thinks she looks like and what she actually looks like and it's edited and animated perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best jokes are just line reads and tiny details in the background. It's just a constant barrage I can't keep them straight. Man, I should see this movie again.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I want to see it a million times. I was so happy that I was in the theater for the gag of someone leaving the theater--I have never actually seen a joke of that type in an actual movie theater and it was just perfect.</p><p>You know what I mean—a silhouette of a man stood up on the screen and muttered "Who greenlit this?"</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh yeah that's the bit I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> If this movie is screening near you, RUN do not walk to theaters. This is a kind of animated movie we really do not see a lot of anymore, and it's a gem, a special production, and apparently word of mouth is the only thing keeping it in theaters.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I agree: Do not wait. If you haven't seen it already, go out to a theater to see it if you have the means and are able to. Don't wait for it on streaming unless you have to, see it with a group of people from all ages. Laugh your ass off with Daffy and Porky.</p><p>Show them that cartoons like this are not only viable, they're vital.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-us-retailer-documents-shed-light-on-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans.1148157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Retailers are expecting that they will run out of pre-order units for the Nintendo Switch 2 on day 1, despite Nintendo allegedly accumulating a large quantity for launch.</p>



<p>That’s according to internal emails and documents provided to Insider Gaming from a large US retailer, who are anticipating they will sell out of the Switch 2 on the same day they open up the pre-orders due to a limited unit allocation from Nintendo.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 is scheduled to release in June</a>, a release month that has already been a widely rumoured and was a highly talked about by developers at this year’s GDC.</p>



<p>However, the documents do add a little confusion as to when the pre-orders go live, especially following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Buy Canada “leak” </a>earlier this week that revealed they’d go live on April 2nd.</p>



<p>According to the documents from the US retailer, pre-orders are set to go live on April 9th, one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents include a messaging strategy following the direct to include “Pre-Order Coming Soon” messaging and a Countdown Clock that will end on April 9, with an exact time to be confirmed by Nintendo on April 2.</p>



<p>The documents also included details on a exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>



<p>Whether or not Best Buy Canada’s “leak” was a mistake or not is unclear, but the company did promptly remove the information after it started circulating online. In any case though, pre-order’s are almost certainly going to live within a week of the direct.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Like it was carrying the weight of the world.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nier-automata">NieR:Automata</a> brought a lot of attention to the series and its creators, but it may have also had some greater ramifications for the industry. In a new interview, former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he thinks NieR: Automata "revived" the Japanese game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (as translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1905573888693764488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said the Japanese games industry was struggling after chasing overseas trends in the PlayStation 3 era. He said he thought director Yoko Taro made NieR: Automata without thinking whether or not it would sell overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From there, it became clear that Japanese creators were making 'Japanese things' and those things were selling overseas," Yoshida said. "Everyone realized that with NieR."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was just a matter of saying 'it's okay to do it like that,' but 'we have to do it like that,'" Yoshida continued. "So the direction of Japanese creators became 'let's stop imitating overseas countries anymore,' 'if we create things with our own culture and that we understand, they will understand it overseas.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the Japanese game industry was revived after NieR so much so that I would say it was before NieR and after NieR," Yoshida said. "To put it simply, I think NieR: Automata was the title that made people realize 'let's make something Japanese.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NieR: Automata has been, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-series-director-producer-and-composer-start-new-project-it-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">by all accounts</a>, a success for publisher Square Enix and the creative team behind the game, including Yoko Taro. It's spawned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/nier-automata-ver11a">an anime adaptation</a> and a flurry of cameos for popular protagonist 2B, in everything from Fall Guys to Soulcalibur.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The future of the series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sounds-like-well-eventually-get-a-nier-sequel-but-dont-hold-your-breath">seems a bit unclear</a>, as of this writing. While the mobile game NieR: Reincarnation <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">may well have been the NieR 3 fans were waiting for</a>, it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">also shut down last April</a>. The creative team has worked on a handful of other projects too, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-card-rpg-voice-of-cards-switch-october">card-driven RPG Voice of Cards</a>, but NieR fans are still waiting for the next premium game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Yoshida saw a shifting of the tides with NieR: Automata. Given how popular the game is today, I'm inclined to agree. Hopefully we see more from NieR soon, but now, as we're roughly eight years removed from its original 2017 launch date, it's a nice recognition of Automata's already-tangible legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among the news is confirmation that its launch roster might be a little smaller than you'd expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In several Q&amp;As following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_juWbTw4hc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent video update</a>, both with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2416952692" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fighting game content creator Sajam</a> and in the 2XKO Discord (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>), Riot confirmed there will be 10 playable champions — characters — at launch. According to game director Shaun Rivera, it sounds like the lower number could help get 2XKO in players' hands faster.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know it seems like a low number. I know. Trust me, y'know, we hear it," Rivera said in Sajam's stream. "Honestly, we'd rather just get the game out to y'all to play ASAP, instead of keeping it in the oven until we have some number higher of champions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivera went on to note that, with systems like the different Fuses and Solo/Duo play, there are "a lot of ways" to play the characters on the roster. Plus, this won't be a static game post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of that too, we're a live service game," Rivera said. "So [the] champion train is gonna start once we're out the door and in your guys' hands, so we're gonna start releasing those champions. We'd rather get it to you and do that, instead of just hold it for longer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As executive producer Tom Cannon pointed out on the stream, these characters have also seen some changes throughout development. He referenced Jinx, who just got a gameplay showcase in yesterday's video update: "Go back to the very first announce trailer, which had Jinx in it, and you can see how much effort our creative department and the whole team has put into continuing to make the game as good as it can be. And then when it gets to that point, that's when we'll release it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's a notably smaller launch roster than most fighting games. For reference, Street Fighter 6 launched with 18 characters, and fellow tag fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ arrived with 24 at launch. On the smaller side, Granblue Fantasy Versus' original launch had 11 characters, and the arcade version of Guilty Gear Xrd had 13.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">League of Legends 2XKO launch roster of playable characters confirmed so far:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ahri</li><li>Ekko</li><li>Yasuo</li><li>Darius</li><li>Illaoi</li><li>Braum</li><li>Jinx</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Katarina was also seen in some footage at one point, but has <a href="https://x.com/2XKOintel/status/1814798398828257793" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been cut from the launch roster</a>. So there are three champions left to reveal before launch, from League of Legends' titanic <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_champions" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">170 champion</a> lineup (as of January 2025).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a surprisingly low number, 2XKO has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riots-2xko-is-the-tag-fighter-i-didnt-know-i-wanted">also impressed many players</a> in its public showings. A <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-alpha-lab-overview--faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Alpha Lab preview</a> is planned for April 18 through 20 for the United States, Canada, and Brazil, but no official launch date has been set yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Back in February during Sony’s State of Play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">MindsEye was revealed</a>, with the game being in development by Build A Rocket Boy and published by IOI Partners. Today, more exciting news has surfaced as the release date for MindsEye has been confirmed and you will not have to wait long. On June 10th, MindsEye will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S with pre-orders being available right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<em>thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences</em><br>
<em>unravel.”</em> said Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye.</p>

Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his past.</p>


<p>MindsEye has been given a price of $59,99 /€59.99/£54,99, and those who pre-order will get a free upgrade to the deluxe edition. This is available for both digital and physical pre-orders. The MindsEye Deluxe Edition includes “Premium Pass”, the Deluxe Thorn &amp; Kepler Yellowjacket Weapon, Future Jacob Vest Skin, “Future” Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin, and the Future DC2 Companion Drone Skin.</p>

            <p>We last wrote about immersive sim sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 3 back in 2020, when then-developers Otherside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-take-over-system-shock-3">sold the franchise to megapublisher Tencent</a>. Development of the series later passed to remaster specialists Nightdive Studios, who’ve already overhauled the first game and are currently working on a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> for release in June.</p>
<p>Now, Nightdive have popped up with news that the System Shock 3 project survives, in some form, and that we could get clarification as to its status “potentially within a year”. Don’t call it a comeback, do call it a sign of life.</p><!--more-->
<p>“The situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated,” Nightdive’s director of business development Larry Kuperman hedged at GDC this week, in comments published by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">VGC</a>. </p>
<p>Can we expect a proper update anytime soon? “Not as yet, not as yet,” Kuperman went on. “I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year. It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see a remaster of System Shock 2,” he added. “I’ve been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake, and I said, ‘are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won’t be able to do a remake in the future?’ That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there’s going to be content coming out.”</p>
<p>So there’s your bonus headline here: Nightdive might do a System Shock 2 remake after the remaster. Asked about the future of the series beyond retreads of the existing games, Kuperman said: “We’ll see what happens. I mean, there’s stuff that we can do within the first and the second.” Some expansions then?</p>
<p>It’s all very… non-enlightening. But I’m happy with any sign that System Shock has a future beyond replaying the hits, and Nightdive seem like they could hack a threequel. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of their System Shock remake</a>, Jeremy Peel called it “a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake that proves the enduring power of Looking Glass design.”</p>
<p>Jeremy’s also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-system-shock-2-made-stephen-kick-and-nightdive-studios">an interview with Nightdive</a> detailing how the studio got their hands on the license, beginning with a phone chat with an insurance company and ending with Nightdive’s acquisition by Atari.</p>
<p>As for Otherside – the studio co-founded by original System Shock devs Paul Neurath and Warren Spector - they’re currently working on a new immersive sim, Thick As Thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer Pearl Abyss has announced that it is ending support for Black Desert Online on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.console.playblackdesert.com/News/Notice/Detail?boardNo=19140&amp;countryType=en-US&amp;boardType=0&amp;searchType=&amp;searchText=%C2%A4tPage=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video going over</a> the plans, the studio revealed that the game’s native update for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will launch on June 26, 2025. At that point, the game will “shift to an exclusive PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S service”. This will result in support for the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4—both of which received the game in 2019—officially coming to an end.</p>



<p>“Gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available after the porting update on June 26,” said Brian Choi, Black Desert console’s live service manager.</p>



<p>He continued to assure players that all game data will be saved and stored. Account information as well as all entitlements to Black Desert Online will be accessible when players decide to make the jump to the current-gen console version of the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you,” Choi said. “Black Desert has been consistently updated to provide a better experience for adventurers. However, as we mentioned in our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly.”</p>



<p>When the update is released, it will be available at no additional cost for players who are making the jump to the current-gen systems.</p>

We’re also introduced to Shiva Vega, Redrock’s power-hungry Mayor, whose blind ambition is to make Redrock the safest city in the world and to gain even greater control of its citizens. </p><p>The volatile relationship between Silva and Vega—Big Tech and Government—is poised to impact the future of Redrock and its inhabitants, but mostly Jacob Diaz, MindsEye’s protagonist, as he searches for answers about his troubled past.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

that 23% of the cheaters were removed before they played their first match.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new changes is the updated UI for Season 3. Activision says that a large portion of player-reported incidents are inaccurate and often console players. The report suggests that some of the inaccuracy might come from kills by players who used in-game intel like a Recon Scout perk or live ping. So, Season 3 will give players more detail on the KillCams to allow them to see if their opponent was using various game elements at the time of the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Details in the KillCam widget will include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">List of attackers who dealt damage with their username, weapon, damage, and hits</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by Live Ping: If the enemy had you pinged via line-of-sight</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by UAV: If the enemy had you pinged on the minimap via UAV, UAV Tower, or</li><li dir="ltr">Advanced UAV</li><li dir="ltr">Affected by unsuppressed weapon: When firing your weapon revealed your location on</li><li dir="ltr">the minimap to nearby enemies</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Season 3 will work to further improve the Ranked Play experience, which has previously been a hotspot for cheaters. The team will introduce a new system shortly after the launch of Season 3 that will help counter the impact a banned cheater had on the Ranked Play system with retroactive SR adjustments.</p><p dir="ltr">These actions include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">When a Ranked Play cheater is banned, anyone they've recently defeated in Ranked Play will receive a SR Refund for those matches (to start, we will examine the last two weeks of matches but will continue to monitor if this timing needs to be adjusted)</li><li dir="ltr">Players who we detect playing with cheaters may have SR for those wins taken away</li></ul><p dir="ltr">A leaderboard scrub will also be performed before the end of Season 2 to remove any cheaters who gained SR illegitimately.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467268"></a><figcaption>Verdansk returns with improved graphics and lighting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4467268-bo6-wz-season-03-returntoverdansk-002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Season 3 is bringing updates to the team's aimbot detections and the machine-learning system that analyzes game replays to identify suspicious gameplay for manual enforcement.</p><p dir="ltr">Changes are also coming to the account linking process in Season 3. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also warned players against actions that could get them in trouble. This includes intentionally "teaming" to work with other squads to either grief other teams or account boost, as this is against the Call of Duty Code of Conduct and Security and Enforcement Policy. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-issues-an-extreme-warning-to-cheaters/1100-6530183/">warned players about account buying and selling</a>, as any account that has been knowingly sold will be permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, players can expect several new layers to Call of Duty's anti-cheat efforts with Season 3, but to avoid giving away all the details too early, Activision says it will release an updated report on these new anti-cheat efforts closer to the Season 3 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher has recently hyped up the return of Warzone's Verdansk map, such as releasing an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-og-map-verdansk-returns-very-soon-see-a-new-trailer-now/1100-6529994/">OG Verdansk trailer</a> and bringing back nostalgic weapons and operators. Hopefully, these new anti-cheat efforts will be enough to hold the cheaters back and not ruin all the nostalgic fun.</p><p dir="ltr">For more news, make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-season-3-adds-iconic-mp-map-new-zombies-plus-jay-and-silent-bob/2900-6380/#1">highlights for Season 3 of Black Ops 6</a>, which showcase the new Shattered Veil Zombies map, several multiplayer maps, and Jay and Silent Bob operator bundles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-season-3-roadmap-highlights-verdansk-event-omnimovement-changes-and-bots/2900-6375/">Warzone's Season 3 content is showcased here</a>, including the classic features and vehicles returning with Verdansk.</p>

                <p>What happens when you die in InZoi? It's a question that was somewhat explained by Krafton prior to the release of its life sim game. While there are up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-death-including-shocking-and-unexpected-ones/1100-6530241/" data-ref-id="1100-6530241">16 ways to die in InZoi</a>, there are a limited number of options for what comes after death, including becoming a ghost and navigating the afterlife. Before you make your decision on whether to contend with the afterlife or simply reload an earlier save, we've got all you need to know on how it works.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#The_afterlife">The afterlife</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</a><ul><li><a href="#Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="The_afterlife">The afterlife</h2><p>When your Zoi dies, you'll be given the option to go on to the afterlife or reload an earlier save. The latter is self-explanatory, but what exactly is the afterlife?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467133"></a><figcaption>The death tooltip</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467133-died.jpg"></figure><p>Depending on your Zoi's Karma score at the time of death, you may be able to pass on peacefully, or you may be forced to roam the city as a ghost until your Karma score improves. While Krafton hasn't fully implemented the ghost system at the early access release date, we do know how it works thanks to the in-game tooltips that appear.</p><p>If you've been living a life of crime, maybe you decided to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM</a> or two, maybe you interacted negatively with other Zois, or maybe you've been forced to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">get out of jail</a> more than once, then your Karma score won't be good. If this is the case, when you turn into a ghost you'll need to commit good deeds to raise your Karma score to "good" in order to peacefully pass on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467136"></a><figcaption>Nyx the cat will guide you through the afterlife.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467136-ghost.jpg"></figure><p>If there are too many ghosts in your city, you will find that it's difficult to create other Zois to move in. Other citizens will also be creeped out because, well, you're a ghost. While the ghost system isn't yet active in-game, it's unclear which good deeds will raise your Karma as a ghost. We're hoping there will be actions exclusive to ghosts, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Ghosts are due to be added to the game around August 2025.</p><p>You'll also be given the option to go back in time. This way, you can save your Zoi from death before it's too late.</p><h2 id="How_to_die_in_InZoi">How to die in InZoi</h2><p>In our case, we were deliberately trying to murder our Zoi by starving him to death, just to see how this system works. It took three full in-game days of no food and approximately six "12 hours left" warnings before he finally passed away, so if your Zoi does die, it seems like you'll have gone well out of your way to make it happen depending on the manner of their dying. It's difficult to kill off a Zoi, at least through starvation or exhaustion, though it's a bit easier to be electrocuted while you try to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">rob an ATM in InZoi</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467138"></a><figcaption>You'll be warned before your Zoi dies.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4467138-starvation.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Types_of_InZoi_death">Types of InZoi death</h3><p>While the developer says there are plentiful ways to die, including car accidents, even when running headfirst into traffic we didn't suffer so much as a scratch. Here are all of the ways we've discovered to die in InZoi so far:</p><ul><li>Starvation - Not eating for an extended period of time</li><li>Exhaustion - Not sleeping for an extended period of time</li><li>Pollution - Repeated exposure to high levels of pollution for a long time</li><li>Disease - If a Zoi gets a disease and remains untreated</li><li>Car Accident - When in a vehicle and experiencing a high-speed collision with another car</li><li>Loneliness - No social interaction or recognition</li><li>Slipping - Wet surfaces are a hazard</li><li>Electric Shock - Breaking into an ATM or repairing broken electronics can result in electrocution</li><li>Burning - Sims fans will be familiar with their characters dying in a fire</li><li>Embarrassment - While we haven't seen this ourselves yet, Krafton has mentioned Zois can actually die of embarrassment.</li><li>Old Age - The natural way</li></ul><p>Krafton has stated it will not add murder to the game, as it doesn't agree with it. However, it has said that if one Zoi accidentally starts a fire, and another Zoi is near that fire, they're likely to pass away. Make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game was originally revealed as part of the Everywhere project from Benzies' studio Build A Rocket Boy; then in October last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">Hitman developer IO Interactive announced it would be publishing MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Now it has a firm release date: 10th June 2025, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. And there's a new story trailer to go with it too.</p>

<p>The trailer for the action-adventure thriller introduces the near-future desert metropolis of Redrock City, as well as the eccentric tech boss Marco Silva eager to change the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>"We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel," said Benzies.</p>
<p>Adam Whiting, assistant game director at Build A Rocket Boy, told Eurogamer the team isn't worried about a June release clashing with the traditional E3 and Summer Game Fest period. "It maybe allows us to actually talk to players, engage with players around that time in a meaningful way," he said. "We're just very excited for players to finally get the chance to play."</p>
<p>Further, Whiting confirmed that the developer is still working on Everywhere. "MindsEye is a standalone game, but it is kind of connected," he said. "You can access it through Everywhere as a platform, but mostly we're really focused on MindsEye."</p>
<p>Everywhere was first revealed at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in 2022, though its purpose confused players and rumours swirled around cryptocurrency and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>. Benzies flatly denied this to Eurogamer during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">preview of the project in March 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It is, essentially, a platform for user-generated content, akin to Roblox, with MindsEye as a primary example from the developer itself of what can be achieved. More recently, MindsEye has taken centre stage with Everywhere humming away in the background.</p>
<p>MindsEye will be available as a standalone game for £54.99 / $59,99 / €59.99.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">company was hit by layoffs in early 2024</a>, a month after completing a fresh $110m funding round from investor NetEase.</p>
<p>Whiting noted to Eurogamer the industry's rapid expansion during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was followed by global layoffs. "We're seeing a lot of that stuff happening in the industry right now and it makes me sad because the games industry is full of so many very talented, very lovely people," he said. "But it's this period of the ebbs and flows, the peaks and troughs, and maybe it's in a bit of a trough now, but I'm sure it'll peak again soon."</p>
<p>He also noted that NetEase's recent, apparent pullback from video games hasn't affected the studio negatively. "Certainly, there's nothing that's let us to make any compromises or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>"You know Leslie, he's a visionary, and he doesn't want to compromise on that vision for anything at all."</p>

I think the idea of a chill, cosy, and/or “Zen” factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> is among the most pernicious to ever dribble from a game developer’s earhole, but I can’t deny how... soothing it can be to look down on a world of symmetrically nested conveyor belts. At least till your iron smelting district backs up. Modulus seems zouper-douper Zen. It also has a pleasing consistency: in this factory game, you shape and manufacture pieces for buildings which, as far as I can tell from the devlog below, can then be used to manufacture pieces for other buildings.

These building parts aren’t generic, liquid resources that magically add up into an airport or similar, once you’ve met the requirements. You can trace them within the architecture of the resulting construction. Rather than growing them from a given recipe, you’ll also sculpt these building parts from clumps of smaller cubes. You can venture inside each production facility to rotate, colour, stamp and trim these cubes to satisfaction, a mechanic that reminds me distantly of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries of Titan</a>, but without the accumulating e-waste.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is quite nice. It helps that the world you’re building factories in is a blend of pearly iPod paving stones and verdant plastic greenery. Very calming. Nicely... lacking in things besides factories.
</p>
<p>
“There are no timers, no enemies—just you and your factory,” adds the Steam page. “Relax and find your flow as you build at your own pace. Watch your factory expand, with monumental buildings emerging to meet the ever growing demand from The Grand Neural Network.” That last part sounds a little ominous. Still, I’m sure “ever growing demand” won’t cause any difficulties as long as the resources available to me are also “ever growing”. Incidentally, are there any animals in this world? Any people? Ah, no matter.
</p>
<p>
There’s a demo for Modulus in the works for 3rd April. It will encompass an estimated two hours of playtime, though it’s fundamentally “only limited in factory floor size.” It’ll also have an objective-free "Zen" mode and a tutorial. I guess I could have waited till the demo launch to write this up, but it’s a slow news day – it was either this or write about some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> nonsense. Besides, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779120/Modulus/">you can sign up for the Modulus playtest right now on Steam</a>.
