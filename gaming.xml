            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes did a <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-double-devstream-confirmed-warframe-1999-soulframe-pre-alpha/">devstream</a> that revealed some of the features that players can look forward to in Soulframe Preludes (Pre-Alpha) in December. The features contain companion summoning, a social hub for players, environmental hazard mechanics and more. For those interested in the full devstream, you can watch it below, where they go into detail about the features that you can expect in December. If you don't want to watch the whole thing, there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXOinkXxJrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small teaser trailer</a> that showcases some of the features you can expect, such as a new Omen Beast and a rideable wolf mount.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe Devstream #3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvLYxzGtfNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Diving into the devstream content, they've mentioned some of the updates that will be available in December, which provides a new level of difficulty to the game, as well as some familiar content being added which was revealed at TennoCon 2024. Having a social hub in a game like this is always beneficial, and you can see them in Warframe, as well as games like Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft, for example. In Soulframe, you will be able to experience the first player social hub called Silent Rose Cave. In this social hub, players will be given the opportunity to chat with NPCs and get to know them better, accept new side quests to embark on, as well as the opportunity to meet other Envoys that you may want to party up with before you go on your next adventure.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll be able to join the hunt in Orengall's new Fable, where you'll be given the option to forge a new pact with the wolf. If you're someone who likes to jump into group content and deal some damage in dungeons, they'll now have an extra layer of difficulty. While you may have found that the dungeons were a bit easy in the past, they will now have new environmental hazards, such as acid or poison on the floor. There will be additional challenges that you'll have to contend with in the crooked corridors, and this will change how you navigate through the dungeon.</p>
<p>Finally, the Envoy character creation, which was showcased at <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-looks-promising-in-new-tennocon-showcase-digital-extremes-will-talk-a-lot-more-about-it-in-2024/">TennoCon 2024</a>, will now be available and playable for those who want to add their own personal touch to their envoy. Of course, with such an expansive update, there will also be other quality-of-life improvements from members of the community who have already played the game. This includes fixing the combat tree UI and reworking the potion system in Soulframe Preludes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-announces-project-k-card-games-based-on-league-of-legends<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> is getting the card game treatment. The latest addition to the beloved franchise is called Project K, and its launch will include official organized play support.</p>

<h2>The Project K Announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of Project K was made via an official video on Riot Games' YouTube channel. The game is a competitive experience, similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, just with characters and locations from <em>League of Legends</em>. It will support 1v1, 2v2, and four-player free-for-all games.</p>


<p>According to game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai, the game is being developed by a small team within Riot Games. In addition, this is not a physical version of its digital card game <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> but an original experience that draws from the deep lore and characters of the franchise.</p>

<p>The trailer shows some of the cards. There are familiar faces such as Jinx, Viktor, Volibear, and Yasuo as well as recognizable locations like Zaun. Each of the characters appear to have two different colors, but there don't appear to be any resources like <em>Magic: The Gathering's</em> mana. This is speculation since the game is still in development.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the video, Chai mentions that organized play will be supported for <em>Project K</em> at launch. This will include local play events at hobby shops, competitive events up to the national level, and even global tournaments.</p>

They already have a publishing partner for the game's release in China in early 2025. A global launch is planned, but they are currently seeking publishers for the US and EU.</p>

<p><em>Project K</em> is the latest expansion to the <em>League of Legends</em> series. The iconic MOBA has seen single-player spin-offs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mageseeker-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mageseeker</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ruined-king-league-of-legends-story" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ruined King</em>,</a> the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/2xko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>2XKO</em></a> fighting game, and the critically acclaimed animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arcane</em></a>.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the actors with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode have quit the game, according to a new claim. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1865103558414340269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Call of Duty leaker GhostOfHope says that they have left the game due to a lack of protection against AI.</p>



<p>“Almost all of the actors that feature in the Zombies crew in Black Ops 6 Zombies have pulled out of working over the lack of AI protections in their contracts,” Hope said. “This has resulted in some of the disappointing recasts we are now seeing early on (Ex: SAM on Citadelle), with some likely still to be recast in future maps etc.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Concerns of AI protection for video game actors is nothing new. SAG-AFTRA members are currently striking against game studios for that exact reason after negotiations with studios failed to deliver any sort of guarantees for actors. The strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially began</a> in July after 18 months of negotiations, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues without a deal</a>.</p>



<p>One of those studios the union is in negotiations with just happens to be Activision Blizzard as well as EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, Warner Bros. Games, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review.1054236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took an hour of playing Path of Exile 2’s early access version to know I’d soon be firing up an Excel spreadsheet and saying goodbye to all my loved ones for the foreseeable future. Just when I thought I was out, the heartless maniacs (in a good way) at Grinding Gears Games have pulled me back in with a sequel to one of my favorite action RPGs of all time – a game which has already consumed much of my life since it came out a decade ago. The gameplay, endgame mechanics, and insanely intricate buildcrafting all take massive steps forward, and even though it’s subject to many of the usual “early access jank” caveats and suffers from some seriously stingy loot drops right now, there’s already a lot to love about this fantastic, time-destroying ARPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per all the genre’s usual tendencies, you can expect to spend your time blasting your way through armies of enemies in search of loot, taking down big, gross-looking bosses, and teleporting back to town to sell off your spoils roughly every two minutes due to your insanely small inventory space. In its presently unfinished state, it takes about 60 hours of battling your way through the first three acts of the campaign (of a planned six) twice in a row (on a higher difficulty the second time) before you hit the impressively extensive endgame, where even more angry mobs and shiny gear waits for you. And although it has plenty of technical jank and placeholders labeled “coming soon” where features should be, the vast majority of my multi-day marathon to get there was overwhelmingly enjoyable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, Path of Exile 2 doesn’t exactly rock the storytelling boat – it sticks with the usual tale of horrifying abominations which threaten to destroy the world and immortal beings treating mortals as pawns – but that doesn’t mean it’s boring or without the occasional twist and turn. Getting to know the cast of characters and unraveling the otherworldly culture and history featured in each act is a particular highlight. I grew quite fond of Alva, a treasure hunter who loves adventure almost as much as she loves making quick exits whenever danger shows up, and getting to know the Maraketh, a brutal group of desert survivalist nomads, was very compelling. We don’t know what the second half of that story has in store, so the jury’s still out on whether or not it’ll stick the landing, but so far it’s off to a decent, if not entirely original start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Path of Exile 2 plays it safe with the story, it swings for the fences when it comes to ambitious gameplay, and the result is one of the most irresistibly playable action-RPGs to-date. After picking one of the six classes currently available (Grinding Gear says there will be 12 eventually) you’ll start down the long, arduous path of making heads or tails of their incomprehensibly complex skill trees. They almost seem like they were designed to be sarcastically dense as you slowly piece together a build you like – it only takes one look at the main passive perk tree, which has over 1,500 perks to choose from, to realize you’re gonna be fogging up those nerd glasses quite a bit. Then you’ll bring those abilities and equipment to bear on all manner of zombies and weird lizard monsters in a relentless hunt for loot and XP that, if you’re as eager to smash the next fleshy pinata open to see what’s inside as I am, is prone to keep you up long into the night. Throw in the fact that maps are procedurally generated and offer a pretty high degree of replayability while also managing to not feel like they weren’t handcrafted, and you’re liable to lose yourself for the better part of a week like I did.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each class offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a plethora of gameplay improvements over Path of Exile 2’s predecessor that make slashing through hordes of monsters endlessly entertaining, including dodge-rolling that adds a much-needed skill component to keeping yourself alive, WASD support that makes movement so much better, and other quality-of-life improvements that bring Path of Exile 2 much more in line with its modern peers. But in a lot of ways it surpasses them, too, with action-packed combat that feels a lot less passive than, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review"><u>Diablo 4</u></a>, where you might find yourself hypnotically using the same combination of abilities over and over again as you plow through enemies. You can certainly get to an insane level of power eventually, but the vast majority of the time enemies will at least put up a fight, especially during boss battles where you’ll need to learn your foe’s attack patterns to survive. This ends up making combat feel a lot more like a proper action game than most action-RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that each of the classes offers a unique way to play that dramatically mixes things up to a much greater degree than other ARPGs. For example, choosing the Dexterity-focused Ranger will have you keeping your distance, dancing around the map, and most importantly, focusing on your Evasion stat which gives you a chance to completely ignore attacks that land on you – but if you ever do manage to get hit by something big, like a boss, you’re toast. Alternatively, if you choose a Warrior, you’ll be running into close-quarters battle wearing the thickest armor you can find and focus on cleaving the enemy in two before they can whittle down your health. Meanwhile, the Mercenary trades a sword for a crossbow that effectively turns the entire adventure into a top-down shooter that feels very unlike any other character. For my part, I spent the majority of my time as a Witch focusing on a minions build that let my thrall do the fighting for me, so I often spent my time just supporting my undead homies and shouting words of encouragement. That’s a level of gameplay diversity I haven’t seen Path of Exile 2’s contemporaries achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the eyebrow-raisingly complex passive perk trees, your skill and support gem loadouts, the Atlas perk tree and Ascendancy tree (which are two endgame trees with even more effects to consider), and your overall equipment loadout, there are about a dozen extremely convoluted systems to learn if you hope to master your character, and in this case that’s great news. When you decide to play them more than casually, ARPGs are all about burying your face into horrifyingly complicated menus searching for the most powerful possible combination of stats, and Path of Exile 2 delivers on this front even more than its predecessors. It might take a while (okay, actually <em>quite a long</em> <em>while</em>) to figure out how each piece of the puzzle works, especially if you’re diving in early before the hardcore crowd gets hold of it and creates step-by-step recipes you can follow, but doing so makes for an awesome time if, like me, you’re into that terribly nerdy business. The only thing that’s a bit irritating about playing the early access version now is that not every skill tree has been finished, so you might want to chase a specific build or power, only to find out that power is still just a twinkle in the designers’ eyes. That could, for example, mean you aren’t able to purchase support skills to complement your build and take it in a different direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Path of Exile 2 definitely falls short, though, is with its loot. That’s not because the items you get are bad (finding a sceptre that let my Witch summon even more undead minions was quite nice, for example), but because it’s incredibly stingy with them. The first issue is that there seems to be no protection at all in ensuring the loot that drops is geared towards your chosen class – and even if you find stuff that is, it’s often not good or won’t work with your build since you’ll frequently require highly specific items to improve upon it. I didn’t even see a single Unique (a powerful, curated tier of items) drop until I had played for over 60 hours, and when I finally did it was a bow that my magic-focused character had no way of using. You can always trade with other players for gear you need, but it still feels pretty awful to grind your face off and not see anything worthwhile come of it, especially if you’d rather not interact with other people.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope loot gets at least a little more generous during early access.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, while there are a few options for taking middling items and leveling them up with new perks and higher rarities to improve your chances, these don’t come close to fixing how anticlimactic loot drops often feel, and you’ll likely find yourself using your best items long after you’ve leveled beyond them for sheer lack of alternatives. None of this should come as a surprise from fans of the first Path of Exile, as loot has always been hard to come by there as well, but it’s really something I thought Grinding Gear might address in this followup. Obviously it’s been a successful approach with the audience Path of Exile has built, but in my book that’s a pretty big miss for an ARPG, where cool loot can be a major selling point. I hope the loot dial gets turned at least a little toward the more rewarding side of things during the early access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you plan to jump in at launch, hopefully you really enjoy your first playthrough of Path of Exile 2’s first three campaign acts, because right now you’ll have to give them a second go if you want to reach the endgame content. That’s because, instead of finishing all six acts for the early access build, Grinding Gear focused on the first three and wisely directed the rest of its attention to fleshing out the endgame so that it can be finely honed for the full launch. That was a smart choice generally speaking, but instead of letting you beat the first half of the story and immediately advance to the post-campaign grind, it instead makes you play through the whole thing twice – with no changes in the second run aside from scaled-up enemy levels – before finally granting you access to the endgame. Even though I enjoyed the story, playing it all again back to back just to reach an arbitrary character level left a bad taste in my mouth and makes things unnecessarily repetitive at the moment. It’s especially weird that the second run, called “Cruel Mode,” isn’t actually harder – in fact, it was a whole lot easier since I knew what was coming and had a far stronger build. That makes the whole second playthrough pretty monotonous. Couldn’t they have just boosted our characters and equipment to the proper level instead?</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Isometric Action Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, once you do manage to progress into the endgame, you’re in for a good time: Path of Exile 2 is surprisingly fleshed out on this front despite being quite unfinished. The main course is the Atlas, a massive, procedurally generated map that lets you explore nodes to reach objectives, including mysterious merchants, hidden boss fights, and more surprises lying in wait – it’s kind of like Diablo meets Super Mario World’s overworld map in the best way. While very similar to the original’s endgame, this version expands and improves on virtually every aspect and has been a complete blast to explore. I’ve likely only just scratched the surface after more than a dozen hours with it, but I could already see myself dumping another hundred hours into this thing. Beyond that, there are trials that pit you against special objectives and challenging modifiers to unlock powerful rewards and progress down your Ascendancy perk tree, as well as an endgame boss that serves as the final gauntlet for Path of Exile 2’s most dedicated adventurers. It’s an impressive amount of content and quite well thought out, especially for an early access game, but that’s hardly surprising given the first Path of Exile’s decade-plus of lessons learned while building upon its own endgame content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a robust endgame hasn’t saved Path of Exile 2 from much of the usual jankiness that comes with early access games. I saw everything from the minor stuff, like framerate hiccups, to the extremely infuriating stuff, like that time a patch removed all of the skill gems, support gems, and the best weapon from my inventory, all but destroying my build and forcing me to grind much of it back. Per usual, I recommend waiting to hop in if you’re the type of person to throw their controller out the window when things don’t work as intended, as playing in early access isn’t for the faint of heart and your prized loot could vanish in an instant. It’s a testament to how good everything else is that these issues didn’t completely turn me off from continuing to play. It’s also worth mentioning that Path of Exile 2 already looks and sounds much better than its predecessor, even if it still doesn’t look nearly as good as a AAA cohort like Diablo 4 – so it’s a notable visual upgrade, but nothing that blew my socks off.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">At its early access launch, Path of Exile 2 is already shaping up to be the sequel we’ve been waiting for. Everything from the refined fundamental action-RPG gameplay to the surprisingly fleshed-out endgame has seen major improvements, and the half of the story we’ve got so far shows plenty of promise, even if the setting feels a little generic in the realm of dark fantasy worlds. The downside of playing in early access, though, is that you’ll have to slog through all three acts twice to reach the endgame, the loot game needs some major tweaking to more consistently reward us with usable items, and some mild-to-severe technical wonkiness might take the wind out of your sails if things go awry – but it’s nothing that makes me concerned for the future of this expansive sequel. Even while we wait for 1.0, Path of Exile 2 is already a stellar way to lose dozens of hours and a clear leap forward for the series.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Over the years, Path of Exile has become the action role-playing game to play for those looking for a truly hardcore experience. The game by Grinding Gear Games grants players almost complete control over characters, providing players with tons of customization options and almost complete freedom to create their builds. As such, it wasn't surprising to see the ARPG community getting really excited about the announcement of Path of Exile 2, as right from the get-go, it looked like it would address some of the issues of its predecessor while ramping up everything that makes it such a hardcore and engaging experience.</p>
<p>A few months back, I had the chance to check out Path of Exile 2 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-gamescom-hands-on-preview-improvements-aplenty/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and I was thoroughly impressed by its gigantic passive skill tree, the new Mercenary class, which almost turns the experience into a top-down twin-stick shooter, the customization options that involve both the character and skills, and most of all, the versatility of these options. My demo playthrough was rather short, essentially covering the first 40 minutes or so of the first act, but it definitely left me hungering for more.</p>
<p>All my positive impressions of Path of Exile 2 were pretty much confirmed in my time, with the Early Access version now available on PC and consoles after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/">three-week delay</a>. While the game is sure to change a lot until the 1.0 version release, the experience already delivers the promise of a modernized take on the original's formula.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.34.14.94-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right after selecting your character's class among Warrior, Ranger, Mercenary, Sorceress, Monk, and Witch, all featuring two Ascendancy Classes for further customization, players are thrown straight back into Wraeclast, 20 years after the events of the original campaign where the main characters went on a god-killing spree, leaving humanity alone to clean up the consequences and begin life anew. Needless to say, things haven't been going too well for humanity, as the world is far from being right. Among those who have suffered from the evil that is still being done in Wraeclast is the player-controlled exile, who was sentenced to death for an unknown reason by the Count of Ogham. After narrowly escaping their death sentence, this exile eventually travels back to their village to confront the Count, all the while meeting a variety of individuals who also suffered at his hands and at the monstrosities he had unleashed on the land in his bid for power.</p>
<p>After confronting the Count, the exile will get to learn more about the mysteries surrounding him, embarking on an adventure that, sadly, cannot yet be experienced in full as the Early Access release only features the first three of the six acts of the complete campaign. From this small portion of the entire adventure, however, it is clear how the developer is doing an excellent job expanding the lore of and history of Wraeclast, convincingly creating a dark and haunting atmosphere that permeates the world, with narration and visuals, powered by a new graphics engine which also allows the gameplay to reach new heights.</p>
<p>This new graphics engine made it possible for Grinding Gear Games to address one of the most common complaints in the original Path of Exile: combat. In Path of Exile 2, fighting both mobs and bosses is extremely satisfying, as players have way more control over their offensive and defensive options, both of them covered by certain skills such as the Warrior's Grand Slam and the Ranger's Escape Shot. Among the defensive options featured in the game is also a simple dodge roll maneuver with no cooldown that allows the exile to roll out of the way and prevent getting damaged. The introduction of this evasive maneuver was pretty much a necessity, given how much enemy design has increased in complexity, especially for bosses.</p>
<p>The battles against these powerful enemies are one of the highlights of the experience, as each boss I have encountered featured complex and varied movesets that required me to always be on my toes to avoid getting defeated and being sent back to the last checkpoint. From huge warriors armed with likewise huge weapons to worms spewing poison to ancient beings slinging elemental spells left and right, Path of Exile 2 truly seems to have it all. Better yet, the challenge level is generally pretty high, forcing players not only to hone their skills and learn to use the new mechanics appropriately but also to take a deeper look at the customization options. The original is somewhat known for being a "problem-solving" game where players must take a good look at every option the game offers to overcome obstacles, and the same can definitely be said about Path of Exile 2, which already offers a massive wealth of options even in its very first release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.36.03.76-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The aforementioned six available classes are literally only the beginning of the journey, in terms of buildcrafting. Focusing on either one or two stats, the classes only determine the starting stats, the place where the player begins on the massive skill tree, and the starting equipment and skill found in the tutorial area. Once past this small area, the game opens up in terms of customization options, allowing the exiles to use every weapon, piece of gear, and skill in the game if their stats allow for it. The flexibility of the system is well-represented not only by the ability to increase any of the core stats - Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence - by unlocking specific nodes on the skill tree but also by the overhauling of the Skill system of the original Path of Exile. Instead of requiring slots on weapons, it is now possible to equip skills obtained after carving Skill Gems in dedicated slots that are available regardless of the currently equipped gear.</p>
<p>In addition, each Skill can be further customized with Support Gems that grant different effects, such as elemental buildup, wider ranger, and so on. All these support abilities have a cost in terms of stats, so it is only possible to equip a certain number of them, which varies depending on the stat they require. A mechanic that, in conjunction with the gear system, further deepens character customization. The gear system is essentially the same as in the original, featuring all sorts of items with different rarity levels that can be a little difficult to manage due to the unchanged inventory system that fills up pretty quickly, forcing players to return to their current main base to stash items in excess.</p>
<p>Customizing characters and skills is all well and good, but it would mean nothing if classes weren't fun to play, or skills satisfying to use. Again, being in Early Access, the game balance is going to change a lot over time, but in this initial version, there's no doubt that Path of Exile 2 is a fun game to play, no matter the class, although some may be more fun to use than others, depending on personal preference. Liking to go face-to-face with enemies, I picked the Warrior first, but I wasn't exactly feeling the class at the beginning, as I did not like some of the low-level skills available. Once I learned some additional skills and some effective ways to combine them, the class became more fun to use. Other classes, like the Mercenary and the Monk, on the other hand, felt more fun to use right from the start, especially the Monk with his elemental abilities with very different ranges, which make the class pretty versatile in all sorts of situations. Experimentation will be key in Path of Exile 2 for a very long time to discover some effective builds and skill combos, and thankfully, it shouldn't be too difficult to do so, as it is possible to reset the entire passive skill tree easily a few hours into the first act.</p>
<p>While combat and customization mechanics are already extremely solid, the same cannot exactly be said for maps. While they are rather big, the biggest of them requiring more than 15 minutes to explore fully, they are a little empty as of now, only featuring enemies of the common and rare variety and the occasional treasure chest. More events and quests going beyond the fetch quest type would help the experience a lot, but as of now, there isn't anything else to do on maps other than destroy the hordes of enemies that assail the exile.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Path-of-Exile-Screenshot-2024.12.02-17.13.53.33-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As described above, Path of Exile 2 can feel a little daunting, especially for those used to much simpler ARPGs. Thankfully, players looking into getting into the series for the first time won't have to worry too much about min-maxing their characters or going for the meta builds that will surely develop in the future, as the campaign, while definitely challenging, can be completed without delving too deep into the game's customization mechanics, giving them the chance to understand all of its intricacies more before going through the first three acts of the campaign again at increased difficulty and the endgame where the possibilities of the mechanics will be stretched the furthest. The amazing controller implementation also makes the game very easy to get into.</p>
<p>Being in Early Access, every aspect of Path of Exile 2 will inevitably improve over time, but as a starting point, the first public release of the game is solid enough in terms of visuals and performance. Simply put, the game is one of the best-looking ARPGs to date, featuring incredibly diverse locations enhanced by the global illumination system which also improves its dark atmosphere greatly, and very detailed character models. Great attention has been placed on animations as well, and it shows, as all characters are smoothly animated, making using skills or dodging enemy attacks feel way more satisfying than in the original.</p>
<p>Supporting all three major upscalers - NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS - as well as NIS, Path of Exile 2 provides all the options players need to get the game running decently on their machines. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS at the Quality setting, Frame Generation, and the settings below, the game generally ran at above 100 FPS even with multiple enemies on screen on the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM). The framerate can only be capped at up to 120 FPS as of now, so it is not possible to go beyond this target, but still, it should be more than enough for everyone for this type of game.</p>

<p>While there haven't been many technical issues on the client side in my around 20 hours with Path of Exile 2, besides some random crashes at the start of the game that forced me to boot it up a few times before finally going through the log-in process, I have experienced some server-side issues, including some performance hiccups with rubber banding issues, and inability to create a new instance, which prevented me from entering new areas unless I logged out and back in. As the servers are likely going to be hammered by players in the first few days after launch, I would expect these issues to be somewhat common, although Grinding Gear Games has promised to be ready for what is likely to be a very successful launch.</p>
<p>Featuring only the first three acts of the full campaign and only half of the classes that will be available in time for the 1.0 release, it is not possible to say at the time if Path of Exile 2 will indeed deliver all of its promises. The Early Access version, however, made it clear how Grinding Gear Games has a very strong idea of how to evolve the formula of its predecessor to deliver an experience that is, undoubtedly, very fun at all skill levels. Considering how the game manages to be both extremely welcoming and extremely deep at the same time, I have no doubt that Path of Exile 2 will only get better from here on out, having the potential to become one of the best action role-playing games ever released.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation in Riyadh has announced a multi-year partnership with Activision’s Call of Duty League. This partnership has been dubbed ‘a key component of EWCF’s commitment to fuel the sustainable growth of esports’ by the Saudi Arabian gaming company.</p>



<p>It wasn’t made too clear what the partnership will entail, but it comes just days after both Black Ops 6 and Warzone were confirmed to be appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-life-changing-global-event">‘Life-Changing Global Event’</h2>



<p>It’s expected that this partnership will go beyond the Esports World Cup in 2025, but the press release that landed today with this news was a little vague about what the partnership means for COD esports.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chief Games Officer at the EWCF, Fabian Scheuermann, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty&nbsp;is one of the most celebrated games on the planet and has captivated global communities for generations. Together, we are creating new opportunities for players, from grassroots to elite competitors, to rise through the ranks and compete on the world’s biggest stage. </p>



<p>As we continue to grow the largest-ever celebration of esports excellence, we look forward to welcoming all players into a life-changing global event, one that connects players, games, fans, and the entire esports industry under one banner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Daniel Tsay, the general manager of Call of Duty Esports at Activision, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Call of Duty League&nbsp;is thrilled to partner with the Esports World Cup to support the continued growth of competitive Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Our pro players and affiliated orgs had a great time competing during last year’s EWC tournament and showcased how fun and intense pro-am style competition can be.&nbsp;This partnership gives our players, community and fans even more opportunities to enjoy premium competitive Call of Duty for years to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three-year partnership will hopefully be given a little more meat in the coming weeks as the Call of Duty League 2025 season unravels. It’s set to commence today, with a slew of matches running through the weekend to welcome back COD’s top-tier competitive ecosystem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/free-to-play-strategy-rpg-girls-frontline-2-exilium-launches-on-pc-and-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Direct a team of characters in tactical turn-based combat.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Girls Frontline series is back with the free-to-play strategy RPG Girls Frontline 2: Exilium, which recently launched on PC and mobile. It introduces a new cast of characters and fully 3D maps while building on the groundwork laid by its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the franchise, this is a sequel to the 2018 free-to-play mobile game Girls Frontline. It introduced a war-torn future world in which much of humanity has died, and they now rely on androids called Tactical Dolls, also known as T-Dolls or Dolls, to fight their battles for them. Players took on the role of a commander in charge of Doll combat teams, known as echelons. The first title spawned a manga and multiple anime series, and now the sequel follows in their footsteps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium picks up 10 years later and features significant gameplay evolution. You still play as the same commander from the first game, but your team has been disbanded and you are now a bounty hunter. You’ll need to recruit new Dolls to form a squad and lead them in turn-based combat as you try to uncover the truth behind a growing conspiracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat has gotten a big overhaul. The original featured a 2D map that you would move echelons across to engage enemies, at which point you’d enter combat that was based on where characters were placed within a formation. Girls Frontline 2: Exilium is fully 3D with tactical combat, and you take direct control of each character to move them across the map and execute commands.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dolls are anime-style personifications of a wide variety of real-world weapons and come equipped with those weapons, including handguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, and shotguns. Each weapon has been created in 3D, is viewable from any angle, and can be displayed in your personal weapon gallery. You’ll also be able to apply different skins to your weapons, giving you some customization options for your collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are grouped into classes that define their combat role. Bulwarks are your classic tanks, acting as frontline fighters who can provide defensive buffs to your team. Sentinels are your primary offensive characters, focused on dishing out as much damage as possible. Vanguards can help provide damage too, but their biggest advantage is their high mobility, which allows them to set up flanking maneuvers on enemies. And finally, Supports provide healing or buff their teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each character is weak to one element and one ammo type, so you need to be careful how you build each of your combat teams. You don’t want them all to be weak to the same attacks. Enemies have these weaknesses too, so you’re incentivized to build a team capable of capitalizing on a wide range of weaknesses to turn combat in your favor.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/05/combat-page-2-1733425496620.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike its predecessor, Girls Frontline 2 allows you to move characters freely around the battlefield during combat and find objects to take cover behind. When a character is behind cover, damage against them will be dramatically reduced. But hitting them with attacks they’re weak against will drain their Stability stat, and once that reaches zero, their defense will be broken and they’ll no longer get the benefits of being behind cover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means you need to be strategic about how you use each of your characters. Since enemies are weak to an element and an ammo type, it’s possible for one character with the right combination of attributes to hit both weaknesses with one attack. That drains Stability even faster, which quickly breaks enemies' defenses and leaves them susceptible to devastating follow-up attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, you can also spend down time with your squad members in the Refitting Room or Dormitory. Both offer full 3D interactivity and show off the game’s non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) anime art style. You’ll need to recruit new characters to expand your squad, and Girls Frontline 2 is celebrating release by providing in-game rewards that can help.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/05/official-launch-rewards-overview-1733423919008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get a rundown of all the goodies on offer in the image above, including codes you can redeem and rewards from multiple events.

5, but the real intrigue lies within the two new playable agents HoYoverse is bringing to the game via the 1.4 update. A Storm of Falling Stars will introduce Hoshimi Miyabi, one of the game's new playable characters. Miyabi is the chief of Section 6, the youngest Void Hunter in the universe, and a Frost Anomaly agent who wields a sword. The second character hitting the game on December 18 is Asaba Harumasa, which Shi describes as an "Electric Attack agent whose weapon can shift between bow and blade." Harumasa can also weave in and out of the battlefield with ease.</p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay itself is also seeing some changes when A Storm of Falling Stars goes live.</p><p dir="ltr">"In version 1.4, Hollow Zero will undergo the major update, Shadows Lost, where Proxies plunge into fierce battles within the Lost Void, armed with additional support and equipment including weapons, Bangboo assist skill, and Resonia," Shi explained.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Anbernic announced its next retro handheld today and it’s easy to see where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64M_BHXsiiE&amp;t=1s">design of the RG34XX draws its inspiration</a>. It appears to be a faithful clone of Nintendo’s original Game Boy Advance, although updated with <a href="https://x.com/KeepRetro/status/1865057457157877766">additional action and shoulder buttons</a> allowing games from more recent systems to be played. Pricing and availability hasn’t been revealed yet, but the RG34XX will come in transparent red and green colors, as well as the GBA’s purple and black.</p><p>One feature Anbernic didn’t carry forward is the Game Boy Advance’s LCD screen which lacked a backlight and was notoriously difficult to see unless you were playing outside on a sunny day or cozied up next to a bright lamp. The RG34XX will instead feature a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution. The display will also use the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Game Boy Advance, so GBA titles should look great, and older games developed for 4:3 TV screens will fit without extensive stretching or pillarboxing.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RG34XX will be available in purple or black colors, and transparent red or green.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p>As with previous Anbernic handhelds, the RG34XX doesn’t have a cartridge slot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date">ModRetro Chromatic</a>. It’s instead designed to play games through software emulation. Details on the RG34XX’s processor aren’t known yet, but <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-announced/">Retro Handhelds speculates</a> it will be based on the Allwinner H700 chipset the company has <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx">used in its other XX series handhelds</a>. If that’s the case, you can expect it to play games from older consoles up to the original Sony PlayStation, and even some N64 and Sega Dreamcast titles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The RG34XX will include two sets of shoulder buttons, a mini HDMI port, USB-C for charging, and dual microSD slots.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p>The RG34XX will include Wi-Fi connectivity facilitating online play as well as streaming PC titles through <a href="https://moonlight-stream.org/">Moonlight</a>, and Bluetooth for connecting multiple wireless controllers for shared screen multiplayer. If that 3.4-inch screen still seems too small, the RG34XX also includes a mini HDMI port for connecting it to a TV, alongside a USB-C port for charging, and a pair of microSD card slots for storing ROMs and its operating system.</p><div><p>This isn’t the first time that Anbernic has copied Nintendo’s homework. Earlier this year the company released its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152105/can-you-resist-anbernics-game-boy-advance-sp-that-plays-ps1-and-n64-games">RG35XXSP with a design inspired by the clamshell Game Boy Advance SP</a> but with an improved screen, a more capable processor, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177983/this-amazing-knockoff-gba-sp-comes-stuffed-with-software-piracy">concerning number of pre-installed pirated ROMs</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other shows have been uploaded to YouTube and emulate the interactivity using on-screen links and cards that take you to other archived videos.

There is a fear in the community that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">Netflix</a></span> will crack down on their efforts if these alternative options are too publicly shared online. </p><p>Pixel told <em>404 Media</em> that Netflix’s interactive shows relied on an “internal video” that contained all the different paths and endings. According to the archivist, these interactive shows were controlled by two JSON files. One controlled decisions and where to skip to in the video and the other file pulled in assets for the buttons.</p><p>“We currently have a proof-of-concept emulator running off a Python script that uses the JSONs to make functioning decisions, although it needs ironing out and button images are broken as of now,” explained Pixel. “We have a member of the team in Turkey that is hosting the files for once we get the emulator working on a webpage.”</p><p>According to Pixel, right now the biggest challenge the fans face in archiving all of this deleted Netflix content is keeping track of everything. </p><p>“We have a lot of people counting on us,” said Pixel, “And I get a LOT of DMs from people asking how to play them.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Marvel Rivals GB file size question is upon us. With so many different platforms to house superhero battles of titanic proportions, you need to know how much storage to keep free. We’ve got the lowdown on Marvel Rivals’ file size on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Before you can have fun, we first need to know if you’re <em>allowed </em>to have fun. To play Marvel Rivals and Punish-er people, you need to have the necessary allocation of space. Whether it’s a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC, it’s all the same. In today’s age of gaming, it’s not uncommon for games to exceed 100GB, which can mean sacrifices have to be made.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a mighty game, so let’s see how much stress it places on your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-playstation-5">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not bad. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals requires 36.58 GB of free space on a PlayStation 5 to let you install it and play it—at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>Round this up and call it 40 GB, which allows for future updates to increase the size anyway. All in all, I think 36 GB is quite generous, and with Call of Duty suffocating my PS5’s storage, this is a blessing.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>On Xbox, Marvel Rivals requires 44.56 GB of empty storage space, and, again, this is before any updates potentially increase this figure.</strong></p>



<p>The information comes courtesy of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/12/04/marvel-rivals-pre-load-is-up-on-xbox-install-size-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, and it does mean players associated with the green brand need a little more free space than those on PlayStation—I’m not here to flame or cause any wars! If you do take umbrage with Xbox’s slightly higher GB requirements, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-cross-platform-crossplay-cross-progression-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals has crossplay</a>, so settle your score on the battlefield.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-marvel-rivals-on-pc">How Many GB is Marvel Rivals on PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s manageable. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A quick check of Steam shows Marvel Rivals needs 47.5 GB on PC, and this makes it the highest GB total of any platform.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I couldn’t tell you why PC players get it worse, but this is the case. Again, it’s less than 50 GB, and for an intense online multiplayer title with deep visuals and a ton of on-screen action, you can’t complain. If you are struggling, either uninstall a game or two or consider upgrading your internal storage.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, check out the complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC specs</a> required to play Marvel Rivals.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tiktok-is-now-one-step-closer-to-being-banned-in-the-united-states.1054143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the United States, a federal appeals court has stood firm in the face of TikTok’s attempts to avoid a blanket ban across the nation. The court upheld a law that has been tossed to and fro for years, with US legislators seeking to <strong>force </strong>ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, into a divestiture in the United States.</p>



<p>Despite the application being used by more than 150 million Americans, lawmakers in the US have been trying to ban it for several years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us">Will TikTok Be Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>This all stems from the United States’ insistence that ByteDance and TikTok are linked to the Chinese state, which the tech titan has actively denied on several occasions. </p>



<p>On the decision, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>TikTok’s millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication. That burden is attributable to China’s hybrid commercial threat to&nbsp;US national security, not to the US government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated by the appeals court that the law being lobbied in an attempt to ban the app <em>“was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents. It was carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC.”</em></p>



<p>TikTok has some US forces in its pocket, though. In a statement, the deputy director of ACLU’s National Security, Patrick Toomey, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Banning TikTok blatantly violates the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans who use this app to express themselves and communicate with people around the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Presently, ByteDance has until January 19 to sell or divest TikTok’s assets in the United States – or face a nationwide ban. There’s a chance that President Biden could grant an extension to that deadline, and ByteDance has moved to challenge the decision of the appeals court in the Supreme Court, but it’s all still up in the air.</p>



<p>In the run-up to his successful election campaign, Donald Trump said he’d block the ban – four years after trying to actively shut the application down in the United States. However, if no extension lands and the Supreme Court refuses to help, Donald Trump won’t be in office before the deadline arrives, which renders his support moot.</p>



<p>Would you suffer if TikTok was banned in the United States? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Riot Games has big plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/league-of-legends-review/1900-6415183/" data-ref-id="1900-6415183">League of Legends</a> in 2025, and they aren't limited to the original game. Project K, the new League of Legends-inspired trading card game, is on its way to a global rollout next year. And in the announcement video below, Project K looks like it's going after Magic the Gathering fans with some very familiar game mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1j7zvA3Sy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y1j7zvA3Sy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As laid out above by game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai, Project K supports 1v1 matches, but it can also include up to four players in 2v2 battles or free-for-all encounters. Riot Games also has grand ambitions of expanding the reach of Project K by partnering with stores for local events in addition to larger national and international tournaments featuring the best players in the world.</p><p>However, Riot Games doesn't appear to have a publishing and promotional partner in the US TGC scene yet. That's why Project K's initial launch will take place in the Chinese market in early 2025. According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/490418/league-legends-card-game-tcg-riot-games-project-k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Riot wants Project K's American launch to be as close as possible to the Chinese debut. But for now, there's no firm date for Project K's release in the United States.</p><p>Earlier this week, Riot addressed some of the fan backlash it received over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-push-back-against-league-of-legends-characters-arcane-makeover/1100-6528263/" data-ref-id="1100-6528263">Viktor's Arcane-inspired makeover</a> in League of Legends. The company has also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">League of Legends is introducing a seasonal model</a> starting in January 2025. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a> wrapped up its two-season run on Netflix last month, Riot has indicated that more adaptations are on the way. They just won't involve Avengers: Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo, because the duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-got-paid-5-million-to-not-make-a-league-of-legends-movie-report/1100-6527614/" data-ref-id="1100-6527614">was paid $5 million</a> after their plans to make a live-action League of Legends movie fell apart over creative differences.</p>
