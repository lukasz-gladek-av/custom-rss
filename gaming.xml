			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

            <p>
What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> was a bit less sci-fi, and a lot more medieval? You would, in theory, get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, a game that first entered early access in June last year. Responses to it so far appear to be, well, mixed, but as seems to be quite common with These Kinds Of Games, everyone that's played it appears to be going through some kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of situation, as the game is still going. It's going so far as to launch into 1.0 in fact, and developer Mainframe Industries have even put a date to it.
</p>
<p>
That release date is October 16th, about half a month away at the time of writing (assuming I still know how to read calendars). Mainframe outlined what you can expect in the leadup to the launch, as well as what will happen at launch itself in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/510718530665054707?l=english">Steam news post</a> too.
</p>
<p>
From October 6th until the 14th, servers for the game will be completely offline. On the 14th, at 3am PDT, anyone that owns a founder's pack will have access to the game's 1.0 servers, and then on the 16th at 8am PDT, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> will be available to everyone. Something to note is that with the launch of 1.0, everyone that has been playing so far will have everything wiped - shards, characters, plots, inventories, skills, and more. This is the final wipe though, Mainframe explained, so you won't have to worry if you're new to the game.
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that Pax Dei will also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/524223243273373577">subscription model</a>. You can just play the game by buying it, but memberships give you a whole bunch of extras that do seem a little bit unfair. In particular, depending on which membership plan you go for, you'll get a number of plot tokens, which let you literally own certain pieces of land - that you have to continuously pay for with said tokens. Yes, this is essentially digital rent. Whether this works out or not, well, we'll find out in the next few months.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-would-like-to-make-a-peacemaker-game.1312870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/threads-time-trailer-chrono-trigger-jrpg-sea-stars-2000630296</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2-5d-love-letter-to-chrono-trigger-and-other-jrpg-classics-couldn%E2%80%99t-look-any-more-perfect.1312867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Threads of Time</em> be <a href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165">the next<em> Sea of</em> <em>Stars</em>,</a> or instead another tedious JRPG homage that emulates the classics without being able to capture what really made them tick? That was my question when it debuted during <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tgs-2024-tokyo-game-show-final-fantasy-game-pass-1851658415">last year’s Xbox Tokyo Game Show livestream</a>. But every time this indie game has resurfaced since, it’s looked better and better. It returned to TGS 2025 with yet another trailer perfectly calibrated to play on fans’ hopes and dreams for another great 16-bit homage to all-time greats like<em> Chrono Trigger</em>.</p> <p>The turn-based RPG with beautiful pixel art and an amazing 2.5D depth of field is being made by Canada-based Riyo Games and published by Humble Games. There’s a team of over 30 people working on it. We still don’t have a release date but it’s looking in better shape than some flashy projects that dazzle with trailers but fail to actually ship. I hope the team isn’t biting off more than it can chew, especially amid a tough funding environment for smaller indie developers and publishers, because everything in this trailer is exactly what I want from a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> spiritual successor:</p>

  <p>The time-travelling adventure spans millions of years, from a prehistoric past to a cyberpunk future. Turn-based combat takes place in a dynamic view with bespoke attack animations. There’s an overworld map, town hubs, and NPCs to chat up. You’ll recruit characters from different eras and unlock team combos for battle. Why are you doing all this, exactly? It sounds like you’re working for the Order of Time Knights to try and protect the integrity of the timeline or something. Also: cool boss fights.</p> <p><em>Threads of Time</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with hand-crafted 2D pixel art. I can’t stress enough how great the environments and characters look. If that can hold up over an entire 10-20 hour adventure it will be an impressive achievement, especially for the indie studio’s first project. 2023’s <em>Sea of Stars</em> was the last game to pull this trick off, selling like hotcakes and winning nods at The Game Awards that year (DLC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabotagestudio.com/post/3lpmbdqu7w22w">released earlier this year</a>). Before that, there was 2021’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/eastward-the-kotaku-review-1847753920">incredible-looking <em>Eastward</em></a>. I hope <em>Threads of Time</em> can deliver something equally special in the next year or two. It’s currently only confirmed for PC and Xbox.</p>

                <p>As part of the Call of Duty: Next event today, Activision made a series of major announcements about the FPS franchise, including what's next for Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>To begin with, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s integration into Warzone will begin in Season 1, and this will include a brand-new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow. This is a smaller map than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982" data-ratio="0.55223880597015" data-width="2144" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982"></a><figcaption>Haven's Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The map takes place in Liberty Falls, which is the town from Black Ops 6 Zombies prior to the zombie outbreak. Given that timeline, the map doesn't include a zombies aesthetic and instead has a more vibrant color tone, along with many points of interest to explore. The map was designed and developed by High Moon Studios.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big Warzone news from Call of Duty: Next is that Warzone's very first map, Verdansk, is remaining the main map for Warzone going forward. It's not exactly the same map as you remember it, though, as two new POIs have been added: Factory and Signal Station.</p><p>Verdansk was the OG map for Warzone when the game launched in 2020. It remained playable until 2021 when it was removed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-discusses-verdansks-return-and-feedback-so-far/1100-6530838/" data-ref-id="1100-6530838">only to come back earlier this year.</a> Its return prompted a resurgence in Warzone players, so it's no surprise to see Activision stick with it.</p><p>There are gameplay updates in Warzone coming as well, including a limit of five attachments and no Wildcards. Additionally, tactical sprint has been removed and is now only available via the Sprinter perk. The combat roll ability from Black Ops 7 is also coming to Warzone through the Mountaineer perk. Finally, there is greater ground loot coming to Warzone. All of this was confirmed by Charlie Intel.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Warzone gameplay updates:</p><p>- Weapons: 5 attachments only, no Wildcards, Overkill by default <br>- Tactical Sprint removed, now in Sprinter Perk<br>- Combat Roll from BO7 added via Mountaineer Perk <br>- Greater ground loot, including curated weapon builds <a href="https://t.co/C1WWQKT8Z7" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/C1WWQKT8Z7</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973086382529691700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dont-starve-board-game-coming-from-glass-cannon-unplugged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em></a> has gone live. Glass Cannon Unplugged's tabletop adaptation of Klei Interactive's acclaimed survival game has been a blockbuster success, reaching its initial funding goal in five minutes and continuing to climb.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for Don't Starve: The Board Game describes the game as a cooperative roguelike experience. Much like its video game source material, 1-4 players are dropped into a land of magic, mad science, and overwhelmingly filled with cruel elements and monsters. Players will need to work together and do all they can to survive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=CRyLRWyr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=BXmVFos2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is broken up into three different parts. Exploring the wilderness for food, resources, biomes, and secrets. Crafting those resources into weapons, tools, structures, and devices to help you withstand the weather, the dark, and the locals. Finally, the survival element, where you have to manage your hunger, sanity, and health as you traverse the dark world.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has several early bird incentives. If you back the game within its first 72 hours, you'll get the Wolfgang expansion, which introduces the playable Wolfgang character, at no additional cost. The expansion will include an unpainted Wolfgang miniature, a holographic character card, and two ability cards.</p>

<p>In addition, each playable character in the board game has a Fortune digital skin, which can be unlocked in the video game spin-off, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-starve-together-sharing-unlocks-across-platforms-in-future-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve Together</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>For those interested in board game add-ons, the campaign includes playmats, dice towers, cardboard terrain packs, and acrylic monster standee packs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;pledge tiers for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Pledge for $79:</strong> The regular edition of the game with acrylic monster standees, any and all unlocked stretch goals, and Don't Starve Together digital character skins</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $129:</strong> Everything in the standard pledge but with unpainted miniatures for monsters and characters</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$746,128, completely decimating its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign ends October 23.</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-shows-off-everything-coming-to-multiplayer-at-launch.1312795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Reveals Everything Coming Before The End Of The Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-reveals-everything-coming-before-the-end-of-the-year.1312792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

                <p>EA is preparing to go private, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">as the veteran video game company will be sold</a> for an eye-watering sum of $55 billion to an investor consortium made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. While this deal will require regulator approval and a sign-off by stockholders, EA is expecting the deal to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p><p>A privately owned EA could be a very different company when compared to its public incarnation, and it will also have to work off $20 billion of new debt that is being used to finance the buyout. So what does $55 billion buy you these days? Quite a <em>lot</em>, as EA's potential new owners will be acquiring studios, brands, and much more. Here's a broad overview of all things EA</p><h2>EA's various entertainment studios</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817"></a><figcaption>EA has established a rich library of games over the years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg"></figure><p>EA has built up a sizable collection of studios under its portfolio, and several of these have become responsible for EA's biggest hits. Criterion Games has developed several Need for Speed titles, DICE is best known for its work on the Battlefield series, and Maxis made a name for itself with The Sims.</p><p>Then there's Motive Studio--a developer that has alternated between being a support studio and working on big projects like Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake--PopCap Games has developed several popular mobile titles, and Respawn Entertainment has been responsible for several of EA's best single-player games in the modern era.</p><p>BioWare has a storied history, but after mass layoffs at the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, it's not certain what state the famed studio is in. Work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-team-should-scapegoat-dragon-age-to-get-more-resources-former-bioware-dev-says/1100-6533885/" data-ref-id="1100-6533885">new Mass Effect game</a> has been going on for several years now, but the high-profile flop of Anthem and underwhelming sales for Dragon Age: The Veilguard have left people wondering what its future looks like under a privately owned EA.</p><p>The studios listed above are just the tip of the EA iceberg, as the company also has Skate developer Full Circle, EA Gothenburg, Codemasters, and even more subsidiaries.</p><h2>EA Entertainment</h2><ul><li>BioWare (Includes BioWare Austin)</li><li>Criterion Games (Includes Criterion Cheshire)</li><li>DICE (Includes Frostbite Labs)</li><li>EA Baton Rouge</li><li>EA Galway in Galway, Ireland.</li><li>EA Gothenburg</li><li>EA Korea Studio</li><li>EA Capital Games</li><li>EA Redwood Studios</li><li>Firemonkeys Studios</li><li>Glu Mobile</li><li>Playdemic</li><li>Slingshot Games</li><li>Tracktwenty Studios</li><li>Full Circle</li><li>Maxis (Includes Maxis Texas and Maxis Europe)</li><li>Motive Studio (Includes Motive Studio Vancouver)</li><li>Pogo Studios</li><li>PopCap Games (Includes PopCap Shanghai and PopCap Hyderabad)</li><li>Respawn Entertainment (Includes Respawn Vancouver and Respawn Wisconsin)</li><li>Ripple Effect Studios</li></ul><h2>EA Sports</h2><p>The other jewel in the EA crown is its EA Sports division. Anchored by titles with annual soccer, Madden NFL, PGA Tour, and NHL games, recent years have also seen these respective titles become even more lucrative with live-service and online elements added to them.</p><h2>EA Sports studios</h2><ul><li>Codemasters (Includes Codemasters Birmingham and Codemasters Kuala Lumpur)</li><li>EA Cologne</li><li>EA Madrid</li><li>EA Orlando</li><li>EA Romania</li><li>EA Vancouver</li><li>Metalhead Software</li></ul><h2>Big game franchises</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>Throughout its existence, EA has amassed a sizable number of video game IP under its banner. Sure, a lot of these franchises like Army of Two and Titanfall haven't received new entries in years, but ownership of them is still potentially lucrative in an age of transmedia projects. Then there are the licensed IP that EA has worked on, with several Star Wars games under its belt--and more on the way--collaborations with smaller studios that have resulted in critically acclaimed games like Split Fiction being released under the EA Originals label, and various sports games that feature hundreds of official licensing deals to make them as authentic as possible.</p><ul><li>Battlefield</li><li>Need for Speed</li><li>Medal of Honor</li><li>Madden Football</li><li>EA Sports FC</li><li>The Sims</li><li>Mirror's Edge</li><li>Titanfall</li><li>Apex Legends</li><li>Mass Effect</li><li>Dragon Age</li><li>Dead Space</li><li>Plants vs Zombies</li><li>Command and Conquer</li><li>Skate</li><li>Army of Two</li><li>Bejeweled</li><li>Peggle</li></ul><h2>EA All Play</h2><p>EA's mobile-focused label, this part of the company is also involved in digital titles and digital board games.</p><h2>EA Competitive Gaming Division</h2><p>Founded in 2015, the EA CGD focuses on growing esports competitions through games like EA Sports FC and Battlefield.</p><h2>SEED</h2><p>The Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division is EA's incubator for research and development on new technologies, with offices based in Los Angeles and Stockholm.</p><h2>EA Platforms and services</h2><p>In addition to its PC distribution EA App, there's also the subscription service EA Play that's available as a standalone service or as part of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

                <p>As part of Call of Duty: Next today, Activision and Treyarch hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>'s post-launch support, which begins with Season 1. It will be the "biggest in franchise history" as it relates to a Season 1 for a new Call of Duty game, the developer said.</p><p>Specifically, there will be <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1973074806607405487" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven more 6v6 maps</a> added to Black Ops 7 multiplayer in Season 1, along with two new Zombies Survival maps, and one new round-based Zombies map. There could also be new Call of Duty: Warzone content as well.</p><p>Activision historically releases Call of Duty's seasonal content over time and not all at once, often divided between content available at launch and then down the road in a Reloaded update.</p><p>Fans don't have to wait until Season 1 for a new map, though, as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-brings-back-iconic-nuketown-map-and-heres-when/1100-6535119/" data-ref-id="1100-6535119"> latest iteration of Nuketown will arrive prior to Season 1.</a> Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps, including 16 6v6 maps and two maps for the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><h2><strong>When does Season 1 start?</strong></h2><p>Activision did not say when Season 1 will begin. For comparison, last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/" data-ref-id="1100-6527587">Black Ops 6 had its own Season 1 begin on November 14, 2024.</a> The game released on October 25, 2024, so Season 1 debuted 20 days after the game launched. If a similar timeframe follows for Black Ops 7, then Season 1 could start around early December, but nothing is confirmed at this stage.</p><p>All of the post-launch maps are free, but it's expected that Black Ops 7 will have its own in-game store filled with things people can buy with real money. We may not see as many outrageous and wacky skins, however, as Activision has said it might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">shifting focus away from those kinds of skins.</a> Black Ops 6's skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">won't carry forward to Black Ops 7, either. </a></p><p>Fans will get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">try Black Ops 7's multiplayer during a beta</a>, which begins on October 2 and continues through October 8.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-has-more-than-two-times-the-concurrent-players-on-steam-than-hades.1312747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the Great🖕) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>— Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Is there a word that describes the feeling of “I want something to be just a <em>bit</em> better because it’s already <em>so good</em> it only needs one last kick in the pants”?</p><p>Because that’s how I feel about the $60 Lego Nintendo Game Boy. It’s better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">the fan-made Lego Game Boy</a> that I asked Nintendo to make. It’s even better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display">I hoped when Lego officially revealed the set</a>. This isn’t just a statue that looks like my original 1989 Game Boy; it’s a joy to build and feels fantastic in the hands. You can press every button, spin every dial, roll the D-pad, and throw a satisfyingly snappy power switch.</p><p>Though it doesn’t light up one bit, its lenticular moving images were enough to momentarily surprise friends and family into asking: “Does it actually play games?” The set even has a few hidden Easter eggs.</p><p>And yet, I can’t help wanting more.</p><p>Let’s do something different for this review: Let’s make it a show and tell. If you’re a video person, start by tapping on my Instagram embed above, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/videos/lego-game-boy-vs-real-game-boy/1249944793488210/">or Facebook</a>, or perhaps <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanhollister.bsky.social/post/3lzr5x2okyc2q">my Bluesky</a>. If you prefer photos and words, scroll down and I’ll tell you all about it!</p><p>Here it is, the photograph I’ve wanted to stage for months: the Lego Nintendo Game Boy next to the pristine 1989 original you might have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/21/18508022/game-boy-nintendo-games-accessories-anniversary-photo-essay">in many a <em>Verge </em>photo before</a>. It was my wife’s childhood Game Boy, though I had one just like it — and Lego designer Carl Merriam absolutely nails the size, shape, and look. It does overcompensate slightly with the Off-On switch and headphone jack labels that are gray instead of molded, three of the four corners of the gray screen bezel are square instead of slightly rounded, and the A and B buttons seem almost pink rather than purple.</p><p>It’s also clearly made of a mosaic of Lego tiles rather than a single smooth surface, but that’s part of the charm: it’s a wonder to realize the Game Boy can be re-created 1:1 out of Lego bricks!</p><p>Here, I have both displaying the exact same cutscene from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>. If you’ve never played the original, you may not realize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwjewLrq8GM&amp;list=RDvwjewLrq8GM&amp;start_radio=1">just how specific a moment this is</a> — a bittersweet, heartstring-tugging scene you can only watch once per playthrough, so I had to save my game before a certain quest to get this photo.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Lenticular tech is still rad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Lego Game Boy comes with three of these little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing">lenticular panels</a> to make it look like the screen’s turned on and give it a sense of motion. If you tilt the handheld up and down, you can watch Mario jump, see the Nintendo logo fall, or watch the waves and seagulls fly above the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> beach.</p><p>But the one thing I don’t understand is printing on a <em>gray</em> background rather than a <em>green </em>one, so the Lego Game Boy’s screen doesn’t look green like the original’s. It feels like a bizarre miss to me.</p><p>A closer look at gray versus green:</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I threw in an Easter egg of my own.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s not the only nit I could pick with the Lego Game Boy’s screen, which is recessed quite a bit more than the original, which in turn makes it even harder to light up than the original (and, like the original, you need an external light source to do that since it didn’t have a light of its own!).</p><p>But I don’t blame Lego for that — it’s because Lego’s using a regular Lego window frame and windowpane for the screen instead of creating new custom parts, which make it feel more authentically Lego. I just wish Lego would start protecting its big windowpanes better so they don’t come scratched right out of the box.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You need a lot of light to see the “screen” well.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Comparing the Lego Game Boy to the original from every angle, you can see lots of places where there are slight gaps between the tiles, sure. But you can also see that almost every complex curve and label is represented, and while it weighs a few ounces less than the original, it’s almost the exact same size.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Image slider: volume and contrast wheels, external connector port (though there’s no port underneath Lego’s cover) and the AC adapter jack. No AC adapter label on the Lego version.</em></figcaption></p></div><div id=":R1abcmab96:"><p><figcaption><em>That power switch may seem placed too high, but it’s worth it for the satisfying snap of its Technic peg action.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You shouldn’t take that for granted, because it’s not easy even for skilled Lego creators to build a dense real-life object to scale with moving parts. As an example, see how much thicker and blockier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters"><em>Lego Masters Australia</em> finalist Nick Lever’s creation</a> is below?</p><div id=":R1ebcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>From left to right: Lego’s Game Boy, Nintendo’s Game Boy, and my attempt at Nick Lever’s fan creation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>I still love the Mario hat buttons, though.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>BTW, both of the Lego Game Boys can technically squeeze in a real cart, but it stretches the build uncomfortably.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23991049/lego-ideas-polaroid-onestep-behind-the-scenes-price">as the Lego Group showed and told me in 2023</a>, the thing that truly separates a great official Lego set from a fan creation is the incredible amount of thought that goes into making the set playable and fun to <em>build</em>, not just fun once you’re through.</p><p>You can get a better sense in my video, but after a certain point the whole set is built out of modular parts. You create a set of springy face buttons that slide into place, a D-pad that drops in, a screen that needs attaching. It contributes to the illusion you’re building electronics instead of just piling bricks together. And there are details you’ll only appreciate if you’ve seen inside — like how the springy Start and Select buttons are actually Lego car tires.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The rubber nub brick under the D-pad makes for a surprisingly good action.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Or how the springy “membrane” under the D-pad and A and B buttons are colored similarly to their real-life counterparts, even though you’ll never see them once it’s closed:</p><div id=":R1sbcmab96:"><p><figcaption><em>One rubber band makes both buttons springy.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Or how there’s a brick-built “speaker” underneath the Lego speaker grille, complete with yellow “wires,” at the lower right-corner of the build:</p><p>Or how Lego’s <em>Link’s Awakening </em>cartridge even features a “battery backup” for its save games, like the original, while the <em>Mario</em> cartridge appropriately does not.</p><div id=":R26bcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>Not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, since my real cart is the Player’s Choice reprint from 1996.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Lego cart can technically fit in an original Game Boy cartridge case if you remove the top tile.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>It all takes such passion and attention to detail that I have to wonder: why stop short of doing everything you can when you’ve already come this far?</p><p>Here’s the back of the Lego Game Boy, and the real Game Boy, showing off one final Easter egg: the “serial number” that’s actually the date the original Game Boy first came out on April 21st, 1989. That part’s great. But it also contains two completely blank spots where the original Game Boy had an info panel with model numbers and regulatory markings, and the US version had a service sticker.</p><p>At $60 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/786483/how-to-find-lego-game-boy-costco-sams-club-on-sale-early">I got mine early for $50 at Costco</a> — I can understand why the Lego Nintendo Game Boy doesn’t have light or sound or actually play games just yet. (Fans will make it do <em>all </em>those things before long.) But the top panel is already a printed piece, and the set already comes with a small sticker sheet.</p><p>Just like my real copy of <em>Link’s Awakening</em> fixes <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches_in_Link%27s_Awakening">bugs that Nintendo originally accidentally shipped</a>, might I suggest Lego ship future copies of the Game Boy with greener screens and a few more lines of text?</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/787849/lego-nintendo-game-boy-review]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios are cutting staff and closing their Liverpool, UK-based studio following Microsoft's cancellation of co-op smuggling game Contraband.
</p>
<p>Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">announced Contraband back in June 2021</a> in the form of a trailer replete with lockboxes, scribbly heist maps and Steely Dan music. There followed several years of almost complete silence, broken by news that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">over 500 Swedish staff had formed a union</a> in April 2024 - part of a wave of games industry labour activism in the face of widespread, "post-Covid" job-chopping.
</p>
<p>The positivity was not to last. In June 2024, Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-creators-avalanche-lay-off-50-people-and-close-their-montreal-and-new-york-studios">laid off 50 people and closed their New York and Montreal studios</a> to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company". Then, in August this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband">called time on Contraband</a>, shortly after laying off a bunch of Xbox developers and cancelling such games as Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">reboot of Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, Avalanche commented that "active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future". There's been some disagreement between Microsoft and reporters over whether the game is fully dead, or merely "on hold". I imagine it'll be on hold for a while, if they aren't any developers to work on it.
</p><p>Avalanche's <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement</a> about this week's reductions alludes to "current challenges to our business and the industry", but doesn't mention Contraband. The company propose to close their Liverpool studio, with a collective consultation process as required by UK law. "The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm," the statement continues, "where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>Insert joke about London calling here, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have just released the first of the mod's planned three DLC packs. This one's called Rabbit and Pork and brings with it 30 new quests, plus a laundry list of that includes a bunch of NPCs, extra gear, and stability fixes.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">covered the other day</a>, to dive into the DLC and have the least chance of running into any bugs that could be lurking, you'll want to start a fresh run through post-apoclayptic Blighty.</p>

<p>"This major update doesn't just add new content, it reshapes parts of the game based on your feedback and fixes thousands of issues identified since launch," Team FOLON wrote in the DLC's Discord announcement. "We've poured a huge amount of effort into making this the most polished and complete experience possible."</p><p>Rabbit and Pork brings 30 new quests and minigames to the mod, along with 80 new characters for which 8000+ lines of chat have been recorded, I assume at least a third of those being in Cockney accents. Taking a quick gander at the release trailer, among the things which've stuck out to me are a mission involving a plane named after Fallout: London's protagonist, the wayfarer, and a visit to the Jack the Ripper museum.</p>
<p>As you explore, 30 new weapons and armours can be found, along with a new animal follower and a home to move into. 70 fresh random encounters and "new content for early faction introductions" round out the additions, while Team FOLON say the number of bug fixes and stability improvements number in the thousands.</p>
<p>"We’re also unveiling a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">brand-new custom launcher</a> designed alongside the Overwolf team to simplify the installation process for those who wish to use it," they add. "This one-click solution will alleviate the hassle of traditional mod installations and get players into the game faster and more reliably than ever akin to the GOG one-click installer."</p>
<p>In addition, the modders have rolled a number of key <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mods that help make the game a bit less likely to crash into this release, so the High FPS Fix, X-Cell and Buffout 4 no longer have to be grabbed seperately. Team FOLON recommend you uninstall them if you've already downloaded and installed them individually, to avoid duplication.</p><p>To round out the news, the modders have also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamfolon/team-folon-collectors-edition">launched a Kickstarter</a> for a Collector's Edition of Fallout: London. Something to consider backing if you fancy it in between mouthfuls of rabbit and pork. If you bounced off of Fallout: London the first time around due to its launch bugs, here's the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">review I wrote of it</a> for my old home.</p>
