			<p>Time has gone very squiffy in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Set during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and following Zelda’s disappearance into a sinkhole beneath Hyrule Castle, Zelda awakens in a clearing in the forest. This isn’t her Hyrule though, and it soon becomes clear that she’s travelled back in time, all the way to Hyrule’s very beginning. There she meets King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the original founders and rulers of the iconic kingdom, and they take her in, lost as she is.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Imprisoning War begins November 6th – Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hVIiqYwp7PY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Breath of the Wild, the Legend of Zelda timeline has become deeper and more interconnected than before, and Age of Imprisonment is the next step in furthering the series’ lore and Hyrule’s history. It’s been interesting to see Hyrule Warriors becoming an integral part of Nintendo’s flagship series, and here that connection between the mainline entries and the spin-off are closer than ever.</p>


<p>Here in the past, you see the origins of Hyrule, and the initial union of the Zonai and Hyrulean people, while getting a different perspective on the Constructs and Zonai technology we first saw in Tears of the Kingdom, but there’s also further ties back to Breath of the Wild. At the start of the game, the realm is beset by Shades, and these lead to the construction of the shrines that come to litter the world, built to hold back these nightmarish shadows. It’s an interesting little bit of history for returning fans who have spent hundreds of hours in the shrines’ hidden depths.</p>
<p>With the arrival of Ganondorf, though, there’s a crushing sense of inevitability to the opening hours. Age of Imprisonment charts the war between Ganondorf the Demon King, and the rest of Hyrule, and the game spends a great deal of time bringing the different races together in preparation for the final showdown. In terms of character building, I don’t think I’ve ever truly hated the red-haired Gerudo leader as much as in Age of Imprisonment. He’s manipulative, deceitful, cunning and two-faced, and while he’s always ostensibly been these things, he feels like a true villain in Age of Imprisonment, rather than a faceless big bad, who’s evil because we’ve been told he is.</p>


<p>The large cast of characters, led by Zelda, are immediately fascinating, and you’ll undoubtedly enjoy spending time with them, particularly if you’re a longtime fan of the series, or even if you’re just coming to this straight from Tears of the Kingdom. The regal Zonai King Rauru, who is as powerful on the battlefield as he is in the throne room, swiftly became my favourite character, while his sister Lady Mineru brings a different flavour to combat, commanding Construct weaponry while riding around on a tiny chariot.</p>
<p>Zelda herself feels more settled and rounded than ever before, and her distant ancestors teach her a great deal about her own strength and the power that resides in her bloodline. On the battlefield she becomes capable of utterly ruining entire battalions, and she feels hugely powerful. No one can do it alone though, and one of the greatest joys of Imprisonment is switching between characters, exploiting enemy weaknesses, and teaming up for massive damage.</p>

<p>While Musou games are notoriously single minded, and fundamentally repetitive, the team at Koei’s team at AAA Games Studio have added as much to the formula as possible to keep boredom at bay. Elemental weaknesses are a great way to implement the different Zonai devices, and as you unlock dispensers on the map, you can slot them into your special skills, with the only limitation being your battery charge.</p>
<p>So, if you come up against water-based creatures, you’ll have more effect with ice or electricity, while being close to a body of water will amp up the effects even more. You can mix effects together, setting down fans and then combining them with fire or the other elements to create devastating tornados. It’s an organic and clever way to enhance combat, and does a good job of replacing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Age of Calamity’s</a> Sheikah Slate runes.</p>

<p>The only issue about this is that if you don’t have the devices slotted in – and that often means replacing a skill or two – then you’re hopping in and out of menus, pausing the action as you go. While that is also true for both its inspiration and its predecessor, it breaks the flow of combat to the point I ended up mostly relying on a single device and my character skills, rather than mixing the device effects together. It’s an option though, and some enemies will fall much quicker if you utilise them.</p>
<p>The Musou, 1v100 combat is as crunchy and enjoyable as it’s ever been, and as you increase your roster, they each introduce unique mechanics into the mix. You can’t help but smile at being able to play as Korok Calamo, decimating armies with a tiny leaf chap, whose ultimate attack involves throwing a beehive at the bad guys. Other characters introduce perfect parry techniques into the mix as well, and combat is at its best as you move back and forth, utilising each character’s different techniques, and watching the kill count stack ever higher.</p>

<p>The only real downside at this point is that very little of Age of Imprisonment feels wholly new. The narrative is well told, the visuals excellent – performance is also mostly very stable on Switch 2, though one Rito character’s moveset seems to stress the engine more than everybody else – and there’s been a lot done to further amalgamate the Musuo fundamentals with Tears of the Kingdom, but there is a sense of familiarity which lurks around every corner that you bump into yet another Moblin. That familiarity is mostly staved off by the steady feed of new moves, characters, weapons and ingredients, but after Age of Imprisonment, I feel as though the Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom arc is now done.</p>

<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 1 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160023/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2014 when I picked up the very first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/hyrule_warriors">Hyrule Warriors</a> on Wii U, my expectations were set somewhere around 'Give me mindless musou action wearing its best Legend of Zelda costume and I'll be a very happy boy.' A simple boy, for sure, but a happy one.</p>
<p>And I was a happy boy. I played through Hyrule Warriors in a delirious blaze over a weekend (I had just become a dad for the first time, so my son spent some of his earliest days on earth watching his auld pa tear Moblin armies a new ar...mour hole), therefore this is a spin-off series that's got a special place in my heart; it gives me my musou fix, it rocks Zelda vibes immaculately, and it provided me with a nice family memory. Hooray!</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, tightened things up on the battlefield and ensured the story played a more integral role. Some people still prefer Hyrule Warriors, as it's got more content, and I'd usually be on that boat with a game of this type. I mean, how deep can it get? I want to smash people, not fall asleep during cutscenes.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 2 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160014/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The thing is, though, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda</a> series is on such a massive high right now, certainly in terms of its lore, and so I want the narrative in my balls-to-the-wall action game. I want the plot, the drama, the surprises, the cameos, the deep lore references. And since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is 100% bona fide canon material, that's exactly what they've delivered for this latest slice of Hylian...eh...hellaciousness?</p>
<p>Age of Imprisonment rolls with Calamity's clever refocusing to deliver a game that balances best-in-class musou combat with a story that will have Zelda fans locked in. I won't spoil any of it, but any niggles folk had with Age of Calamity's ending shouldn't cause any stress this time.</p>
<p>Nor do you need to stress the game's performance or graphical prowess. Age of Imprisonment is a showcase for your shiny Switch 2. Yes, even in co-op mode. We've finally broken free from the prison of sketchy frame rates and blurry resolutions! <em>*Does Moblin victory dance*</em></p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 3 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160012/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In main campaign mode, we're looking at smooth 60fps action, and whilst I'm no Digital Foundry boffin, I can't say I noticed a drop anywhere. For co-op play, 30fps is the target and it feels super-smooth, even if it is a step down switching from 60.</p>
<p>Now, let's rewind a bit to where Age of Imprisonment picks up the action within the overall franchise framework, as I got a bit excited to tell you about performance. This latest effort takes place right back at the kingdom of Hyrule's formation. Princess Zelda has accidentally travelled back in time using a secret stone and is thrown into the mix during the Imprisonment Wars, which every self-respecting Zelda fan has studied exhaustively.</p>
<p>Given that the story has got the full and official blessing of the lords of Hyrule, and is therefore 100% Pure Canon™, the devs have taken advantage and given us an adventure that consistently wows in its diligent attention to detail. Again, I am at pains to spoil nothing, but if you're into taking an action-packed and informative tour of Hyrule's past, one that happens to invite you to a blistering square-off against Ganondorf and his filthy armies, then prepare to have a very good time indeed.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 4 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Old familiar places and faces abound, and the story that evolves around them is an exciting and satisfying one; one that lives up to the rich — and heavily scrutinised — universe of which it's now a part.</p>
<p>This attention to detail pans out across the game's menus and UI, flawless copies of those found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, and extends to the in-game map, split into distinct regions that need to be wrestled back from the clutches of Ganondorf's freshly-formed armies.</p>
<p>As it goes on, this map gets super-cluttered with quests, aside missions, and challenges, and Age of Imprisonment pulls off another nice balancing act here. Story missions are meaty affairs, and they give you all the pomp, ceremony, and production values you expect from a mainline Zelda. This is the main meat, and it's powered by top-notch combat melded with a genuinely great story.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 5 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then you get to liberate yourself with uncomplicated beatdowns. You know, the stuff musou fans turn up for: challenging fights against hordes of baddies on repeat until we whittle our times down and kill everything in sight without taking a hit.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo's new team, AAA Games Studio, has also cleverly leveraged aspects of the Zelda games to create the illusion of a much grander adventure. The cooking is here, and it works into camps that keep your team going during long quests. The Zonai device dispensers are also here, ready to have parts pumped into them in return for traps for use in battle. It all adds up to something that <em>feels</em> epic, even though, at its heart, it's still just running around in circles, battering wee guys like you were doing years ago in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dynasty_warriors_8_empires">Dynasty Warriors</a> (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a>, another recent stunner from KT's musou maestros, Omega Force).</p>

<p>So, we're in excellent shape so far in terms of presentation, then, and you can go ahead and add stellar voice-acting in the English dub and an excellent soundtrack to the mix. It's top-notch stuff across the board. Heck, you can even play tracks at your leisure in a music player in the menus.</p>
<p>With combat, we're building on a concept that Koei Tecmo's teams have got down pat at this point. I considered Age of Calamity the best Musou game I'd played back in 2020, in terms of just how much depth and polish it added to the overall fighting package without spoiling the fun for folk who want mindless railing against huge crowds of dumb enemies. This game does all of that, and more besides.</p>
<p>This is musou that aims higher than simply button-mashing. Shielded foes require consideration, bosses can be tough, and your roster of heroes can pull off specific moves to counter aerial assaults or heavily defended units, so there's a 'right' way to do things for maximum stylishness. You also now have Sync Strikes to add to an already heady mix.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 7 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160018/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sync Strikes become available as a gauge fills by attacking and fighting well, and once your chosen character's gauge is flashing blue, you just need to get into position (nearby an ally) and hit 'L' to join forces for a fancy smackdown. It's very addictive, there are different strikes for different character pairings, and it fits in perfectly without ruining that magical musou flavour.</p>
<p>These new Sync Strikes also introduce a fresh flow to the core of the game that gives it a strategic lift. In Age of Calamity, or at least how I played it, my units would be split up and taking over points alone a lot of the time. Now, however, you need to consider whether or not to keep allies nearby for when you need a Sync Strike.</p>
<p>There are countless moments along the way, as you slice and dice across some amazingly detailed depictions of Hyrule's famous landmarks in their infancy, where the sheer number of Moblins, Constructs, and Gorons onscreen is incredibly impressive. I'm sure these are the biggest crowds I've cut through in a game, and boy oh boy, with that smooth frame rate, it feels glorious to twirl and whirl through the lot of them. They're also incredibly well-animated and detailed.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 8 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160015/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those Zonai devices I briefly mentioned are another well-handled aspect of the fun, with all characters able to share in the action once a device has been unlocked. Rather than bringing up your Sheikah Slate with the 'R' button, you now bring up a menu of character-specific attacks and Zonai device slots. These can even be freely swapped out during scraps. So, Zelda has her light sword and bow attacks, her signature moves, and she can then swap in a bunch of Zonai tech to aid her.</p>
<p>Further to this (yes, there's more), Zonai tech can eventually be slotted to the ends of combos, so you can throw out a bunch of light hits, then press 'X' to switch into heavy flow-ups that end with a Zonai device attack.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's all so complex on paper, and just to <em>think</em> about, really, but as soon as Mineru shows up early in the campaign, once you get a shot at how this stuff works, you'll want to use it all the time. Hey! That's how I felt about the building and crafting in Tears of the Kingdom, too, so I guess they really have nailed the vibe.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 9 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160016/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can drop stuff into the environment, as well, like a time bomb or a flame emitter, to get a little extra clever. Why smash someone with your sword alone when you could be smashing them while they are set alight and moving in slow motion? I have to say, too, that while some parts of Age of Calamity felt cumbersome when they gave you large machines to pilot, here any new means of locomotion (and there's plenty this time out) handle much better.</p>
<p>On a negative note, as nice as the levels look across the board, and as amazing as it is to have The Depths in the mix — <em>and</em> to see so many franchise landmarks from a new perspective — the maps are essentially the same old straightforward boxes to run around in. There's no real effort to deviate from the usual structure of corridors and wide open spaces.</p>
<p>Whilst the overall look of everything — from the world map presented on a Purah Pad to the vistas you'll pass by as you scrap — is perfect, the ebb and flow of charging from one scrap to the next is still as basic and repetitive as it ever was beneath the fancy set-dressing.</p>
<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Review - Screenshot 10 of 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160011/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Map design niggles aside, though, it really is hard to find fault otherwise. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment gives us a canonical prequel packed to the rafters with slick action, some great story stuff for the fans, and surprises, cameos, and fun around every corner. Once the campaign is done, there's lots to dig into, too, and the devs ensure plenty of replayability thanks to built-in achievements and harder difficulties that really up the ante and force you to play more cleverly.</p>
<p>I won't/can't go into the Mysterious Construct character and their Korok pal (even though they are easily the coolest part of the trailers) - you're just gonna have to find out for yourself. I also won't/can't go into any spoilers on the roster. What I will say is that you won't be disappointed. The whole thing absolutely belongs, and feels as though it belongs, in terms of its polish and presentation, as part of the series proper.</p>
<p>Considering the series in question is one of the greatest of all time, that's quite the accomplishment. The best musou game out of Koei Tecmo thus far, then? You betcha.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a stunning slice of action, and my favourite musou game so far. Lessons have been learned from both Hyrule Warriors and Age of Calamity, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it.</p>
<p>With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date.</p></section>

			<p>Hyrule Warriors has grown from a spinoff to a full-fledged series in its own right relatively quickly, with the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> being the third Zelda-themed Musou game to arrive in roughly a decade. Age of Imprisonment once again serves up a hearty helping of Dynasty-Warriors-style hack ‘n’ slash action while promising to fill in some key details of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>’s backstory.</p>



<p>Is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment a smashing good time? Or can you safely pass on this particular prequel? Time to wade into the fray.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The previous entry in this series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>, also made lofty promises about filling in the backstory of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with some fans ultimately feeling disappointed when it turned out the game was really more of a reality-hopping multiverse tale than a simple prequel. Thankfully, those looking for a story that builds on The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in a more straightforward way will find Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment a much more traditional prequel. No alternate timeline shenanigans here.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The events of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment are set in motion when Zelda is sent hurtling back in time at the beginning of Tears of the Kingdom. Our time-displaced princess is soon discovered by Rauru and Sonia, the ancient King and Queen of Hyrule, who kindly take Zelda in while she tries to figure out this whole time travel thing. At the same time, our old friend Ganondorf is plotting, and while Zelda warns about the danger he’ll become, Rauru’s ego convinces him he can contain the villain, which results in (SPOILERS for something already revealed in Tears of the Kingdom) the loss of both Rauru’s kingdom and his wife.</p>



<p>While this is happening, we also meet a pair of new characters: a Mysterious Construct who bears a striking resemblance to Link and his Korok sidekick, Calamo. As these things tend to go, an evil mirror construct brought to life by Ganondorf’s power has also been set loose on the world. While this Mystery Construct clearly serves the functional purpose of adding a Link-like fighter to a game without messing up the timeline, Age of Imprisonment actually manages to build some sense of mystery and drama surrounding this construct, and while I won't spoil it, the hows and whys of his existence actually make a decent amount of sense.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following this initial setup, we see Rauru, Zelda, and their allies, and the Mysterious Construct, Calamo, and their allies, battle Ganondorf’s forces on various fronts, both separately and together. This story is well-told through often meaty cutscenes, which don't shy away from the character-driven emotional beats that Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom largely avoided. Characters really only presented as archetypes in previous Zelda games are properly fleshed out here — I was particularly happy to see Ganondorf actually getting a legitimate turn as a villain in this game after being reduced to a vaguely-defined evil force in Breath of the Wild and spending most of his time hiding in a hole in Tears of the Kingdom. This all builds to one of the most satisfying finales to a Zelda game in quite some time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for what happens between the cutscenes, those who played Age of Calamity, or really any of Koei Tecmo’s Warriors games (also referred to as “Musou” games by fans), will know what to expect here in broad terms. This is yet another Warriors-style hack ‘n’ slash with players mowing through literally thousands of Moblins, Lizalfos, and other pawns, as well as more challenging minibosses and bosses. That said, while Age of Imprisonment generally sticks to the Musou blueprint, some tweaks have been made to set this game apart.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As in all Warriors games, players can pull off combos using the Y and X buttons, but this time around each character also gains access to various Unique Skills, which can be triggered instantly by pressing the R button in conjunction with one of the face buttons. Typically, each characters Uniques include anti-air, anti-rush, and shield-breaker attacks, which lends the game an additional small measure of strategy.</p>



<p>Players can also now wield a variety of Zonai devices, many of which inflict some sort of elemental damage (fire, ice, electricity, etc.) which can be used to counteract enemies of the opposing type. Once unlocked, Zonai devices can be shared between multiple characters and their effects can interact with each other and other attacks, with, say, electricity and wind combining to create a lightning-charged cyclone. While you don't actually need to get too fancy with Zonai devices to win most battles, there are some interesting synergies that can be created with them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ultimately, though, teamwork is the core focus of Age of Imprisonment’s combat. Past systems, like the Rune abilities from Age of Calamity, have been cut, with the new big moves that can change the course of a battle being Sync Strikes which see you and your teammates combine forces to unleash powerful and distinctive attacks. Sync Strikes are flashy and fun, and it’s really quite impressive that there are individual combo attacks for nearly every character combination in the game, considering the roster is nearly 30 fighters strong.</p>



<p>Beyond the Sync Strikes, Age of Imprisonment just generally encourages frequent character switching. Unique Skills are on a cooldown timer, so it's often a good idea to switch characters on the fly if they happen to have, for instance, a needed anti-air attack ready to go (you also get big bonus damage if you change to another character at key moments). Of course, all of this can be done with a friend via local co-op with GameShare, allowing someone to join in on a second Switch (or even an original Switch), even if they don't own the game. While my ability to test out co-op was limited, performance felt much more consistent than Age of Calamity on Switch 1.</p>

<p>Age of Imprisonment is an across-the-board technical step up from Age of Calamity, which often felt like it was pushing the Switch 1 to its breaking point (and beyond). While Age of Imprisonment isn’t always a looker from an artistic standpoint, it pushes <em>a lot</em> of stuff on screen (much more than Age of Calamity at its peak) and does so at a mostly-smooth 60fps, only faltering occasionally during particularly crowded, effects-laden battles. More aesthetically pleasing are the game’s many prerendered cutscenes (story bits regularly run for 10 minutes or more at a time), which are well-directed and appropriately flashy, although as best as I can tell, they seem to run at only 30fps, something that sticks out when they appear alongside 60fps gameplay.</p>



<p>So, Age of Imprisonment’s combat feels and looks nice, which is a good thing, because you’re not going to derive much excitement from the game’s level design. If anything, things have been simplified this time around, with some of the basic exploration and puzzle elements found in Age of Calamity now gone. Most stages are just a series of narrow corridors connecting battle arenas together and mission design follows a very predictable formula -- smash enemies to free bases, set up camp there to heal your party, then move on until you face some sort of boss.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Granted, said bosses can pose a fairly solid challenge and, much to my surprise, Age of Imprisonment also throws in some Star-Fox-style on-rails shooting segments that see the Mysterious Construct transform into a magic-powered jet to take down enemies. So, there is some variety here, but there's no denying that the game can feel somewhat one-dimensional at times. While I never had a bad time playing Age of Imprisonment, it was usually the story that was compelling me onward, rather than the gameplay.</p>

<p>But hey, if you enjoy smashing things, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment serves up a hell of a lot of things to smash. While the core campaign is perhaps a bit short by Warriors' standards, lasting around 12 to 15 hours, there's <em>a lot</em> of extra stuff to do (the mission selection map is littered with enough icons to make Ubisoft blush). Those looking to fit it all in may find themselves wishing for time travel powers of their own.</p>

				<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment does a lot to address the story and technical shortcomings that held back its predecessors while making some modest yet welcome tweaks to the series’ combat. Age of Imprisonment remains relatively shallow compared to core Zelda games, but that’s largely inherent to the Musou genre, and those happy to bliss out while bashing Bokoblins will find a well-told tale worth tussling with long term.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages always seem to happen at the worst time—during a winter storm when you need your heat, in the middle of cooking dinner, or right when you’re on an important video call. The problem is solved with gas generators but includes exhaust fumes, constant noise, and the hassle of storing fuel. Portable power stations give you clean backup power without the headaches, and the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic just dropped to $399 from $599 on Amazon</a>. This thing pumps out <strong>1800W with a 1024Wh LiFePO4 battery that lasts over a decade</strong>, charges from empty to 80% in 45 minutes, and kicks in automatically in under 10 milliseconds when the grid goes down. You’re basically getting backup power that costs less than a decent budget gas generator but works indoors, runs silently and doesn’t require you to drag out gas cans every time the lights flicker.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Power for the Devices You Need</h2>
<p>The 1800W continuous output handles most household essentials. Your refrigerator keeps running during an outage so you don’t lose a freezer full of food; your space heater keeps one room comfortable when the furnace goes down, and you can make coffee with an electric kettle or run a microwave to warm up meals. The 3600W surge capacity covers those brief power spikes when devices first turn on, like when your fridge compressor kicks in or you fire up a power tool. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology even pushes the system up to 2600W for heavier loads and opens possibilities for running larger appliances that might trip smaller power stations.</p>
<p>That 1024Wh capacity translates into very real-world runtime that actually matters: You can run a modern refrigerator for about 12 hours, keep a laptop charged through multiple work sessions, power LED lights for days, or run a CPAP machine through several nights of sleep. Winter camping or RV trips become way more comfortable when you can run an electric blanket, charge multiple devices and still have power left for morning coffee.</p>



<p>X-Stream fast charging fills the battery from 0 to 80% in just 45 minutes, meaning you are not waiting all day for it to be ready. Most portable power stations take four to six hours to reach a full charge, so shaving that time down makes a huge difference when you need backup power in a hurry. The UPS function-all under 10 milliseconds-switches automatically to battery power the instant it detects an outage to protect computers, routers, medical equipment, or anything else that can’t handle sudden power loss.</p>



<p>The battery chemistry LiFePO4 lasts more than 10 years with daily use, which is in another league compared to the cheaper lithium batteries that degrade after a couple of years. EcoFlow uses the same EV-grade battery design utilized in electric cars, and a smart Battery Management System prevents overcharging, overheating, and other issues that prematurely kill batteries. You invest in something that works reliably year after year instead of replacing it every few seasons. The system remains safe at extreme temperatures, handles the stress of frequent charging cycles, and maintains consistent power output even while aging.</p>
<p>At $399, you’re getting emergency backup power, camping comfort, and energy independence for less than most people spend on a basic gas generator that sits in the garage leaking fumes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-fallout-live-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-like-mmo-%E2%80%98pioner%E2%80%99-launches-open-beta-on-steam.1343116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER is an ambitious, post-apocalyptic MMO FPS that fuses PvE and PvP mechanics, crafting, and customization to bring players a memorable experience that’s just a <strong>bit </strong>reminiscent of other games. It has been compared to a combination of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout in the past, and it’s easy to see why.</p>



<p>In PIONER, players contend with a grim, desolate world teeming with threats, all while exploring an immersive story that promises to offer stacks of opportunities to dig into the game’s ecosystem. The developer, GFA Games, has just announced that PIONER’s open beta is available now, exclusively on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-s-open-beta-is-live-now">PIONER’s Open Beta is Live Now</h2>



<p>If you want to sample all the dark, destructive things that PIONER has to offer, you’ll want to jump in now and explore the open beta, available on Steam until November 11.</p>



<p>In a press release, the team at GFA Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players can now explore the dangerous and mysterious Tartarus Island and experience the game for free ahead of its full release, planned for late 2025. This is the next step in the ongoing development of this highly anticipated title, following a series of successful closed beta tests to which selected players have been invited over the past few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GFA Games is a Serbian studio made up of developers who formerly worked on games like STALKER and Atomic Heart.</p>



<p>PIONER’s open beta will offer around 30 hours of content, including the first five acts of the story campaign, which will give players the lay of the land when it comes to factions, points of interest, and more. There’s a hefty PvE raid available, as well as a PvP deathmatch portion for the players who want an added challenge.</p>



<p>Players can explore three huge missions, taking on a world boss and getting a taste of the full scope of PIONER.</p>



<p>PIONER is set to be released later this year, but doesn’t have a confirmed date at present. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">coming to Steam</a> first, but GFA Games has promised that console versions are coming later.</p>

                <p>A new study has revealed its findings on the carbon footprint of physical video games, and unsurprisingly, digitally downloaded games are considered to be more environmentally friendly in comparison to physical. French carbon-accounting firm Greenly studied the environmental impact of various systems and the production of video games, finding that physical copies of games are "100 times more carbon-intensive" than their digital counterparts.</p><p>According to Greenly, the manufacturing and transportation of physical games--with 1 million discs being used as an example--could produce 312 tons of carbon dioxide, while 1 million downloads of the same game--if it were 70GB in size--would equal three tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>"Although cloud-based gaming can be detrimental as a result of its need for continuous access to energy-hungry data servers, we also cannot neglect the continued impact of manufacturing and packaging physical video games," study author Stephanie Safdie explained to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/manufacture-and-shipping-of-physical-games-is-100-times-more-carbon-intensive-than-digital-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Ultimately, downloading a digital copy imposes emissions linked to electricity use at home, as well as the energy use of the concerned data center--but it does not have the same impact as the emissions created by the industry in terms of landfill and excessive waste, which are primarily still accounted for by physical consoles and hard disc copies of games."</p><p>Ultimately, the production of a physical game disc involves the extraction of rare earth metals and the production of plastic, which in turn requires the usage of machines, processes, and labor that contribute to the drain on resources. This includes the manufacturing of consoles, with Greenly estimating that these devices consume 3.9 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year in the US and are responsible for the production of 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent). Factor in television sets also running on electricity, and the ultimate impact of gaming across traditional consoles, mobile devices, and cloud gaming is significant.</p><p>So what's an environmentally conscious gamer supposed to do? Greenly found that handheld systems produce far fewer emissions--13.8kg CO2e per year with the Switch, for example--and the firm also suggested that companies look at methods to reduce their overall energy consumption.</p><p>This has been an area where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-energy-saving-graphics-modes-reportedly-being-explored-by-microsoft/1100-6508943/">Microsoft has been heavily focused</a> with its use of recycled materials and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-consoles-can-now-download-updates-in-energy-saver-mode/1100-6501492/">energy-saving power modes</a>.</p>

            <p>Auroch Digital has just announced Warhammer Survivors, a new Rogue-Like Survivors game created with the blessing of both Warhammer and Poncle (Vampire Survivors). It's set to release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The game, much like Vampire Survivors, will feature endless hordes of Warhammer enemies, which you must take down with a variety of weapons and playable characters. You'll be able to choose between the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40k, or the fantastical Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, each with their own unlocks to pursue.</p>
<p>40K characters revealed include Malum Caedo from another beloved Auroch Digital Warhammer game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>. There's also Cadian soldier Trooper Kozlowski, as well as Space Marine Intercessor Brother Luca. Warhammer: Age of Sigmar fans can look forward to playing Neave Blacktalon, Gotrek Gurnisson, and Sharynn Azurwrath.</p>

<p>There are some fun Easter eggs in there too for Warhammer fans, including Nuln Oil paint (a trusty Warhammer shade paint handy for pretty much everything) which will seemingly be an item you can use to fend off encroaching enemies. There's apparently going to be a vast roster of similar treats for fans of the franchise, so keep an eye out.</p><p>The game is available on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669620/Warhammer_Survivors/">and can be wishlisted now</a>. There's no word on when exactly in 2026 it'll be released, but more announcements regarding Warhammer Survivors are on the way, so it's certainly worth keeping tabs on in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following a successful final beta event, Embark's ARC Raiders launched to excellent initial figures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easily surpassing the concurrent user peak reached by the studio's previous game</a>, The Finals, which is even more impressive given that the latter is a free-to-play game, whereas the former is not.</p>



<p>This past weekend, the third-person PvPvE extraction shooter even surpassed that peak, settling around 354K concurrent players two days ago, an absolutely respectable figure that currently places the game at the 38th spot in Steam's all-time chart.</p>



<p>What really matters to game developers is sales, though, and there's good news on that front, too. According to estimates based on SteamDB data, ARC Raiders might have already sold between 1.6 million units (as estimated by <a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamalytic</a>) and 1.9 million units (as tracked by <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/1808500?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VG Insights</a> and <a href="https://playtracker.net/insight/game/119059?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayTracker</a>). Considering that the game is also available on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, it's not inconceivable that it might have sold close to three million units by now in total. Sure, the $40 budget price helps, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many shooter fans had already spent $70 on Battlefield 6 a couple of weeks ago</a>, and yet they deemed it worth spending more money on this one as well.</p>



<p>While we wait for official sales figures from Embark, the studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the post-launch roadmap for ARC Raiders. Later this month, players can look forward to a new map called Stella Montis, new Quests and gameplay items, new Arc machines (Matriarch and Shredder), and a community unlock event. In December, the developers will introduce more Quests, a new Raider deck, the Snowfall map condition, an event titled 'Flickering Flames', and the Expedition departure window. Other ongoing improvements without a specific timeframe include new feats and trials, more map conditions, cosmetics, and quality of life updates.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has announced that its brand new console, the Switch 2, has now sold over 10 million units in the first four months on sale. That makes it the most successful console launch ever by quite some margin. And the two flagship games,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, each have their own extraordinary figures to boast of.</p> <p>The Switch 2, launched June 5 after a peculiar and obfuscated build-up, went on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">sell an extraordinary 3.5 million units</a> in just its first four days on sale. Now, obviously that number includes <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-walmart-target-best-buy-nintendo-1851777604">pre-orders that built up rather chaotically from April</a>, on top of post-launch sales in the opening days, so it was always going to be the most dramatic number. At the start of August, Nintendo revealed things were still going extremely well, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194">a total of six million Switch 2s sold in its first month</a>. While numbers from rival console manufacturers are often more hazy, this fully confirms the hybrid gaming device as the most successful console launch ever, dwarfing the already impressive numbers of the original Switch, and beating the PS5 to 10 million sales by a full four months. Which is to say, the Switch 2 has sold twice as fast as Sony’s behemoth.</p>

 <p>Come <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf">the latest financial filings from Nintendo</a>, noting sales up to the end of September, the company reports that by September 30 it had sold a total of 10.36 million Switch 2s. Which is astonishing.</p> <p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> has nearly doubled its sales since its first month, with a total of 9.57 million copies sold (and that’s actually <em>sold</em>, rather than just shipped), while July 17’s <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has shifted 3.49 million carts.</p>

 <p>All these massive numbers have given Nintendo cause to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_2e.pdf">increase its sales expectations for the end of the financial year</a>. It was originally banking on 15 million Switch 2s sold by the spring, but that hope has now been raised to 19 million. Even this may still be a cautious under-estimation, given we’re just now entering the holiday season—a time period most rival consoles deliberately launch directly into. On top of that, the Switch 2 has already sold for two more months after these reported numbers, and with <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stock-holiday-price-tariff-2000636565">Nintendo’s plan to flood the stores with stock for Christmas</a>, “only” another 8.5 million units by March 2026 could easily be reached.</p> <p>Nintendo also announced that it has sold 1.89 million more original Switches in the same time period, and made a mind-blowing 61.56 million software sales across those six months. The Switch 2, with its far smaller user-base, still sold 20.62 million games, although as you will note, three fifths of that is made up of two games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Clears Out This 20,000mAh 87W 3-Port Power Bank, Now Selling for Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-this-20000mah-87w-3-port-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies-2000641031</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-this-20-000mah-87w-3-port-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1343083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You know that sinking feeling when your phone hits 10% battery and you’re nowhere near an outlet? Or when you’re at the airport and every charging station is packed with people camping around power strips? A good power bank solves that problem but most of them either charge too slowly, run out of juice after one phone charge, or force you to carry a bunch of cables.</p>
<p>Anker just dropped the price on their <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/">20,000mAh power bank with a built-in USB-C cable down to $44 from the usual $69 on Amazon</a>. This thing <strong>pushes 87W across three devices at once</strong> and can charge a MacBook Pro to 50% in under 40 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5324/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Day</h2>
<p>That 20,000mAh capacity gives you <strong>multiple full charges for your phone</strong> or enough juice to top up a laptop when you’re working remotely and can’t find a seat near an outlet. In real terms, that’s four charges for an iPhone 17 or enough to fully charge your MacBook Air and still have juice for your phone and earbuds. The <strong>battery pack itself recharges in just 1.5 hours</strong> when you plug it into a 65W charger which means you’re not waiting around all night for it to be ready the next morning.</p>



<p>That all changes with <strong>its built-in USB-C cable</strong>: You won’t be rummaging around in your bag for the correct cable or realize it was still lying on your desk at home. Simply pull out the power bank, unwind the cable and plug in your device-done. It charges an iPhone 17 Pro to 58% in 30 minutes, or a MacBook Air to 52% over the same time, which is fast enough to get you through the rest of your workday or a particularly long flight.</p>



<p>The <strong>87W total output splits across three ports&nbsp;with a single device maxing out at 65W</strong>. That means you can fast-charge your laptop through the USB-C port while your phone and wireless earbuds charge from the other two ports at the same time. The setup works for anything: iPhones, Samsung phones, iPads, Nintendo Switch, or any USB-C device you’re carrying around.</p>
<p>Anker designed <strong>this power bank to meet airline regulations</strong> so you can toss it in your carry-on without any drama at security. The 20,000mAh capacity sits right at the limit most airlines allow and gives you maximum power without crossing into the restricted zone.</p>
<p>For $44, you’re getting a power bank that actually covers the situations where you really do need backup power: long travel days, outdoor events, working from coffee shops, or just the peace of mind that your devices won’t die when you need them most. The<strong> 18-month warranty supports it</strong>&nbsp;so if anything goes wrong, you are covered.</p>

              <p>The release calendar is finally dying down a bit, but only just barely. November means it’s officially <em>Call of Duty</em> season, but there are tons of games coming out this month that aren’t called <em>Black Ops 7</em>. Switch 2 exclusives (<em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>), neat indie RPGs (<em>Demonschool</em>), and overdue PS5 ports (<em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>) abound.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops with serious power usually carry a price tag equal to a small fortune. You know how it goes: you look at the specs you actually need, check the price, and immediately start compromising. Maybe you don’t really need that much storage, right? Well, HP just threw an early Black Friday sale on Amazon that changes the game completely. This <strong>17.3-inch laptop comes with 64GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor</strong>-basically the kind of setup that normally runs close to $4,000. The good new is that right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/">it’s sitting at $1,199 after a 70% discount</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>17.3-inch touchscreen gives you breathing room</strong> that smaller laptops just can’t match: If you have ever tried to work on a 13-inch screen and felt you were playing Tetris with your windows, you will appreciate the reason size matters in this respect. The HD+ anti-glare panel means you can set up near a window without spending half your day adjusting the angle of the screen so that you can actually see what you’re doing. The touchscreen aspect really does speed things up when scrolling through long documents or just generally navigating about<strong> Windows 11 Pro</strong>.</p>
<h2>Specs That Matter in Real Life</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7430U processor <strong>runs 6 cores and 12 threads and hits speeds up to 4.3GHz</strong> when you need it. In plain English, this means you can video call your team while updating a presentation with Slack pinging in the background and your music playing without your laptop freezing up or fans screaming like a jet engine. The integrated Radeon Graphics handle streaming and everyday visual tasks without breaking a sweat. It’s not a gaming rig, but it covers everything most people actually do on their computers day in and day out.</p>



<p>But here’s where it gets interesting: 64GB of RAM is absurd for most laptops and that is precisely why it’s so great. Most computers ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you into this constant dance of closing programs to free up memory. With 64GB, you just stop thinking about it: Keep your email open all week, run that resource-hungry video editing software, open 50 browser tabs for your research project and the laptop just handles it.</p>
<p>The 4TB SSD storage means you are done with that “delete old files to install new programs” routine. Your whole photo collection from the last decade, work projects, personal files, software and backups can all live on one drive. And SSDs load everything faster than old hard drives so your programs open in seconds instead of you watching that spinning wheel for what feels like forever.</p>



<p>In Windows 11 Pro, there is Microsoft Copilot, the AI tool that helps draft emails, summarize long documents, or even brainstorm ideas when you’re stuck. Built-in AI image features let you edit photos without downloading extra software. Windows Hello logs you in via facial recognition which means no more typing passwords every time you open your laptop.</p>
<p>At $1,199 for this configuration, you’re getting a laptop that doesn’t force you to choose between the features you want versus the ones you can afford.</p>

Squires, who only became director of the USPTO in September, has personally ordered a reexamination after he "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" to certain claims made by the patent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Squires' description of the claims in question:</p><blockquote>"The '397 patent issued with claims drawn to controlling the movement of a player character in a field of a virtual space, causing a sub character to appear in the field, controlling a battle in a manual mode when an enemy character is present in the location the sub character has appeared, and when an enemy character is not present in the location the sub character has appeared, automatically moving the sub character, and controlling a battle in an automatic mode when an enemy character is placed at a designated location."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In his order, Squires pointed to two older U.S. patent applications — one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo itself in 2019 — as “prior art” references. Both, Squires said, would be “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” and each “raises a substantial new question of patentability.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mueller, writing for Games Fray, said Squires' order was down to the “public outrage” at the award of the patent, and concerns about the reputation of the U.S. patent system as a whole. While this reexamination isn’t a revocation order, Mueller insisted it is now “highly likely” that the USPTO will revoke Nintendo’s ‘397 patent. Nintendo has two months to respond.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile legal battle with Pocketpair over Palworld? Mueller said it “further undermines the credibility” of Nintendo’s patent assertions against Pocketpair's game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the latest legal blow for Nintendo in its battle against Palworld. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit">one of the Nintendo patents related to its monster capture patents filed last year</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"> was rejected by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) for lacking originality</a>. The office’s reasoning for the rejection made reference to older games with similar mechanics that were released even before 2021, including ARK (released in 2015), Monster Hunter 4 (2013), and Japanese browser game Kantai Collection (also 2013). Ironically, Pocketpair’s Craftopia (2020) and Niantic’s Pokémon Go (2016) were among other examples of games that were used to argue that the patent lacks originality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three main patents</u></a> granted by the JPO: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. The case has rumbled on, with Nintendo even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why?_gl=1*9gbndy*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTEzNjgzNTkxNi4xNzYxODIzODEz*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjE4MjM4MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjE4MjM4MTQkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>rewriting a mount-related patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, and arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2174642895-1762250885224.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pocketpair is soldiering on with Palworld development despite the Nintendo lawsuit.

Mueller said there may not be any further developments this calendar year relating to Nintendo’s lawsuit against Pocketpair or patents that are related to it. But decisions are expected next year. All eyes will be on Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. “It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose,” Mueller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed"><u>former Capcom game developer Yoshiki Okamoto issued comments seemingly against Pocketpair and Palworld in the legal battle</u></a>, sparking a backlash from viewers. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZIhdKKNRnI0?si=rTqnRy6Ngo_oolxe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube video</u></a> posted on his channel on September 27, Okamoto said Palworld had "crossed a line that should not be crossed, and I don't want the world to become a place where this kind of thing is acceptable."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It now expects to shift 19 million units of its new console before the end of March 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Switch 2's success into perspective, Nintendo has doubled the launch sales of Switch 1 (which sold 4.7 million units in its first six months back in 2017) and is also well ahead of the PlayStation 5's own impressive arrival (which sold 7.8 million units back in November 2020, though was limited by stock availability).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, the Switch 2's flagship launch game, has now sold 9.57 million copies, with 8.1 million units of that total from the console's bundle. (So yes, more than a million people paid $80 to buy it separately.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's second biggest Switch 2 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has notched up 3.49 million sales since its July debut. Super Mario Party Jamboree — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, meanwhile, has sold 1.16 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word in today's data on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which launched too recently to be included.

But can the aging console shift another six million units to finally dethrone the best-selling console ever, PlayStation 2? Nintendo says it expects Switch 1 to have reached a lifetime total of 156 million by the end of March 2026, so it will come close.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p>Darwin's evolution</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this year, in Sony's February State of Play, Konami revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darwins_paradox">Darwin's Paradox!</a>, an octopus platformer with more than a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Inside</a>-esque stealth gameplay under the hood. A Switch 1 version was announced at the time, but a new trailer suggests that things might have made the jump entirely to Switch 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 1 icon at the end of the reveal trailer has been solely replaced by its Switch 2 counterpart in the new footage, accompanied by a <strong>2026</strong> release window.</p>
<p>So, the old hardware might be missing out, but the new trailer has got its tentacles around us, all the same. The Inside vibes are still present and correct, as Darwin the octopus stealthily completes platforming puzzles while avoiding the gaze of creepy, dystopian scenes in the background.</p>
<p>There are abilities like flying when filled with hot air, or twanging across large gaps that make things look a little more family-friendly than Playdead's depressing affair, but we sense there'll be a decent number of chills along the way, too.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screens from the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/darwins_paradox/">Konami website</a>, so you can get an idea of the dread under the colourful surface:</p>

<p>Alongside the new gameplay trailer, Konami has also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emK1N6GWvIU">Darwin's Paradox dev deepdive</a> with some of the team from ZDT Studio, which delves into the game's inspirations and stealthy protagonist.</p>
<p>So yes, the Switch 1 version may be dead in the water, but we'll be excited to check this one out on Switch 2 — hopefully with some improved specs to boot — at some point in 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-a-bunch-of-hackers-freed-the-kinect-from-the-xbox.1343044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In 2010, when Microsoft unveiled the Kinect, it pitched the camera as a revolutionary new gaming device. Swing an imaginary lightsaber and that would be translated onscreen. Throw a football and it would be caught on your TV. Fifteen years later, we know the Kinect as an expensive failure. Microsoft overestimated the demand for playing games with your body. But the Kinect did still turn out to be revolutionary — just not for gaming.</p><div><p>Now, we understand the Kinect is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/mar/03/ghost-hunting-pornography-and-interactive-art-the-weird-afterlife-of-xbox-kinect">anything but a gaming device</a>. It became <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12559231">a robotics game changer</a>, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/kinect-sex-game-offers-interactive-porn/story?id=12413950">enjoyed a brief dalliance with pornography</a>, and is now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting">upsold as a ghost hunting toy</a>. None of which would have been possible had a community of hackers not come together to fashion open source drivers for the Kinect, freeing it from the limitations of being locked to the Xbox 360 and opening new frontiers of experimentation, creative expression, and commercial advancement.</p></div><p>“Technically, nothing the Kinect did was entirely new,” says Memo Akten, <a href="https://www.memo.tv/">an artist working with code, data, and AI</a> and an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. The small camera projected a grid of infrared dots and read deformities in that pattern to discern depth. In an early example of machine learning, it recognized human limbs and gestures. “Those capabilities existed in research and industrial systems for many years,” he adds. Those systems cost in the region of $5,000 to $12,000. Here was Microsoft selling a variation of the technology for $150.</p><p>“What had previously required very expensive equipment and/or complex multi-camera setups with manual alignments, calibration, and correspondence was now available off the shelf,” Akten continues.</p><p>Kyle Machulis, CEO of Nonpolynomial and founder of <a href="http://buttplug.io/">buttplug.io</a> — an open source project for controlling sex toys — was working on $250,000 mapping systems not dissimilar to the Kinect in 2010. He quickly recognized the peripheral as an opportunity to “democratize that technology.”</p><p>He recalls heading out on November 4th to pick up a Kinect to reverse engineer. An hour later, New York-based DIY electronics producer Adafruit announced OpenKinect: <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/11/04/the-open-kinect-project-the-ok-prize-get-1000-bounty-for-kinect-for-xbox-360-open-source-drivers/">a bounty of $1,000</a> — a prize that it would raise to $3,000 — for whomever offered evidence of the Kinect working on any operating system.</p><p>“Imagine being able to use this off the shelf camera for Xbox for Mac, Linux, Win, embedded systems, robotics, etc.,” Adafruit wrote in its announcement. “We know Microsoft isn’t developing this device for FIRST Robotics, but we could! Let’s reverse engineer this together, get the RGB and distance out of it and make cool stuff!”</p><p>Doing so was not a simple case of taking the Kinect apart or plugging it in. Though it could connect to a PC via USB, the way they communicated was unknown and the only way to get at it was to watch the Kinect and Xbox 360 speaking to one another. “Since the Kinect didn’t have PC drivers, we needed this piece of hardware called a USB sniffer,” Machulis tells <em>The Verge</em>. A colloquial term for a protocol analyzer, a USB sniffer is a tool that could record the data passed between the Kinect and Xbox 360. In 2010, that cost $1,200 and, Machulis says, “I <em>really </em>didn’t want to buy it.”</p><p>Some information could be gleaned by simply connecting the Kinect to the PC, but it was mostly unhelpful — power consumption, packet sizes, and confirming the Kinect is, in fact, a camera. Hackers<em> could </em>start sending random packets and possibly work <em>something </em>out, but it was just as liable to brick the Kinect completely.</p><p>Hackers and reverse engineers around the world were raring to go. But it appeared that whoever got their hands on a sniffer would win the bounty almost by default. That race wasn’t just for the money, however, but also the cachet of being the first to hack such a high-profile device. With the community stalled over the massive expense — almost half the bounty — it opened the door for someone outside the community to potentially snatch the glory away.</p><p>To keep the contest equitable — and, perhaps, to try and maintain the bounty’s and the company’s momentum in the press, Adafruit took on that expense, ordering a sniffer to then release the logs to the community. But while everyone waited for the device to ship to Brooklyn, it appeared the worst had already happened and someone had beaten them to the punch.</p><p>“AlexP” released a video the next day <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkODbZwGinQ">demonstrating control of the Kinect’s motor</a> on PC. It prompted <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/bounty-offered-for-open-source-kinect-driver/">a panicked response</a> from Microsoft denying the Kinect could be hacked while threatening to explore legal options. Microsoft quickly U-turned when it became clear no one was trying to hack consumers’ cameras. But as the community reeled from potential litigation, AlexP returned with a second video. This time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18vSblw5SNk">he showed off depth and RGB images on PC</a>. The contest was over before it had begun.</p><p>AlexP didn’t claim the bounty, however. Instead, his company, Code Laboratories, opened a $10,000 “fund,” upon payment of which Code Laboratories would release the source code to the open source community. For some in the OpenKinect community, this wasn’t so far removed from what Adafruit — which was already benefitting from significant press — was doing. Even if Adafruit was looking to open source the Kinect drivers and Code Laboratories to sell the drivers as it had with the PlayStation Eye before. For others, it was tantamount to a ransom, withholding code that could make the Kinect more accessible and unleashing its potential easier. “But that was great motivation for the community to just be like: <em>Let’s take $10,000 away from you, actually</em>,” Machulis says.</p><p>A competitive edge shouldn’t be surprising in a contest for a bounty. According to Machulis, however, there was more to it. “That’s the thing about reverse engineering; It’s who gets their name on it first and loudest.”</p><p>On the evening of November 9th, Adafruit finally uploaded the logs collected by its sniffer, and the community began to pore over them. They were searching for the protocols that controlled the Kinect, exploring packets that might turn on a light, enable a camera, or operate the motor. It was incremental, tedious, and exhausting work.</p><p>As US hackers dropped off in the early hours, the clock ticked over to the Kinect’s European release date. Like his American peers, 20-year-old Hector “marcan” Martin purchased a Kinect and, armed with Adafruit’s logs, went through packet by packet to divine the Kinect’s protocols.</p><p>When the US woke, it did so to the fruits of his dogged examination: <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2010/11/10/we-have-a-winner-open-kinect-drivers-released-winner-will-use-3k-for-more-hacking-plus-an-additional-2k-goes-to-the-eff/">a video of Martin demonstrating RGB and depth on Linux</a>. It had taken six days for OpenKinect to hack the Kinect from its release — really, once the logs became available, it had taken Martin less than 24 hours.</p><p>That was far from the end, however. “Hector certainly did most of the hard, technical work in terms of getting the initial packets set up,” Machulis says. “Then everyone realized this shit is gonna get big.” The bounty claimed, the community set its sights on more drivers.</p><p>Theo Watson spent three weeks at his computer working on OpenKinect — every day, 10 hours a day. The Kinect revolutionized how <a href="https://www.design-io.com/">Design I/O</a>, which Watson co-founded, developed interactive installations, and he <a href="https://www.design-io.com/projects/connectedworlds">still uses it today</a>. In 2010, however, he was 30 years old, recently transplanted to the US, isolating limb data from infrared cameras.</p><p>“I saw that time off as an R&amp;D investment,” he says, a way to open more efficient avenues to bigger and better interactive experiences. “I really wanted to be the first person to get the Kinect running on a Mac.”</p><p>The OpenKinect community had coalesced around a remote nucleus of reverse engineers from different countries, generations, and demographic groups. There was drama, frayed nerves, but also a common goal, as Watson discovered while trawling through the process of running the Kinect on OSX.</p><p>“I think it really helped because it felt like you were part of a team effort,” he says. “If people were running into problems, it’s like having a collective brain. The Kinect basically needs everything to be perfect. If you’re off by one little thing, you don’t get anything. Then, suddenly, someone notices something and it works.”</p><p>Driven by the community, with a bit of help from Martin, Watson had the Kinect talking to Mac by November 12th. More drivers and code filled the community’s GitHub, and hacking efforts wound down. “There’s only so much to extract and then you have to be able to do something with that data,” Machulis says. “Those are two fairly different skillsets.”</p><p>Instead, people like Akten stepped in. The first open source drivers, libfreenect, didn’t include body tracking — Microsoft released its own skeletal SDK in 2011, its hand forced by OpenKinect — only granting access to raw depth data. “We could still do a lot with that,” Akten says. “For one thing, we had the 3D data, which allowed all kinds of creative, playful interpretations.”</p><div><p>The community chat flooded with experiments, many Akten’s. He explored <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F16818988" rel="sponsored">drawing in 3D space</a>, later moving on to develop <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F122166652" rel="sponsored">machine learning algorithms to detect poses</a>, and even <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F55125701" rel="sponsored">controlling drones</a>. The Kinect was open, bringing with it a host of explorations of how to exploit it creatively. Suddenly, an affordable way for robots to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01691864.2014.944212">detect obstacles and map environments in real time became available</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2014/01/13/exploring-medical-uses-of-kinect-technology/">surgeons explored examining scans contactless</a>, rapid <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/skanect/">3D models of rooms and objects</a> became a real possibility, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2012/03/06/teachers-are-using-kinect-for-xbox-360-to-engage-students-and-bring-learning-to-life/">teachers used the Kinect as an interactive learning device</a>, and, if you really wanted, <a href="https://www.metafetish.com/2010/11/28/kinect-sex/">someone could now control a sex toy</a> over a video call.</p></div><p>“This thing on the front camera,” Watson says, pointing to the black bar at the top of his iPhone’s screen, “that, I think, is a miniature Kinect.”</p><p>He’s almost wistful. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5141416/apple-confirms-primesense-acquisition">Apple purchased PrimeSense</a>, the Israeli company behind the Kinect’s sensor technology, in 2013. “I was so disappointed,” he says, “because I just knew that was the end of the Kinect technology.”</p><div><p>The sale prompted Microsoft to explore a new system for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4353232/kinect-xbox-one-hands-on">its next Kinect</a> — OpenKinect went and hacked that one too — discontinuing Kinect for Windows shortly after its release in 2014 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542870/microsoft-kinect-dead-stop-manufacturing">shutting down manufacturing for the Kinect in 2017</a> as sales diminished and it focused on the Kinect 2 and development of the third-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239860/microsoft-kinect-azure-dk-hands-on-mwc-2019">Kinect Azure</a>. Yet, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/17/16315510/iphone-x-notch-kinect-apple-primesense-microsoft">the technology has lived on</a>, incorporated into countless Apple devices as part of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/why-did-apple-buy-primesense-for-a-key-technology-itll-deploy-within-a-year">facial recognition and 3D mapping</a> to the point of being ubiquitous.</p></div><p>That sense of loss extends, in part, to the internet from which OpenKinect emerged. “It was way more punk rock!” Watson laughs. “No one had really established the rules.”</p><p>In 2010, the internet was unruly; it had yet to coalesce around the hubs it has today. Piracy was in its heyday, pre-AlexNet — a major neural network architecture that paved the way for modern AI models like Stable Diffusion — with GitHub, now an online staple, having released only three years before (the same year as Tumblr and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures">the iPhone’s reveal</a>). “We were only four or five years into the maker movement,” Machulis says. “The idea of a product like this that has taken a massive amount of R&amp;D cost to be put out and hacked this quickly — it was basically unheard of.”</p><p>Now, with better tools, it’s far more common. Which is part of why we don’t hear about it as much as before — that, and not being attached to, as Machulis puts it, a “shining sun” of a product. “It is in general easier to make some of this stuff,” Machulis continues. “There’s way more communities online, there’s more content creators talking about this stuff.” The kind of effort surrounding opening the Kinect has now lost some of its buccaneering flavor, some of its sense of counterculture, simply by virtue of becoming more mainstream and, in many ways, more frequent. “I don’t think anything fizzled out,” Machulis adds. “I think it just got quieter and spread out.”</p><p>Still, there is a sense that how we approach technology has changed irreparably. “I think technology has become more of a product now and less something that you get involved with. That’s kind of sad,” Watson adds. “I kind of fear that the current generation is growing up just thinking the internet is inflexible. It is the way it is and nothing will ever change. We were constantly surrounded by that change. And it really made things feel more free and more open.”</p><p>Rather, similar communities to OpenKinect may feel invisible without a subject as high-profile as the Kinect. As the economic bubble inflating around AI grows more opaque as corporate interests scramble to make the technology a profit-turning industry, hackers have turned their attention to open sourcing its models. Aligned to a sprawling technology constantly in the public eye, it may well be that AI grants us our next big communal reverse engineering effort to echo OpenKinect. This is especially curious given the Kinect gave many of us our first interactions with AI, and it is AI that is finally interrupting the Kinect’s spirited afterlife.</p><p>“When the original Kinect came out, it took what might have been 100 hours of me writing computer vision code with a standard black-and-white infrared camera and gave me something that would shave that time off our development for a project <em>and </em>give better-quality results,” Watson says. “AI with code is doing a similar thing; they just take away the painful aspects of the work and let us focus on the creative part.”</p><p>Now, 15 years after hackers opened the Kinect to computer vision creatives, AI can do everything it did better, faster, and using standard RGB cameras. Watson shows <em>The Verge </em>a video of AI’s real-time tracking, its superior occlusion of limbs and digits blitzing across the screen as members of a K-pop group weave around one another, each marked by a colored skeleton on the screen — all pulled from an ordinary camera. “AI is made to make decisions about many things very quickly, and we need a decision about every pixel in an image,” Machulis says. “Since we can tell so much just from images now we may not need all the extra hardware, with methods like gaussian splatting we’re already seeing that ability to, what looks like, create information from thin air.”</p><p>“Next time we chat, we might have gone back to infrared cameras,” Watson says, before adding: “AI might kill the Kinect.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/812803/hacking-kinect-history]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The servers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> had a bit of a "wobble" on Sunday, as many would-be raiders of the arc queued up to get in. Developers Embark have now decided to offer those affected by the outage some free in-game as a make good for said server swoonage.</p>
<p>The wobble came on November 2nd, as the game was hovering around the 300 to 330k concurrent player mark. It's left a brief, but unmistakeable dip in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">SteamDB graph</a>. Think one of those heart machines having a quick blip before regular beats resume.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue messages from the studio on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1107589599045361695/1107613897357275188/1434939304437612671">Discord</a> and the <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381341337096402">Tweeter</a> late yesterday. "We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday," reads the latter. Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step. As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday."</p>
<p>A "Server Slammer" variant of the hiker backpack has also been sent out to players who were present, so if that's you, there's a good chance both are already waiting in your inbox. Buying 500 tokes will set you back around £4 / $5 worth of real money, so it's a decently valuable gift in return for persevering through a technical hiccup that looks to have had relatively minimal impact in the grand scheme of server swoons.</p><p>Embark could easily have just shrugged and moved on without dishing out any goodies. From a cynical and PR-savvy perspective, it's an easy win requiring a bit of cash sacrifice, but likely returning plenty of value in the most important battle any shooter faces - the one over player hearts and minds. It's also just a nice thing to do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While Fortnite players are currently enjoying the slew of The Simpsons-related content in the game, further big changes are on the horizon with the release date of Chapter 7 rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s mini-season themed around The Simpsons will only be here for a few weeks before the setting of Springfield is left behind and a new adventure begins with Chapter 7, which will mark the start of the next year of content for Fortnite.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering just how long there is to enjoy The Simpsons content and want to know the release date for Chapter 7, we’ve got all the crucial details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-fortnite-chapter-7-release">When Does Fortnite Chapter 7 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big things are coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite is set to kick off on November 29, following the end of The Simpsons-themed mini-season that brings a conclusion to Chapter 6.</strong></p>



<p>The end date of the current season, and the subsequent start of the next Fortnite chapter, was revealed in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> for The Simpsons mini-season, and we already know there will be the customary end-of-chapter event that marks the start of the new chapter.</p>



<p>Specific timing for the event and launch of Chapter 7 have not been revealed yet, however, and there will be downtime ahead of the start of the new chapter. Given how large of an update this will be, and the vast changes that will take place, the downtime could be longer than the standard end-of-season downtime.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-chapter-7">What’s Coming in Fortnite Chapter 7?</h2>



<p><strong>Chapter 7 in Fortnite will see vast changes to the game, with a new map in Battle Royale, a host of new weapons, and tweaks to core gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>In previous years, new chapters have resulted in huge introductions like Fortnite Festival and LEGO Fortnite, alongside marking the start of major new collaborations. While specifics are lacking at this stage, it certainly promises to be an exciting time for Fortnite players.</p>



<p>Leaks have already started ahead of Chapter 7, with it stated that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> will feature in upcoming collabs, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood setting is also rumored</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll also see the start of Winterfest 2025 during the first season of Chapter 7, likely during early December, which will likely offer the usual slew of free cosmetics.</p>

<p>Retroid has confirmed that there is no official licensing deal for Soulja Boy’s new handheld retro console, SouljaGameFlip. </p>



<p>The retro handheld console market has experienced significant growth in the past few years, with several new major players entering the scene in recent years. Retroid is a popular name in the retro handheld market, and it appears that some of their consoles are being sold by Soulja Boy as his own device, without an official deal in place. </p>



<h2 id="h-soulja-boy-is-selling-rebranded-retroid-consoles-at-more-than-double-the-price">Soulja Boy is Selling Rebranded Retroid Consoles At More than Double the Price </h2>



<p>Soulja Boy started marketing the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 as the SouljaGameFlip on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">souljaboygame Instagram account</a>. One of their recent post has the hip-hop artist showcasing the console in his hand while talking about all the games and apps it features, including “Sonic, TikTok, Instagram and everything ya need.” </p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>, Retroid was not aware that Soulja Boy was selling their retro consoles as his own. The official statement from a representative states, “I didn’t know about this. This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves”. </p>



<p>If you visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.souljaboy.net/product-page/souljagame-flip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>&nbsp;where the SouljaGameFlip is being sold, it becomes blatantly obvious that the device is just a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2; even the images for the console are the same ones used on Retroid’s website. Furthermore, the rapper has more than doubled the price of the original console, with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 priced at $209 and the SouljaGameFlip costing $436.50. </p>

                <p>Nintendo has confirmed that in the last two quarters, it has sold a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">staggering number of Switch 2 consoles</a>. As part of its latest financial results, the company reported 10.36 million Switch 2 units sold as of September 30, in the two quarters since it went on sale. In the last three months alone, Nintendo sold 4.54 million Switch 2 consoles.</p><p>To put that into context, that's more than double what the original Switch console sold within the same two-month time period (4.7 million units sold), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-year-1-sales-compared-ahead-of-wii-u-behind-ps4-and-more/1100-6500218/">and even more than what Sony managed with the PS4</a> (7.5 million units sold) and PS5 (7.8 million units sold) during its first two quarters. With the Switch 2 selling well, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo has now increased its hardware forecast</a> for the business year, as it predicts that it'll sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">up from its original estimate of 15 million</a>. If Nintendo reaches this number, that'll put Switch 2 sales far ahead of the original Switch, PS4, and PS5 consoles during their launch years.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As for its predecessor, the Switch has now reached 154.01 million units sold since 2017. This puts the Switch within spitting distance of the Nintendo DS, which sold 154.02 million units. Nintendo noted a 60% decline in Switch sales when compared to the same period in its previous fiscal year, but it is predicting that the console will dethrone the Nintendo DS by the end of its financial year and will cement itself as the company's best-selling console of all time.</p><p>In the games department, Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World has reached 9.57 million lifetime sales to date, and it is selling far better than its predecessor, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The game has a 92% attach rate, and around 8.1 million of these sales were from the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included the game. Donkey Kong Bananza has reached an impressive 3.49 million units sold since it launched in July, and the Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree has hit 1.16 million units sold.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo has a strong lineup for the holiday season. This month will see the launch of Kirby Air Riders and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, while December will see the highly anticipated release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo’s latest quarterly report has revealed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has already sold more than 10 million consoles by the end of September, continuing its record-setting status as the fastest selling games console.</p>
<p>Having launched on 5th June, the Switch 2’s sales figures are split between the quarters ending on 30th June and 30th September. In its launch month alone, the Switch 2 raced to 5.82 million units sold, and this was followed by 4.54 million units through the rest of the summer. That puts the total at 10.36 million after four months, far outpacing the 7.8 million record of the PlayStation 5 through its first two quarters, and massively ahead of the original Switch. That console launched in early March 2017 and shipped 4.7 million through its first four months.</p>


<p>And here’s the thing. This 10 million consoles sold? That’s before the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last month, which will absolutely have pushed many prospective Pokémon players to upgrade.</p>
<p>Instead, the main highlight games for the Switch 2 are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> which, thanks to being a console bundle game, enjoys a near 1:1 sales record at 9.57 million copies, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> at 3.49 million copies. A pretty good effort from DK, I’d say.</p>

<p>Indeed, while we heaped praise on the game for its excellent interactive documentary and wide selection of games in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">7/10 review</a>, we noted that the online functionality is simply not up to scratch at the moment.

<p>In fact, this latter issue appears to be so prevalent that some players over on PS5 have actually been awarded full refunds from Sony (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/sonys-allowing-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-refunds-because-the-ps5-ps4-compilation-is-a-downright-nightmare-for-some">Push Square</a>). A Reddit post from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Natural_Parsnip_5291/">Natural_Parsnip_5291</a> stated that "the AI input reading is a downright nightmare".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jhqxno&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Digital Eclipse is, however, working incredibly hard to resolve the issues that have arisen since launch. In fact, Head of Production Stephen Frost has been remarkably communicative over on X regarding player grievances, and recently stated that he is "running on fumes" in attempting to respond to all of the complaints.</p>

<p>The company has, however, confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-update-announced-here-are-the-patch-notes">a patch is already available on Steam</a>, with fixes addressing audio issues when playing online, missing audio from the 32X version of MKII, and more general stability. This patch is due to release on console at any moment.</p>
<p>Stephen Frost has also stated that more patches are due to go into testing imminently, so it seems crystal clear that the team is razor-focused on improving Legacy Kollection for players on all platforms. If you're not keen on diving in right now, we'd advise keeping your eye out for future updates – we're confident Digital Eclipse can stabilise things.</p>

In its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">latest earnings release</a>, covering April 1st to September 30th, Nintendo now predicts that it’ll sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, compared to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">previous forecast of 15 million</a>.</p><p>The Japanese gaming giant reports that 10.36 million Switch 2 consoles have been sold so far following its launch in June, with 4.54 million sales falling under its latest earnings period. 20.62 million Switch 2 games have also been sold since launch, though Nintendo has only raised its Switch 2 game forecast from 45 million to 48 million.</p><p>The combined hardware and software sales are driving a 110 percent surge in revenue, which increased to ¥1,099.5 billion (around $7.1 billion) between April and September, compared to ¥523.2 billion (around $3.4 billion) for the same period last year.

            <p>Yo ho, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>'s 1.3.0 update arrives today, November 4th.

<p>As outlined in the developer update video above, the "sweeping changes to individual civs" promised in the studio's last blog are mainly focused on delivering "significant buffs" to 12 nations a lot of folks play as. Axum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Sanghai, and Spain have all seen changes, with the newly renamed Achaemenid Persia rounding out the list.</p>
<p>These civs have gotten "more specific bonuses" aimed at ensuring they "lean into a unique play style" and making your starting position on the map factor more heavily into how your wider strategy plays out. For example, Egypt will now receive tailored bonuses for building settlements and districts along river tiles, better reflecting their historical reliance on the Nile," explained Civ creative director Ed Beach. "Achaemenid Persia will get far more culture benefits for the Pairidaeza unique improvement as well as additional happiness and culture from capturing settlements."</p><p>These sorts of changes extend into the update's fresh addition when it comes to sea and coastal tiles, with the Hawaii civ getting a head start on working with ocean tiles in the exploration age, rewarding using them to push in a watery direction from the get go.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the update overhauls the treasure fleet's interface via the addition of a "clear treasure point value" to help you tell how much the swag they're carrying is worth at a glance. Resource icon art has also had some distracting background colours toned down, so they should be easier on the eyes. Finally, selecting a scout will now see tiles with things to discover highlighted with a special blue and white outline, making it harder to miss things if you're leaning on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">auto-explore</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how these tweaks go down, as Civ 7 and devs Fiarxis continue along what's at times been a pretty rocky and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> post-release road.</p>
