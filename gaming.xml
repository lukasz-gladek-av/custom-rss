              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon is something I’ve never fully grasped, but I can certainly appreciate the concept of a collector’s mindset. For decades, Pokémon players have hunted prestigious cards, either to bolster their collection or to sell on the open market, but some might not be aware of what they have in their deck.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the Pokémon World Championship in California, a little research was put together to outline the super rare Pokémon cards that players might be unwittingly sitting on.</p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-expensive-original-pokemon-card">What’s The Most Expensive Original Pokémon Card?</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Pinnacle</a>, a combination of resale data, keyword trends, and geographical aggregates was used to identify the most expensive original Pokémon cards by market value and popularity.</p>



<p>At the top of the table sat the Gyrados Star card from the Holon Phantoms category, worth an estimated $2,000. This Gold Star card is one of the most searched-for items amongst Pokémon collectors, particularly those in California and Texas.</p>



<p>The second most expensive original Pokémon card is Mewtwo, from the Base Set Shadowless category. This card commands a price of around $900, and it’s one of the super rare Pokémon cards you might have lingering in a binder somewhere.</p>



<p>Here’s Pinnacle’s data from the top ten most expensive original Pokémon cards:</p>



<ol>
<li>Gyrados Star (Holon Phantoms) – $1,999</li>



<li>Mewtwo (Base Set Shadowless) – $900</li>



<li>Venusaur (Base Set Shadowless) – $793</li>



<li>Rocket’s Snorlax Ex (Team Rocket Returns) – $595</li>



<li>Sabrina’s Gengar (Gym Heroes) – $579</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set) – $455</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set Shadowless) – $420</li>



<li>Dark Charizard (Team Rocket) – $386</li>



<li>Rocket’s Mewtwo (Gym Challenge) – £336</li>



<li>Charizard (Base Set 2) – $311</li>
</ol>



<p>To get this list, Pinnacle used a seed list of the most valuable Pokémon cards, then combined that with the current market price (fluctuations can happen) and keyword data from Google to produce the ranking. </p>



<p>Do you have any of these cards in your collection? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"Secure Boot is how you're helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Could Be The Successor To Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 The Series Needs | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>While SecureBoot isn't foolproof, EA claims it has used it alongside other measures to crack down on cheating significantly. According to EA, 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls were prevented with Javelin anti-cheat alone--as of August 8--thousands of cheaters were reported each day, and its Battlefield teams are coordinating efforts to improve the integrity of the game.</p><p>Echoing the statements made by Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-the-day-we-die-battlefield-6-devs-talk-anti-cheat/1100-6533635/">about being locked in an anti-cheat arms race</a>, EA says it'll continue to work on staying a step ahead of cheaters. While there are several reasons why gamers will use cheats to gain an advantage, one thing is for certain--<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-multimillion-dollar-grey-market-for-video-game-cheats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the market for cheats can be <em>very </em>lucrative.</a></p><p>The second Battlefield 6 open beta starts on August 14, and in the wake of the first weekend, there has been a lot of discussion about the game. Former AEW champion--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-star-anthony-mackie-is-a-big-fan-of-these-classic-games/1100-6533429/">and noted gamer</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/samoa-joe-shares-his-battlefield-6-impressions-and-they-are-highly-relatable/1100-6533826/">Samoa Joe also hopped into the beta on the weekend</a>, and he's wondering if Battlefield 6's positive reception is being shaped by Battlefield 2042's poor reception.</p><p>Battlefield 6 will launch on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|sS.</p>

<figure><a title="mc Donalds Japan Pokemon meal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60ef64327cfdc/mc-donalds-japan-pokemon-meal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>McDonald's restaurants in Japan seem to have got a little more than they bargained for over this past weekend, as a promotion between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and the company's Happy Meals <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">had to shut down early</a>. The reason? "Higher-than-expected sales". However, it appears there's more going on here — and, as you can guess, scalpers seem to be involved.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/1c1915d3214b722cc3eebc6d467ba25b5e23dc65">Yahoo Japan</a> and as seen on social media (cheers, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/10/japan-mcdonalds-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-due-to-higher-than-expected-sales/">MyNintendoNews</a>) customers have been showing off counters in stores that are lined with wasted food, purchased only for the Pokémon cards inside. The promotion was originally due to run between 9th and 11th August, but was pulled after just 24 hours.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22flsjxqg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The huge food wastage, and rather obvious surge in popularity combined, was enough to force the fast-food chain to wind the promo down ahead of time. McDonald's Japan said: "We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of this distribution."</p>
<p>It concluded that customers should "refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.campaignasia.com/article/mcdonalds-japans-pokemon-promo-backfires-ends-in-scalping-and-food-waste-contr/504139">Campaign Asia</a> reports that, in some McDonald's stores, customers were calling the police due to rising tensions between some and those they suspected were buying to scalp the cards online.</p>
<p>There are also a whole bunch of rather shameful posts all over social media from the weekend, most showing off food that was dumped by scalpers. At least there were also <a href="https://x.com/iijNWqUQ7i41630/status/1954325909106041136">a few pigeons</a> getting involved for some free grub too. Silver linings and all that.</p>
<p>The plan, in order to deter troublesome scalping in the first place, had apparently been to limit customers to five of the Pokémon Happy Meals per person but, of course, scammers have very quickly managed to circumvent this by using online accounts</p>
<p>Though one customer did attempt to buy <em>40</em> Happy Meals in-store.</p>

<p>McDonald's in the UK has had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">Pokémon back in-store of late</a>, too, although it seems they have managed to swerve scalper problems this time out, having perhaps learned their lesson <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">following an incident in 2021</a> that saw much the same sort of chaos in the US following the launch of Pokémon Happy Meals there.</p>
<p>Still, scalping is a huge problem for the TCG, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">some ignoring tornado warnings</a> just to buy packs to resell.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Is Making a Far Cry TV Series with FX]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-show-fx-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-making-a-far-cry-tv-series-with-fx.1267050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the recently confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed live-action TV series at Netflix</a>, Ubisoft has confirmed that it has another adaptation of one of its franchises in the works. This time, it's in collaboration with FX, and it's a TV series adaptation of the Far Cry franchise.</p>



<p>But this announcement isn't like the Assassin's Creed one, because it wasn't supposed to be live. Ubisoft let the news slip on its website before quickly redacting and redirecting the page, though not quickly enough that it wasn't shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">Reddit</a> and caught by the rest of the internet.</p>



<p>The details of the series which remain on Reddit reveal that the series is set to be an anthology, where "<em>each season will be set in a new world with a different cast of characters following the video game franchise's signature standalone storytelling format</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding the talent behind the series, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star and co-creator Rob Mac <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rob-mcelhenney-legally-change-name-rob-mac-1236443403/">(formerly known as Rob McElhenney)</a> and Noah Hawley, the creator and writer behind FX's Fargo series and more recently its soon-to-debut at the time of this writing Alien: Earth series are leading the charge on FX's take on the world of Far Cry.</p>



<p>Mac is set to star in the Far Cry series, at least for the first season, presumably, while Hawley will take showrunning duties. Mac will also be an executive producer alongside Hawley, Jackie Cohn of More Better Productions, Michael Garcia of 26Keys Productions, and Nick Frenkel of 3Arts Entertainment. For Ubisoft's part, Gerad Guillemot, Margret Boykin, and Austin Dill are alongside as executive producers from Ubisoft's film and television division. </p>



<p>Boykin, head of Ubisoft's film and television division, is quoted as saying "<em>This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches. Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling</em>."</p>



<p>Since it'll be an anthology series, there's no expectation that it'll try to follow in the footsteps of previous Far Cry games. It's more likely that the show will focus on telling its own stories, so maybe don't expect Vaas to show up or anything like that. That said, there's always the chance Mac and Hawley could do their own thing with the show while leaving a few Easter-eggs for fans of the games to pick up on. Hopefully, we'll know more about it soon, whenever Ubisoft decides to put the news back on its website.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-turned-down-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-reportedly-turned-down-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster.1267047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA apparently turned down a&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy remaster pitched by BioWare, denying the series the same treatment that the publisher's original&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>releases received a few years ago.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview between YouTuber MrMattyPlays and ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), in which Darrah says that BioWare suggested remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, to be released as&nbsp;<em>The Champions Trilogy</em>.</p>

<p>According to Darrah, though, EA is "against remasters", and while he doesn't exactly know why, he wryly says it's because the publisher "basically seem[s] to be against free money". Given EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/buying-fifa-loot-boxes-is-fair-according-to-ea" rel="nofollow">championing of loot boxes</a> in the likes of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, I'm not sure about that, but I see his point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-inquisition-dragon-age-trilogy-remasters.jpg?itok=gJKeSX7J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-inquisition-dragon-age-trilogy-remasters.jpg?itok=sqTO-EGS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remasters of the first three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games were apparently pitched, but rejected by EA.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Darrah's interview, BioWare's resources were split between the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which was released last year to an initially positive but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">eventually largely indifferent</a> reception. That's another reason no trilogy remasters were made, Darrah says.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that while all three&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>games were made in Unreal Engine 3, all three&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>games constituting the series' original trilogy were made with different engines, so remastering them would have been a more difficult task. Still, I'm sure there was a way to get that work done, so it's a shame EA decided not to.</p>

<p>While the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game remains in active development (<a href="https://fextralife.com/bioware-clarifies-the-status-of-mass-effect-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">as far as we know</a>),&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s future as a franchise looks to be a little more in doubt.&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>underperformed for EA, and CEO Andrew Wilson seemingly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">insinuated back in February</a> that the game's failure could be put down to its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>Whether that means we'll get another&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game with a more live-service bent, as&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>was meant to be, remains to be seen. Perhaps BioWare will be able to convince EA to make another game in the series, or maybe it will be shelved for the time being. Only time will tell.</p>




<p>For now, you can content yourself with the fact that the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>trilogy is still on sale on PC via Steam, and&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is also available now, although you may well find it an acquired taste if you're a huge fan of the originals (particularly&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>).</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Some upsetting news from the past weekend: Bithell Games, the Mike Bithell-founded indie studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/john-wick-hex">John Wick Hex</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a> and the just-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, are laying off 11 developers. That’s "The majority of our full-time staff," according to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">post</a> on Bithell’s personal Bluesky account.</p>
<p>The redundancies follow a sad pattern of widespread job losses – albeit usually in much larger numbers – across the games industry in recent years. In Bithell Games’ case, they’re allegedly the result of the studio "being unable to secure a new larger-scale project" to follow Tron: Catalyst.</p>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell’s statement reads. "We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible."</p>
<p>It also claims that ongoing support for currently-available games will be unaffected. Bithell Games as an entity will also continue to exist, though following these layoffs, it’s hard to see how their next game (if any) will follow much of their previous post-Thomas work in using a well-known licensed property as a basis. Which is sort of a shame in itself, as the company’s creative takes on what could have easily been rote tie-in games – for series that would appear to dwarf the scope of a team that only ever numbered in the low double figures – have always been admirably eye-catching. John Wick Hex was not a brainless shooter but a stylish and precise strategy adventure; Catalyst, a thoughtfully executed top-down RPG. That kind of boldness is easy to respect, and will be likely missed.</p>
<p>Alas, so cutthroat is modern game development that almost no known measure of success will effectively block the knife. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">financially lucrative games</a>? Layoffs. Make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">critically acclaimed games</a>? Layoffs. Be owned by one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">richest and most profitable companies on Earth</a>? Believe it or not, straight to layoffs.</p>
<p>At least in response, developers have been pushing harder than ever before towards unionisation and stronger protections for game industry workers. The The UVW-CWA (United Videogame Workers/Communication Workers of America) launched the US and Canada’s first industry-wide, direct-join union <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">at GDC this year</a>, while just this month, QA staff at Call of Duty co-dev studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-qa-staff-secure-union-contract-with-microsoft-to-stop-them-being-treated-like-cannon-fodder">signed their first union contract</a> with Microsoft and Activision-Bizzard.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><span>got a remastered trilogy collection in 2021</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans have been hoping and praying BioWare’s fantasy RPGs might get the same treatment. If there were ever a time to put one out, it would have been before </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>launched in 2024 and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>seemingly wrapped up</span></a><span> most of the universe’s ongoing story threads. According to ex-BioWare boss Mark Darrah, the studio was more than up for remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age: Origins</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span> in one collection and told Electronic Arts as much, but the publisher turned down the pitch.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0"><span>YouTuber MrMattyPlays sat down with Darrah</span></a><span>, who worked as executive producer on the </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> series and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>troubled loot shooter </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>. During the conversation, Darrah reveals that BioWare “soft-pitched” a remaster of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> games but EA turned it down, partially due to its noted dislike of remasters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“EA’s historically been—and I don’t really know why, but they’ve even said this publicly—they’re kind of against remasters,” he said. “I don’t really know why. It’s strange for a publicly traded company to basically be against free money, but they seem to be against it. So that’s part of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, one of the bigger issues in remastering </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> compared to </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> was that the resources to zhuzh up those games is that they’re on different engines The first two </span><i><span>DA </span></i><span>games were made on BioWare’s internal Eclipse Engine before the team transitioned to Frostbite for </span><i><span>Inquisition</span></i><span>, whereas the first three sci-fi games are all on Unreal Engine. This meant that the technical lift would have been significantly higher for a </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>remaster than it was for </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</span></i><span>. Darrah says the project would have either required hiring a new team to work full-time learning how to use the games’ old tech, or that existing staff at BioWare would have to handle the entire thing on their own. He also says that an internal remaster within BioWare would have been the ideal scenario, but that didn’t pan out.</span></p> <p><span>The soft-pitch Darrah talks about included a sort of “rebrand” of the original games as a trilogy called </span><i><span>The Champions Trilogy</span></i><span>, referencing the three protagonists of each game. If that had come to pass, I would have written you a novel on my feelings about it, considering I think continuity is one of </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>‘s weakest aspects, and branding those games as a trilogy when it decidedly doesn’t follow through on a lot of its connective tissue would be an odd Hail Mary. But since that isn’t happening, I will bite my tongue.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, Darrah doesn’t know what the future holds for </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. He </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-studio-head-dragon-age-producer-both-leave-stu-1845802859"><span>left the company in 2020</span></a><span>, but returned as a consultant to help get </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>past the finish line. Since leaving the company, Darrah </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>has been pretty candid</span></a><span> about what he and his colleagues felt was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-development-mark-darrah-live-service-2000615972"><span>unfair treatment of the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> by management.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-%E2%80%93-battlefield-is-back.1267032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Okay, I’ll admit it. This impressions article was meant to go live during the Battlefield 6 Beta, but the game was so enjoyable for me that I couldn’t stop playing. It’s not an excuse, it’s a fact. This is probably the most time I’ve put in a game, never mind a Beta, in a very long time.</p>



<p>At the end of weekend one, I accumulated 36 hours of playtime, averaging 9 hours per day. To some people, that might be on the mediocre side, but for me, it was the first time in years that I’ve lived and breathed a video game. I felt like a teenager again with zero responsibilities and a never-ending desire to keep playing, and that, my friends, is a magical feeling. </p>



<p>But before my impressions and feedback, I want to give some massive credit where it’s due. I’ll be the first to admit that when I first heard about EA’s all-in approach to Battlefield 6, I wasn’t just worried, I was petrified. The last two installments (Battlefield 5 and Battlefield 2042) were disappointing for me and the wider community for various reasons. EA’s decision to double down on the franchise, especially following the disastrous release of Battlefield 2042, could have ended catastrophically.</p>



<p>But thankfully, Battlefield Studios, which consists of DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion, has done a fantastic job. Yes, there are a few issues here and there, but again, this was just a Beta. The important thing is that the foundations of a great Battlefield game have been laid, and all four studios deserve a massive congratulations, especially with the challenges they faced during development. </p>



<h2 id="h-movement-and-gunplay">Movement and Gunplay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6’s gameplay has been a hot point of discussion this past week, with the game being compared closely to Call of Duty. While I don’t disagree with that sentiment, I also don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing. To me, movement feels like a pretty good balance of that classic Battlefield feel with a few aspects of Call of Duty sprinkled in. Mainly, the new improved movement system (whatever they’ve called it) feels great and presumably will come into its own with Ripple Effect’s Battle Royale mode.</p>



<p>Guns also feel great, and while I spent most of my time with the LMGs, I do think there needs to be some variation between all the weapons. With the right attachments, every gun felt like a laser beam and had a rapid time to kill, regardless of the range. SMGs could do just as well as an assault rifle or LMG in the right hands, and I did become slightly frustrated with how quickly I was dying against the wrong type of weapon.</p>



<p>The developers have weighed in on this on social media and believe that the time to kill (or time to death) is a netcode issue, so hopefully that is something that’s addressed by launch.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<h2 id="h-maps">Maps</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Battlefield Studios </figcaption></figure>



<p>Although there were only three maps available in weekend one of the Beta, I feel like we got a good balance of what the game has to offer. Yes, the maps are small in scale on Siege of Cairo and Iberian Offensive, but I believe the most critical aspect of map design is that they must play well, regardless of size. Thankfully, I feel like both of these maps play well, and I had no issues – apart from people climbing on the roofs on Siege of Cairo.  </p>



<p>Liberation Peak is the largest of the three maps, offering aerial combat. I don’t tend to play in air vehicles, but this map from an infantry perspective played terribly in Conquest and got progressively worse as the Beta went on. I’m not sure if it was intentional or not, but by the time weekend one of the Beta ended, the mountains were covered in glints from sniper rifles and people raining down bullets from quite frankly, stupid places where they probably shouldn’t be able to climb. </p>



<p>It completely ruined the flow of the map, and while I think it’s easily addressed by limiting the climb height of the mountains, I do think the map needs to be reworked slightly. Perhaps a large tunnel through the middle of the mountain, or some large bunker complex, would work well and offer some close-quarters combat apart from the area near the D flag. </p>







<p>One of my biggest gripes with the game thus far is the menus. To me, they are pretty overwhelming even for an experienced Battlefield player, and with Battlefield Studios wanting an easier barrier to entry across the board for the game, the menus need some serious simplification.</p>



<p>From the overall settings to even just modifying my weapon during a match, everything needs to be streamlined to make navigation easier. Having to click four to five times to just change a scope on my gun during a game seems a bit excessive and could be a turn off for many new players.</p>



<h2 id="h-player-visibility">Player Visibility</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another gripe was player visibility in Battlefield 6. While I did manage to “get used to it”, it was still tremendously difficult to spot players if I wasn’t aiming down sights with a 3-4x magnification scope. Often, I would find myself outgunned simply because I wasn’t moving and aiming down sights.</p>



<p>This issue is slightly more exaggerated when you’re either looking into a building or looking out of one. While I understand it from a logical lighting perspective, you should be able to see players shooting from a window or in a broken building, and likewise, the brightness aiming outside a building is way too bright.</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure on a solution here, but I do think there needs to be one. Let’s not introduce wacky skins to make that happen, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall, I think Battlefield 6 will shape up to be a brilliant game. A majority of the bugs and issues I encountered are easily fixable within the two months remaining until launch, and I’m confident that Battlefield Studios will be able to address them.</p>



<p>There are undeniable signs that they want to convert the Call of Duty audience this time around, and with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (releasing November 2025), will rely on nothing but nostalgia this time around, EA and Battlefield Studios are in a strong position to do just that. </p>



<p>I think a key mode to success here will also be Ripple Effect’s Battle Royale mode, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to be a free-to-play experience according to our sources</a>. With Call of Duty: Warzone experiencing a sharp decline over the past couple of years and seemingly no way to bring back players, it could prove to be an excellent opportunity for Battlefield. Simply put, I think there’s a strong desire for a new free-to-play Battle Royale in the market.</p>



<p>If released in Q1 2026, it will give Battlefield a second (or third if you consider the holidays) injection of players and likely on a mass scale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Dragon Age franchise boss Mark Darrah has discussed BioWare's difficulty getting a remaster of the series' first game off the ground, and why it would be a much tougher project than Mass Effect's trilogy re-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, speaking about the future of the Dragon Age series after the mixed response to last year's Veilguard, Darrah told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0&amp;ab_channel=MrMattyPlays" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MrMattyPlays</a> that he was "not sure" how a new entry in the series would get started. Darrah has spoken in the past of how BioWare is now a single-project studio, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">the company now slimmed-down in size</a> and solely focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, that leaves Dragon Age on pause for the forseeable future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Darrah said, he believed BioWare should next focus on remakes of the series' first three games, starting with Dragon Age: Origins — something that had previously been discussed, but has not happened for various reasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I honestly think they should do — I don't think they will, but they should do — a remaster of the first three [Dragon Age games]," Darrah said. "One of the things we pitched at one point — pretty softly, so pitched is a massive overstatement — was to retroactively rebrand the first games as if they were a trilogy, call it the Champions Trilogy, so you have these larger-than-life heroes... maybe you do that as a first step.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You shine them up, you re-release them — probably remaster, probably not a remake — see what happens and maybe go from there," Darrah continued. "I'm very curious to see... in a weird, twisted way, the Mass Effect franchise and the Dragon Age franchise are in similar states. They have a trilogy of games that are pretty well received, and then a fourth game that's less well received. I'll be curious to see what Mass Effect does with Mass [Effect] 5 — how does Andromeda fit in there?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early trailers for Mass Effect 5 acknowledge the Andromeda galaxy, and there is an expectation among fans that the events of the sci-fi series' fourth entry will be a part of the game's narrative — even if the main thrust of the game's story will be back in the series' original Milky Way setting, following more familiar characters, alien races and themes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So why hasn't a Dragon Age remaster happened? Well, according to Darrah, a lack of enthusiasm within publisher EA is at least partly to blame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"EA's historically been — and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly — they're kind of against remasters," he continued. "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly-traded company to seemingly be against free money but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The other problem is, Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do. To some degree unknowably harder, maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder?" Darrah pondered. "One of the very earliest things for Joplin [BioWare's initial version of Dragon Age 4, before its multiplayer reboot, and before the subsequent single-player version that became Veilguard] was, 'let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented, and just uplift them, and pay them to do a remake of Dragon Age: Origins.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other words, Darrah is saying that during the early days of development on Dragon Age 4, a remake of the franchise's first chapter was discussed — even if it never moved forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were lots of pitches around, is there a way to bring Dragon Age: Origins forward? And depending what you do, a remaster you kind of get Dragon Age 2 for free, a remake you don't."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the difficulties in working with Dragon Age: Origins already-archaic engine made it a harder task than remastering Mass Effect (whose entire trilogy was made in the more commonly-used Unreal Engine), and hiring people to either work on a remaster within BioWare or work with an external team was a tough sell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can't really remaster Dragon Age externally, you probably have to do it internally," Darrah said. "The studios run their own financials within themselves, and to some degree EA's stance was probably 'sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have'," Darrah said. "And it was like, we can't do it with the money we already have because we're doing all these other things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for BioWare's future, Mass Effect 5 is now in early production, but still seems to be years from release. A few months ago, we did at least get <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-wait-for-mass-effect-5-director-seemingly-confirms-returning-feature">confirmation of one particular returning feature</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

		<p>The story so far: In December 2024, Tencent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/tencents-light-of-motiram-looks-very-very-familiar/">revealed Light of Motiram</a> and everyone, and we mean everyone, said the same thing – they had ripped off Sony’s Horizon series, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
<p>The game featured a red-haired girl fighting very familiar mechanical beasts with a bow and staff, creeping through waving red grass to avoid detection, gliding with a glider, and interacting with characters wearing equally familiar costumes. They also nicked the Ghost from Destiny as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In July this year,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/sony-sue-tencent-clone-horizon-light-of-motiram/"> Sony sued Tencent</a> and the lawsuit stated that Light of Motirm is a “slavish clone” of its games, that copies multiple elements that would confuse consumers. They also reference many video games websites that noted the similarities. They asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Tencent had pitched a new Horizon game to Sony but they declined the offer. It seems that Tencent went and made it anyway, and when Sony were made aware of the clone they contacted Tencent to try to solve things without lawyers. At this point someone a Tencent decided the best thing to do was to pitch their Horizon idea to Sony again. Flabs were probably very gasted over at Sony at that point.</p>

<p>Which brings us to today, where Tencent have wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine. One of the original screenshots does remain but the protagonist is in shadow under a glider and could be anyone really.</p>
<p>The new description is very generic.</p>
<p>“Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.”</p>

<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157937/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It is testament to Konami’s back-catalogue, from an era when it was the undisputed king of the 16-Bit and 2D arcade craft, that it can muster so many extraordinary compilations. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gradius_origins">Gradius Origins</a> joins both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary</a> releases, and Digital Eclipse's wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_the_cowabunga_collection">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, as yet another essential for purveyors of fine gaming antiquities. M2, long-time Konami collaborator and the professional darlings of the porting industry, return here, adding Gradius Origins as another key entry in their expansive <strong><a href="https://m2stg.com/en/">ShotTriggers</a></strong> library.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the Switch is usually the bottom of the pile when it comes to cross-platform input lag tests. This is less an issue in 3D games, but for 2D - and especially those in the shooting game genre - it’s critical. While input lag can never be perfect, Gradius Origins feels wonderfully tactile, with M2 eking out responsiveness in ways not thought possible. Playing as uniformly close to the arcade originals as one could hope, this is a celebration of seven wonderful titles - six new, and one brand new title. And, while 1988’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_life_force">Salamander</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/life_force">Life Force</a> are technically the same game, they feature very differentiating regional and mechanical nuances. For many, the latter is considered a something of an upgrade overall.</p>

<p>For clarity, <strong>Gradius</strong> is a series built around a one-life clear, or as near enough as possible. Typically, dying in mid-to-late stages and being stripped of all power-ups is extremely difficult to come back from. Salamander, on the other hand, is a more immediately accessible spin-off series, replacing the cycling power-up menu with standard icon grabs that instantly enhance your craft.</p>
<p>Salamander does away with checkpoints, allows you to grab Option pods and weaponry back after death, and showboated back in 1985 with a wealth of awesome digitised speech. Here, M2 have provided optional in-game subtitles for this, too, present at the foot of the screen. Perhaps Salamander’s salient gimmick, and now a series staple, is that it switches dynamically between horizontal and vertical stages, prompting you to “go up” after the stage one boss. It also heralds the introduction of the Lord British ship, accompanying Vic Viper in the player two position.</p>
<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gradius (1985), Salamander (1988), Life Force (1988), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gradius_ii">Gradius II</a> (1988), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/gradius_iii">Gradius III</a> (1989), and <strong>Salamander 2</strong> (1996) are now joined by <strong>Salamander III</strong>, an all-new entry in the series, crafted by M2. The last original entry prior was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiware/gradius_rebirth">Gradius ReBirth</a> - also by M2 - released seventeen years ago on the Wii Virtual Console. To that end, Salamander III isn’t just an arbitrary bonus; for many it represents the sole reason for purchasing the collection. And, M2, clearly aware of both the responsibility and reputation, have delivered an exceptionally accurate return to Konami’s beloved franchise.</p>
<p>Salamander III kind of does it all. While it plays like Salamander, it takes boss, stage and enemy elements from Gradius. Here, Vic Viper, toting a stronger laser, and the Lord British craft a stronger Ripple weapon, are fighting back the Salamander army yet again. Both now feature a powerful Burst shot that can be used freely on a reheat timer, clearing paths through organic matter and debris. The series’ quirky 80s adventure vibe slaps a smile on your face early on, with the announcer warning you to watch out for Moai heads embedded in muscle tissue, and while the recognisable bacteria theme is present, Salamander III veers through asteroid fields, Gradius III-like sand ruins, and the mammoth techno-corridors of a superfortress.</p>
<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157940/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Graphically, it sits authentically in the pocket of mid-90s arcade games, and is a blast to play from the outset, full of urgency, adrenaline, and blazing lasers. The first loop is satisfying to work through, and surprisingly (and for some, encouragingly) easy, dishing out extra lives like there's no tomorrow. Loop two introduces more to dodge and some jazzed up enemies, and is ten minutes longer, tougher, and the only way to face the true-last-boss. You can go beyond this, but by loop four it's plain insanity in fast forward.</p>
<p>Is it the best of the Salamander series, though? No. While solid, there’s a lot in here that feels a little like a remix as opposed to a wholly original outing, perhaps drawing too heavily from past elements right down to its hitboxes and graphical stylings. Salamander 2’s stunningly beautiful, colourful, wonderful arcade chunkiness, snazzy set-pieces and boundless invention still make it the salient entry, with a deeper, more exciting risk-reward Option system. It's incredible to think that on release it was a game much maligned by an ignorant gaming press. Today, depending on shooting preferences, it's arguably Salamander's gold standard.</p>
<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157944/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Salamander III, while the draw, overshadows another delicious bonus: <strong>Gradius III AM Version</strong>, which was only shown at trade shows in Japan prior to the alpha release, and hasn’t been seen since. Well, it’s here now, and poses a very interesting curio for series fans. This being an infamously, soul-crushingly difficult game, however, one might consider dropping the difficulty or employing the rewind function to see more of it.</p>
<p>The rest of the collection, which documents the series over the years, is beautifully presented. There are accompanying storylines at the selection screen, and even a well-considered warning that Gradius III is so hard it’s likely to grind you to dust before you finish it. M2's now standard "Gadgets" are in full effect, allowing you to configure information about every on-screen detail, display hitboxes, adjust auto-fire rates, and make use of replays and online leaderboards. You can adjust screen dimensions, tweak filters, buttons, HUD displays, and, bar Salamander III - which is purposely excluded from cheat-your-way-through tinkering - utilise a rewind function at the press of a button. This now-expected attention to detail makes all the difference, breaking down each entry into not just regional variations, but also their respective PCB updates.</p>
<figure><a title="Gradius Origins Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157941/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’re encouraged to explore each variant, and footnotes on the select screen will give you a useful overview of what the key differences are. Each title features a bespoke Easy option created specifically for the collection. These exist separately to the configurable difficulty settings that were part of the arcade hardware, making Konami’s wonderfully goofy but fairly challenging space war universe all the more accessible. If that weren't enough, there are galleries full of original concept and promotional art, and music players to groove to.</p>
<p>While there’s so much glorious stuff here, one may still feel disappointed that <strong>Gradius IV</strong>, Treasure’s incredible <strong>Gradius V</strong>, <strong>Gradius Gaiden</strong>, and even M2’s own Gradius Rebirth, aren’t included. It’s difficult to complain there’s not enough here, because there’s plenty, but fans will know that many of the absentees are considered high points. Salamander III, however, does a lot to smooth over frustration in this regard.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>M2, famous for its articulate, somewhat surgical approach to porting historical code just right, has done another fine job with Gradius Origins. There’s so much polish here it positively gleams, and the overall care, bonus gadgetry and quality of life extras are all impeccably set. Salamander III is the big one, and it delivers, even if it doesn’t really push the envelope in terms of originality or visual bombast. It’s a shame there are still Gradius absentees in the list, and one day perhaps a truly comprehensive compilation will rear its head. For now, though, it’s time to saddle up and destroy the core like never before.</p></section>

			<p>Last month, Turn 10 was allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned into a Forza franchise support studio</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another round of cuts</a> at the Microsoft-owned developer. Following the dire news, fans have been wondering whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Motorsport</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> would continue being supported with new updates and fixes.</p>



<p>The official answer came a few days ago via the official Forza Motorsport account <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Dear Forza Community, we know many of you have questions about what’s next for the Forza franchise, and we appreciate the support of our incredible community. We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.</em></p>



<p>Truth be told, there were few worries about the latter game. While nearly two years older, Forza Horizon 5 was much more critically and commercially successful. The open world racing game recently launched on Sony's PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to top charts there</a>, too, showing the game's strength even four years after its original debut on PC and Xbox Series. There's little doubt that there will be a Forza Horizon 6, and according to some rumors, it may not even be that far off. </p>



<p>However, a new Forza Motorsport may be a lot harder to imagine if Turn 10 has really been turned into a support studio. In the meantime, the 2023 game just saw the reactivation of the Track Toys Tour, which has now permanently returned to Forza Motorsport alongside its associated reward car: the 2019 Porsche #70 Porsche Motorsport 935.</p>



<p>Track Toys Tour is the second Featured Tour to be re-activated in Career mode, and all four of its series, in addition to its Reward Showcase, can be played at any time. At the start of each month, Turn 10 will bring an additional Tour to the game. Up next is the Ringer Tour on September 4. This cadence will continue until all of the Tours have returned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tron Catalyst developer Bithell Games has been unable to secure funding for a new project and has laid off the “majority of full time staff”. Mike Bithell took to<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b"> Bluesky</a> to explain the situation and while it’s awful that people have to lose their jobs, at least this boss cares.</p>
<p>“Sad news today, Bithell Games, having been unable to secure a new larger scale project, is reducing in size. This means that eleven jobs are being made redundant. This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff.&nbsp; This constitutes the majority of our full time staff,” reads the post.</p>


<p>“It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We’ve fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages.”</p>
<p>“Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less.”</p>
<p>The layoffs will not affect any existing self-published games and these will continue to receive support.</p>

<p>We have always been fans of Bithell; I recall chatting with him just as his breakout hit, Thomas Was Alone, was released on PS Vita. Since then he has gone from strength to strength, moving from indie titles like Volume to games based on massive franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/john-wick-hex-review/">John Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/tron-catalyst-review/">Tron.</a> He has also has talked to us <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/interview-mike-bithell-on-distilling-the-action-of-john-wick-hex/">numerous tim</a>es, and also came to chat on the much missed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/29/podcast-the-year-according-to-mike-bithell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSA Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>We wish the laid-off staff and those remaining at Bithell Games all the best.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-early-console-comparison/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-early-console-comparison-highlights-playstation-5-pro-higher-average-resolution-xbox-series-s-compromises.1266984/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With some differences, Battlefield 6 promises to deliver a great experience on all consoles, judging from a recent early comparison based on the game's open beta.</p>



<p>The comparison, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, details the two display modes available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, Balanced and Performance, which target 60 FPS and up to 120 FPS, respectively, and highlights the differences between all console versions. As expected, the new entry in the series runs and looks best on PlayStation 5 Pro, with a higher average resolution, more particles and debris during destruction, and longer draw distances. On the other hand, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game aren't very different, with Sony's system sporting a slight advantage in terrain and particle quality. For the Xbox Series S version of the game, unsurprisingly, the developer had to make some compromises to maintain the 60 FPS target, and has thus removed all screen space reflections, reduced draw distance, and lowered the quality of lighting and shadows in this version's single display mode. Despite these differences, Battlefield 6 seems to have been optimized well on all platforms, delivering solid performance across the board.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Battlefield 6 first open beta session was held over the past weekend, and it was, unsurprisingly, a smashing success, peaking at over 520,000 users on Steam. Although plagued by <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">rampant cheating</a>, the overall consesus is definitely positive, setting the game to become one of the most successful releases of the year when it launches in a few months on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10. In case you haven't had the chance to try out the open beta, you can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/far-cry-tv-series-apparently-in-works</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/far-cry-tv-series-apparently-in-the-works.1266981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a hastily-deleted news post on the Ubisoft website, a&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development, and it sounds like it'll be taking a similar approach to the games in terms of focus.</p>

<p>The post, which is no longer available to view on the Ubisoft website, was caught before deletion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Redditor iwascuddles</a> (aww). As noted by fellow Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/comment/n7p386g/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kiribaku</a>, the show's description states that it will take the form of an anthology, with each season focusing on "a new world with a different cast of characters".</p>

<p>Beyond that, we don't know too much about how the show will work, including whether its seasons will adapt existing&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>games or whether entirely original stories will be produced for the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=aCoeyn7Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-tv-show-far-cry-6.jpg?itok=bHGxSog7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV series appears to be in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>If the post is accurate, however, then the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>show will star&nbsp;<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>'s Rob Mac, formerly known as Rob McElhenney. He also serves as one of the show's co-creators, alongside&nbsp;<em>Fargo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth&nbsp;</em>writer Noah Hawley, who will be&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>'s showrunner.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this show technically hasn't officially been announced, so a lot of these details could be subject to change. Still, the announcement seems a little too comprehensive to be fake, so I'd imagine the <i>Far Cry&nbsp;</i>TV show will be officially unveiled sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>If the show does go ahead, it'll be the first major&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>project since 2023's&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>, which served as both a loose adaptation of 2013's&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&nbsp;</em>and an homage to Ubisoft's franchises in general.</p>

<p>The mainline series itself appears to have stalled somewhat; the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/far-cry-6" rel="nofollow">last major installment</a> was released back in 2021, and since then, no official&nbsp;<em>Far Cry 7&nbsp;</em>announcement has been made.</p>




<p>In any case, if the&nbsp;<em>Far Cry&nbsp;</em>TV show is real, it's probably going to be a while before we see any more of it, so for now, you'll have to content yourself with replaying the current games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>McDonald’s running&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> promotions with its Happy Meals is no new phenomenon. Most years, the two corporations team up to include packs of McDonald’s-marked <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards in the kids’ meals, and it generally proves very popular. But recently, something else has changed: over the last year, <em>Pokémon</em> cards have become outlandishly popular, to the point <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">where they remain near-impossible to buy in stores thanks to scalpers and fanatics</a>. This mess is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-center-tcg-scalpers-journey-together-1851770342">just as bad in Japan</a> as it is in the U.S., and the ridiculous situation has spread to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-pikachu-mcdonalds-japan-happy-meal-1851786307">a simple Happy Meal tie-in</a>, causing the three-day event to be abandoned early amidst chaotic scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/"><em>Nintendo Soup</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers"><em>IGN</em></a>), things have gotten so out of control that police were called to multiple McDonald’s locations, alongside massive numbers of Happy Meals being dumped in the streets uneaten once the cards had been removed. Things got so out-of-hand that <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s Japan issued a statement</a> declaring the whole event over after just a single day.</p> <p>“We would like to inform you,” the statement begins, “that the distribution of Pokémon cards to customers who purchased Happy Meals® ‘Pokémon,’ which was scheduled for three days only from Saturday, August 9th to Monday, August 11th (national holiday), has ended at many stores due to higher-than-expected sales.” The company goes on to apologize to customers for “not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who were looking forward to the product due to the early end of distribution.” It then concludes, “Please refrain from contacting stores regarding stock availability.”</p>

 <p>This weekend’s circumstances seem likely to have been primarily caused by a unique Pikachu card contained in the packs, featuring the little mouse-thing sitting down to a fast food meal. McDonald’s sets usually feature re-used art from previous cards, making them not all that collectible, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">a bespoke Pikachu generally causes everyone to collectively lose their minds</a>.</p> <p>It seems scalpers were a large part of the problem, with individual McDonald’s stores not helping by failing to stick to a five-meals-per-person rule. <a href="https://twitter.com/hapi_tori/status/1953942557660262413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953942557660262413%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">Photos of people buying dozens of Happy Meals at once</a> were posted to social media (with what looks like plenty of unpleasantly anti-Chinese sentiment to boot), <a href="https://twitter.com/Daiyamato69/status/1954102074129658324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1954102074129658324%7Ctwgr%5E2d086785bef7b9afe7ef8b695a52e59037c66c47%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnintendosoup.com%2Fpokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos%2F">as well as pictures of many meals dumped in store doorways</a>, uneaten.

I’ve been there, taking the boy for a rare McDonald’s meal because of a recent Squishmallows tie-in, only to find the restaurant had put in some tat from a previous Disney promotion after scalpers had scooped the lot. It sucks. People ruin everything.</p> <p>However, this is emblematic of a far larger issue regarding the <em>Pokémon TCG</em><em>&nbsp;</em>of late, where massive price hikes for even modern cards are motivating scalpers to snatch everything up, while The Pokémon Company International–<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">despite repeated promises</a>–entirely fails to appropriately step up supply. Let’s hope this ridiculous bubble bursts soon.</p>

                <p>It looks like Far Cry will be the next high-profile video game series getting a TV adaptation, as Ubisoft confirmed the news on its official site before quickly deleting the post. This being the internet, nothing is ever truly deleted, no matter how briefly it's online for, and the original announcement has been preserved.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Over on Reddit</a>, those people who did manage to see the original announcement say that the show will star Rob Mac--the Always Sunny in Philadelphia actor who recently changed his name from Rob McElhenney--and he'll also produce the series alongside Noah Hawley (Alien: Earth), Jackie Cohn, Michael Garcia, and Nick Frenkel. On the Ubisoft side, Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, and Austin Dill are also attached in various roles, and the series is reportedly in development at FX.</p><p>"This collaboration is really an embarrassment of riches," Boykin reportedly said in the removed post. "Far Cry is a psychological tailspin that doesn't shy away from the darkest and most absurd parts of humanity, which aligns perfectly with FX's bold and fearless storytelling style."</p><p>It's claimed that the show will be an "anthology drama" that will set each season in a new world and with a different cast of actors attached, emulating the storytelling approach of the games. This lines up with Ubisoft's current plans to focus on its tentpole properties--Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">via a new spun-off subsidiary</a> of the company funded in part by Tencent and led by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot.</p><p>As for Far Cry, the last game in the franchise was Far Cry 6 in 2021, which received lukewarm reviews. Since then, there have been rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-wants-to-reinvent-the-far-cry-series-with-its-next-two-games-report/1100-6528543/">Ubisoft wants to shake up the franchise's open-world formula for its next two entries</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-more-than-10-years-far-cry-4-just-got-a-major-update-on-ps5/1100-6531188/">Far Cry 4 is looking pretty good on PS5</a> thanks to a recent 60fps update.</p>

                <p>Weekends are usually the busiest time for a new game release, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> was--fortunately--no exception to that rule. Once the game switched from early access to open beta, the numbers soared and Battlefield 6 reached an impressive peak of 521,079 concurrent players (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via SteamDB</a>). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-players-on-ps5-are-getting-an-exclusive-skin/1100-6533792/">A second open beta is scheduled for August 14-17</a>, and if you're planning to play on PS5, there's an exclusive skin you can claim if you choose to purchase the game later this year.</p><p>To put that into perspective, Call of Duty HQ, which includes Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, peaked at 67,595 players on Steam during the weekend, and Battlefield 6 surpassed the free-to-play game's all-time peak of 491,670 concurrent players. Console numbers haven't been revealed yet, but it's highly likely that quite a few people grabbed a free download of the beta so that they could join in on the action.</p>

			<p>At the Summer Game Fest 2025 in June, Icelandic developer Myrkur Games unveiled Echoes of the End, their debut game that had been in the works for several years. The title, a fantasy story-driven action/adventure game powered by Unreal Engine 5, is being published by Plaion (Deep Silver) and launches tomorrow on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821610/Echoes_of_the_End/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X.</p>



<p>In a fantasy world called Aema, the main character, Ryn, a swordfighter who can also wield powerful magic, embarks on a mission to save her brother from a totalitarian empire. Along the way, she partners up with Abram Finlay, an older scholar haunted by his past.</p>



<p>Ahead of this new release, we had a nice, long chat with two of Myrkur Games' founders, CEO and Game Director Halldór Snær Kristjánsson and Senior Writer Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson, to learn more about their team and the project itself.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>First, please talk about how you met and established Mirkur Games as a studio.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The three founders, myself and two others, actually met during our studies at university. We were all studying game development at the time. This was like 2016, somewhere around that time. We were in our final year and we actually met by chance: we were assigned to be a group in a game development project where we developed a small game in three weeks. During that time, we really clicked. We were working around the clock on this game; we were super passionate, it was palpable.</p>



<p>Through that period, we learned that we really liked working together. We decided to do our final project together, and eventually, we decided to form the studio together as well. At this time, the context is that Unreal Engine is still subscription-based and not yet mainstream. Everybody is still using Unity, and photogrammetry and motion capture are much less available to smaller developers, but this is changing.</p>



<p>We knew we were all headed towards this industry and wanted to work in it, but we realized at the time that the pivot happening with Unreal Engine, with availability and accessibility to hardware and software in the industry, was just a complete transformation. We had nothing to lose at that point. We were still living with her parents and could effectively take a big, long risk to pursue this dream of ours.</p>



<p>Soon after that, we started out as just the three of us, but quickly, the word started spreading to close friends and others, and we invited some people to generate ideas for the game and think about what we could be doing. Magnus joined one of those evenings, where we just sat around and talked about what kind of world we want to make, and he's kept showing up since. That was in 2017.</p>



<p><strong>Did you begin immediately working on the project that would become Echoes of the End?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We formed the studio during our time at university. We did actually work on a few different, smaller projects. We even did a VR project and stuff like that, but once we'd formed the studio, we sat down and took this long vision for this game. It's metamorphosized since, but really, we've been working through the years on different versions of this game, starting with just laying down the tech fundamentals, because making a game like this just takes so much infrastructure. There are so many building blocks that you need to put together and everything needs to click, so we started by first developing the very, very early prototypes of what we have today. We went out with a camera and scanned rocks around the city, trying to do smaller-scale motion capture, trying to build up those things, and then the basic systems of the game that take a long time to build.</p>



<p>We did that for a few years, and a couple of people joined on. Then, I believe in 2019, we had the fundamental building blocks in place, and we started building a full vertical slice for the game, which was around 20 to 30 minutes. That's probably when the game started to take shape. From there, we signed with Plaion and have been working on the game since about 2020 or 2021.</p>



<p><strong>How did you connect with Plaion and why did you choose them as the publisher of Echoes of the End?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We've been working with them for about five years now, and it's been a really good relationship. I believe we met around Gamescom, but I don't remember if we met at Gamescom. We met up with a few people there, and we had a few calls. We were talking to a lot of people back then. To us, Plaion seemed like the exact other half of what we were looking for.</p>



<p>They handled the publishing part of it because we're a new team. We're pretty green. A lot of us are pretty junior, but we're making something pretty cool. They really came in with lots of experience, both on how to get the game production down and, of course, funding for the project, which is absolutely critical, but also we got connected with a lot of good folks. It was just really obvious from the start that they were a really good match and exactly what we needed.</p>



<p><strong>You said that Plaion provided some funding. I guess that helped you expand the team, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Exactly.</p>



<p><strong>How many do you have right now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We're about 40 people right now. When we signed with Plaion, we were about 16.</p>



<p><strong><span>I read on the website that some team members</span> work in the office while others are remote, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> That's correct.</p>



<p><strong>How do you find this working for you? Some developers have gone nearly full remote, while most bigger ones are asking developers to return to the office. What's your take on this? Work from home, or work from the office?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> I would definitely say like for a project like this, because we were crafting a new IP, there was a lot of creative talking back and forth where we had to figure things out. When we started out, we didn't really have the world fully molded; we didn't have the level design of the metrics. All that stuff was just new, and then the team was also new, so it was quite pivotal for us during the period to have the majority of the team on location, just for that quick communication between the teams and idea generation.</p>



<p>They often talk about the kind of water-cooler chats where the best ideas don't come from sitting at a meeting and thinking about them, but once you stand up and go do something. I may be chatting with Magnus just on a walk, and we have this brilliant idea, and then we test that, so that's extremely valuable.</p>



<p>But we still have some remote employees in the company. We've tried to cultivate that quite a bit. They hang out in calls during most of the day, just with their team, instead of being offline the entire time. So, as they're working, it's kind of like having a coworker sitting next to you. It's optional, but most of them tend to do it. </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> They've also all been here. There's nobody who has never met the team, never spent some time here in the office, plus part of it is just a false choice for us because we live on a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic, so we kind of have to.</p>



<p><strong>I guess that was my next question. Even the remote workers are still in Iceland, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We brought on quite a bit of talent from around the world. I don't know how many nationalities the studio currently has, like it's 11 or something like that. The problem is that, like Magnus was saying, not only being on an island in the middle of the Atlantic, but also the fact that there wasn't a studio similar to what we were trying to build in Iceland before. I mean, there's CCP and there's a lot of good talent there, but the expertise that we very specifically needed for this game was just kind of impossible to find here, so we had to go abroad when we were trying to recruit people and try to reach people all around the world and that's why we ended up with this highly multinational team, which is just fantastic in our eyes. They're coming from different studios, AA, AAA studios around the world, and brought some excellent experience for the team, especially early on in the meat of the production, that I think guided us in the right way.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> To clarify what you're asking, everyone working remotely is working from outside the country. Nobody is working remotely in our studio in Iceland.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/8-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>We tend to say that Iceland plays the same role in our game that New Zealand played in The Lord of the Rings movies. The game isn't set in Iceland; it just draws visual inspiration and basis from Iceland. It's the thing we're most qualified to showcase because we know it very well and we think it's beautiful and we know the things about it that inspire us to share what is beautiful about it. And also, it is popular, it's got appeal. People come to visit here, people come to see it, and I think the idea of basing a fantasy world on a place like that, a place that is a little different from most other places you'll go, has appeal.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Got it. Talking about Echoes of the End, I understand that its world is heavily inspired by Iceland, albeit through a fantasy lens, right?</strong> <strong>What inspired that, and what did you want to portray about your country in this game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> We tend to say that Iceland plays the same role in our game that New Zealand played in The Lord of the Rings movies. The game isn't set in Iceland; it just draws visual inspiration and basis from Iceland. It's the thing we're most qualified to showcase because we know it very well and we think it's beautiful and we know the things about it that inspire us to share what is beautiful about it.</p>



<p>And also, it is popular, it's got appeal. People come to visit here, people come to see it, and I think the idea of basing a fantasy world on a place like that, a place that is a little different from most other places you'll go, has appeal. </p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> It also helps a grounded consistency, but there's definitely more than visual inspirations. For example, the Icelandic language does appear in Echoes of the End in a number of unique ways. We have different inspirations that we pulled from while still keeping in mind that this isn't real life, this is a fantasy world, and we got to set ourselves apart from the real bits as well.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> The Icelandic language is really mostly there as an Easter egg for the Icelanders.</p>



<p><strong>We talked about similarities and inspirations, but how does Aema differ from real-life Iceland, and what are the things that make it unique from other fantasy worlds that we see in other games?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> It's always a fun question to deal with because fantasy is so varied, right? But I would say it is fundamentally a low magic world. Not to say that magic doesn't exist, but to say that magic is the defining thing about it, right? The existence of magic is the fundamental point of its history and it's the reason for most of the historical events that have taken place. Thus, it is kind of the root of the story and Ryn's story as well. She's a vestige with this born connection to magic as a force.</p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Also, magic has just shaped the cultures in our game. I think we made magic pretty integral to how they employ the magic and how they build tools and weapons and stuff out of magic, so it's really built differently into the world and the backstory of the world as well.</p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> And then that also leads into the moment-to-moment experience and the visuals as well, because it trickles down throughout the entire production. But I would say the most unique things from my end are how we mix the fantasy and Icelandic elements. and the backdrop that Ma was talking about, I think that's really the main meat of EMA and what makes it appealing, to us at least.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> As we're talking about this Icelandic inspiration, sometimes I stumble upon little things that I didn't realize were inspired by being Icelandic, but there's this certain obsession with history. It's a story about characters, but the world is still defined by its past. The name Echoes of the End is chosen for a reason: it is a story defined by things that have already happened.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Echoes of the End is fundamentally a story about identity. It's a lot about Ryn struggling with identity and about Abram as well and how those struggles both mirror each other and complement each other and how, through their journey, they discover new things about who they are. The story kicks off with Ryn's father's death. And so to her, rescuing her brother is, again, part of her identity. It's: I have to be there because our father is dead, I have to save him. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you say anything about the story, or rather, its background? For example, what motivates the main character? What's going on at the beginning or shortly before that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The main story is about two people, Ryn and Abram, the companion Abram and the main character Ren, who we see on the cover of the game. Really, the meat of the game is their relationship as it develops throughout the game and their mission. In terms of the plot and the setup, we play the game with Ren, and she initially doesn't quite know this strange companion. She meets him throughout the game and is kind of forced to align with him and work with him, but the premise of the game is that Ren is on a mission that she has to go and save her brother, who gets removed from her or separated from her by this invading force, which is also looking to invade the country. So she has a two-fold mission to save her brother and stop this invasion.</p>



<p>Ryn has her own struggles to deal with regarding the powers we described before. Those are a double-edged sword in the story and not as obvious as you might think. It's a struggle for her to deal with that magic and with the connection that she has, but she's also got to learn to trust this new companion. They've got to learn to work together and build this relationship. Earlier, we mentioned The Lord of the Rings. If you think about Sam and Frodo's journey and their development and how we root for them and think about them, I think Ryn and Abram definitely can have their highs, the lows, the good moments, the bad moments, and that's really the heart of the game.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> Echoes of the End is fundamentally a story about identity. It's a lot about Ryn struggling with identity and about Abram as well and how those struggles both mirror each other and complement each other and how, through their journey, they discover new things about who they are. The story kicks off with Ryn's father's death. And so to her, rescuing her brother is, again, part of her identity. It's: I have to be there because our father is dead, I have to save him. </p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> There's no one else and she's become responsible for him. </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> I think exploring that identity of caretaker versus sibling versus friend is the personal drive of at least what kicks off the story.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking about the gameplay, you've described it as a cinematic third-person action adventure game. Would you compare it to something like the God of War reboots in terms of how it plays moment to moment?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> I would say it is definitely an action/adventure story-driven game. First off the bat, it's not a Soulslike, we get that question a lot. In terms of combat, it will definitely be familiar if you play games like God of War or Star Wars: Jedi. Ryn has a sword and that's her main weapon, but where the game sets itself apart is with Ryn's abilities. She has two key abilities that really set her apart from others. One is an ability called shift, which is a kind of an analog ability that lets you relocate objects in any direction and aim. So you could throw an enemy into an enemy, you could throw an enemy of latch objects into enemies, and it's really fun to play around with and changes every fight and makes them feel different.</p>



<p>The other hallmark ability that she has is the ability called drain, which deeply connects to the lore of the character. It is her ability to siphon health from other enemies to her. It's a channeled ability, so it's also quite tactical because if you just stand around and use it, you might get attacked by other enemies.</p>



<p>So you really have to combine those abilities together to manipulate the enemies on the battlefield to create the opportunity to strike and to use your health recovery ability, but those are really only her main kit. On top of that, there are 40 different upgrades, and many of them are actually new abilities that she will uncover on the way, allowing her to tackle fights differently. And then Abram (we have two main companions in the game, but Abraham is definitely the main one) has his own set of abilities as well that you can upgrade as their journey goes along. They get better and better at fighting with each other, comboing with each other, using Abram's abilities and your abilities to get that critical hit or combo that you're looking to do.</p>



<p>In terms of the pacing of the combat, it's definitely fast, but it's not a hack-and-slash. It is more deliberate than many other games. You have to think of every step. Do I wanna attack, or do I want to use this ability or that ability? </p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> Battlefield control is a really big part of it, controlling where you are in relation to your enemies and putting your enemies where you need them to be.</p>



<p><strong>It's always interesting with games that feature companions because some of those games have the NPCs acting on their own through AI, but in others, you can tell them what to do. How does Echoes of the End work in this regard? Can you ask Abram to activate a specific ability?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Yeah, it's a hybrid between the two for sure. We really wanted the companion to be quite able in the game, and it was really tricky because the gameplay has of course combat, but we also have puzzles and we have platforming in the game. The companion has to be able to do all these different actions, like sliding and jumping and using ropes and whichever action is in the game. The same goes for puzzles. We wanted to integrate them into puzzles both autonomously but also in a way that you can work together and build into their story to solve puzzles in the game. But in terms of combat, Abram is quite active. He will create opportunities for the player. He will trip enemies, grab enemies, set up opportunities, and you can upgrade some very, very cool abilities that will open up more of those opportunities automatically.</p>



<p>In terms of activated abilities, you do have a number of activated abilities that you can ask him to trigger at the moment that you want, so it really is kind of a healthy combination of you being able to get the most powerful abilities out of him when you think they're gonna matter versus him also being quite dynamic and creating those opportunities for the player.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> The thing that keeps surprising me when I play is the fact that all of Abram's abilities are totally divorced from everything you're doing. So you can be in the middle of a drain. You can be in the middle of any animation and you can still use Abram's abilities because he's a different guy. That sounds like such a simple thing, but that's the thing I always have to think the most about.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>We really wanted the companion to be quite able in the game, and it was really tricky because the gameplay has of course combat, but we also have puzzles and we have platforming in the game.

<p><strong>I also wanted to know if Echoes of the End has any RPG elements, like looting or upgrading gear.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> We're definitely a very small team. We're 40 people with the ambition of the game that we have. We definitely have some inklings of those elements, but the gear, for example, is something that kind of stays consistent. When you're playing Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, there's not really a gear upgrade. The upgrades primarily come through the abilities and the upgrades that the characters get. But in terms of RPG systems, I think probably one of them is the fact that you can have different conversations in the game with a companion and you can opt for different conversations and answer in different ways.</p>



<p>But you can definitely also find permanent upgrades throughout the game that will enhance different things in your kit, so there is an element of that, but it's not a strong focus in terms of like armor stats or something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Magnús Fr. Guðrúnarson:</strong> There are four character progression skill trees.</p>



<p><strong>As you just said, Myrkur Games is not a large studio. According to your playtesting, how long can players expect Echoes of the End to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> The game length is generally, I would say, 14 to 15 hours during our playtests when we get people in to try the game out. It's longer than we set out to do. One of the reasons we offer for that as well is that we have 10 main chapters in the game, and each chapter in the game actually has a distinct not only environment and visuals, but we really wanted this game to feel like an adventure, like you're traveling throughout the different biomes and seeing different parts of the world, and that's exciting on a visual level, but also on top of that, each level will have their own kind of key mechanic in the game.</p>



<p>So as Ryn and Abram are going throughout the game, once you get into a new level, we're gonna throw a kind of new mechanics at you to interface with, and that's a promise that we give out to players. Once they play the first two chapters, they'll start to realize, okay, they're switching it up every so often. The way that we talk about this internally is that Ryn is a hammer and Abram is a screw, and they're solving problems together or dealing with different things. We always throw completely different problems, and those are usually tied to the biome that you're in and the story of the biome that you step into.</p>



<p>If you see in the announcement trailer, there's quite a few of those mechanics that we kind of tease. When you step into a new chapter, you get introduced to a mechanic and then we tend to expand them and make them more complex. And also, the enemies in each chapter will differ. We have about 20 unique enemies in Echoes of the End, and then of course, the bosses on top, and those are also quite tied to the themes of the chapters. So you might see an enemy in one chapter and not in any other.</p>

<p><strong>As a quick follow-up, is there any missable or optional side content in the game, or is it just linear?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Going back to the small team analysis, we definitely wanted to make sure that our main content was the thing that we focused on, really pack everything into the main punch. We often talk about games like Uncharted in that aspect internally, kind of wanting to do an action adventure, melee fantasy, but in the kind of same setup. Uncharted also has chapters in different environments, so that's a good comparison there. But still there's stuff to explore. Some of our levels are more open, and you can miss optional puzzles, things you can find, collectibles and upgrades, and definitely optional conversations you can get with a companion. But we don't have secondary missions in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Echoes of the End is about to launch now; I assume it's all-hands on deck time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Halldór Snær Kristjánsson:</strong> Yeah, we are making sure that every minute goes into final polish and we get everything on board that we want to. It's looking really good and we're pretty excited to get it out to players and show them what we've been doing for all these years.</p>



<p><strong>Good luck, and thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>With work on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach complete, all eyes are on the next game from Kojima Productions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/">OD</a>. Also known as Overdose, OD is one of several games from Hideo Kojima and his team at Kojima Productions that we know about, and it's being made in partnership with Xbox Game Studios. Kojima has kept most details on OD under wraps, allowing the brief reveal trailer to do the talking for him and get fans of his work speculating on what he's cooking up right now. A few other details on the game have been revealed since it was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-announces-new-xbox-game-overdose-in-collaboration-with-jordan-peele/1100-6519800/">announced during the 2023 edition of The Game Awards</a>. Here's a closer look at everything we know about OD so far.</p><h2>When will OD be released?</h2><p>A release date for OD hasn't been revealed yet, and we're expecting this game to be in incubation for a few more years before it sees the light of day. Kojima, who is now in his 60s, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/">is keenly

this content!</p></div><h2>OD platforms</h2><p>Since OD is a collaborative project between Kojima Productions and Xbox Game Studios, it's likely that we'll see it launch first on PC and Xbox Series X|S. The good news is that Microsoft has adopted a new multiplatform strategy for its first-party releases, so it's possible the game will launch elsewhere, too.</p><h2>OD story</h2><p>So far, only the teaser trailer embedded above exists for OD. In true Kojima fashion, it creates more questions than it answers as the video shows off three characters from the game as floating heads on a black background, all engaged in some top-notch acting. What's really impressive here is that they've all been rendered in Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with MetaHuman--Kojima Productions had previously used the Decima Engine for its Death Stranding games--so you can only imagine how impressive things will look when the game eventually arrives.</p><p>Throughout the trailer, the characters also recite a pangram, and there are a <em>lot </em>of opinions on what it means. Is it a veiled zinger referencing Kojima's departure from Konami or just pure gibberish? Who knows, but here's the quote in full:</p><p>"The hungry purple dinosaur ate the kind zingy fox, the jabbering crab, and the mad whale and started vending and quacking."</p><h2>OD gameplay</h2><p>So what kind of a game is OD? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-his-xbox-exclusive-game-od-is-risky-and-difficult-to-explain/1100-6526769/">Kojima isn't saying much</a>, but he did mention in an interview that the core concept is "a bit risky" and that it's hard to explain. "This is a game, but it's a game like no other. I can't go into too much detail, and it's also hard to explain," Kojima said. "But it's a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games."</p><p>To be fair, Death Stranding was also hard to explain before it was eventually released, as the third-person post-apocalyptic courier game introduced some wild ideas at the time. What we do know--<a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/OD-announcement" rel="nofollow ">thanks to the official synopsis</a>--is that OD will be a horror game of sorts and that it will feature performances by actors Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier.</p><p>"A Hideo Kojima game, OD explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear--while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film," the description reads. We also know that Kojima is partnering with Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele for OD, who knows a thing or two about creating unnerving content.</p><h2>OD screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545840"></a><figcaption>OD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545840-od-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545841,1300-4545842,1300-4545843,1300-4545844,1300-4545845" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545841-od-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545842-od-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545843-od-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545844-od-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4545845-od-6.jpg"></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Getting access to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/">Nintendo Switch 2 dev kit</a>&nbsp;requires following some rather strict guidelines aimed at ensuring that a game brings clear value to the platform.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Doctre81">Doctre81</a> in a new video shared on YouTube over the weekend, Nintendo partner LynxByte Games recently shared on social media some new information on Nintendo's current guidelines for getting access to a Nintendo Switch 2 dev kit. Simply porting a game over from the original system or any format does not automatically grant publishing rights on the new system as every game, even from existing partners, must be individually approved, with approval only being given to games that showcase the capabilities of the system by taking advantage of its features, including 4K support at 60 frames per second or up to 120 FPS at 1440p resolution in docked mode, implenting GameChat and mouse controls, supporting HD Rumble 2 and GameShare and more. Besides being a showcase of the system's capabilities, any developer pitching a game must clearly outline how their title brings value to the platform by leveraging some of these features, alongside a detailed release plan.</p>



<p>Besides revealing the above details regarding dev kit access, LynxByte Games also revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 seemingly supports NVIDIA DLSS 3.1. Although the version number, nowadays, doesn't mean a whole lot, given the different components of the upscaler such as Super Resolution and Frame Generation, which are not necessarily supported at all times, it was being speculated the system used some lightweight version of NVIDIA's tech with no direct correspondence to the different versions of DLSS seen in countless PC games so this sort of confirmation could be kind of interesting for a lot of reasons, although the upscaler is not being used much, at least by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">first-party titles.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As the Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">6 million units</a>, developers are obviously very interested in releasing games for the system. You can learn more about the features the system offers and that developers need to currently take advantage of to get dev kit access by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

In hindsight, that's looking like a pretty spectacular deal right about now, with the price back up to $209.70. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I've mentioned, every other preorder for the upcoming MTG Spider-Man crossover is sold out at the time of writing. That includes the Collector Boosters, Gift Bundle, Booster Bundle, Scene Box, and Prerelease Pack. If you want those before launch, your best bet is the secondary market at trusted resale sites like, as we've mentioned, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObml7?object_uuid=6b1cce6d-b7ba-4e42-a951-c06fbfb2028f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the Welcome Decks (around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg7NJ?object_uuid=6b1cce6d-b7ba-4e42-a951-c06fbfb2028f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$30-$50 each on TCGPlayer</a> right now) that became available at the 2025 San Diego Comic Con that ran from July 24–27, with another wave of these "expected to become available closer to release later in September".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also part of July's San Diego Comic Con, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-card-reveal-spoiler-spider-verse">IGN had exclusive look at some of the first cards that will actually be a part of that Standard-legal set</a>, including five Spideys that will surely look familiar to any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse">Spider-Verse</a> fans out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WOTC has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-developer-responds-to-fears-its-only-focused-on-short-term-profits">previously stated</a> that its ongoing Universes Beyond crossovers, such as Spider-Man, Fallout, Assassin's Creed, and more have brought a huge amount of new players through the door, and recently revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day">the recent Final Fantasy set made a whopping $200 million</a> on its first day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in other Spidey news, production is now in full swing for Brand New Day, with shooting taking place in central Glasgow over the past week.
