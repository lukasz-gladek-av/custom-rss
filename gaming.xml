<p>Stellar job, Frasers Group</p>

<figure data-uuid="e149f2fb65f93"><a title="GAME" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e149f2fb65f93/game.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>UK retailer GAME has reportedly filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators in a clear sign that the firm is once again on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/frasers-owned-game-retail-signals-it-s-on-the-brink-of-collapse">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/eastmidlands/news/2106649-frasers-owned-gaming-chain-hits-pause-and-alerts-administrators">The Business Desk</a>, GAME – which is owned by Frasers Group – has appointed law firm RPC to oversee the 10-day protection period from creditor action while it considers any potential next steps. What those steps might be at this stage is unclear.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time GAME has fallen into administration – it happened before back in 2012, resulting in the closure of 277 stores in the UK and 2,104 job losses. You might remember shortly before this that several major game publishers refused to provide stock for GAME, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mass_effect_3">Mass Effect 3</a> being a particularly high-profile release that simply wasn't available at the retailer.</p>
<p>Private equity firm OpCapita purchased GAME one week after it fell into administration, subsequently selling the business to Frasers Group in 2019. Since then, standalone stores across the country have been closing down in favour of concession stores within Sports Direct. Additionally, GAME no longer stocks pre-owned games, and its reward scheme has gone the way of the Dodo.</p>
<p>To cap it off, the Basingstoke Head Office fully closed down in 2025.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on how things pan out with GAME over the coming days and weeks, but we're not wholly convinced anybody is going to be keen on saving it this time around. Nothing would thrill us more than to see GAME pulled from the brink and transformed into a thriving specialised retailer that stocks unique, bespoke physical games. But that's probably wishful thinking at this stage.</p>

<p>The Direct showcased a bunch of fun features that we can expect to find in the slice-of-life sequel, including a huge number of character customisation options, personality quirks, more design possibilities than we ever thought possible, and <em>Hugh Morris</em> — the jolly jester from the trailer that we're now campaigning to get in Smash Bros.</p>
<p>And yes, it'll all be compatible with Switch 2. Whether there are any bonus features on the new hardware remains to be seen, but hey, we're excited!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pghsml&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Moon Beast Productions, a studio founded by a group of veterans from the <em>Diablo </em>series, has announced its inaugural project <em>Darkhaven</em>, a "next-generation action RPG" that promises to offer a dynamic and reactive world.</p><p>As you'd probably expect from folks who've worked on <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Darkhaven </em>is quite similar to Blizzard's ARPG series. Moon Beast says the game "returns to the genre's roots while pushing it forward", which is a pretty ambitious goal.</p><p>According to Moon Beast, <em>Darkhaven </em>will accommodate "solo play, co-operative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms", and will be designed around all three of them. It's safe to say this one is reaching for the moon, as it were.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Darkhaven </em>isn't shy about its similarities to <em>Diablo</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The world of <em>Darkhaven </em>will apparently be "procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent", meaning that you'll be able to deform terrain and build upon it if you want to.</p><p>Moon Beast is promising seasons that change, weather that "alters combat and traversal", and world-altering events that leave "permanent scars" upon the world. We will, of course, have to wait and see just how substantial those promises are.</p><p>In combat terms, <em>Darkhaven </em>is perhaps promising a more holistic experience than <em>Diablo </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/path-of-exile-2-hands-off-preview-ranger" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ae9db8ce-ce51-4048-811d-7be0b0523331" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other descendants like <em>Path of Exile</em></a>. Since you can "jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely", combat takes on an extra dimension "rarely seen in the genre", Moon Beast says.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguingly, Moon Beast says <em>Darkhaven </em>will reject what it calls the "incrementalism common in many modern titles" in favor of a loot system that's "bold [and] expressive", with each item being "capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them".</p>
<p>At the very least, <em>Darkhaven </em>has a solid pedigree behind it. Moon Beast's staffers include the likes of <em>Diablo II </em>programmer Peter Hu and lead artist Philip Shenk, as well as Erich Schaefer, a designer on both <em>Diablo II </em>and its predecessor.</p><p>Right now, <em>Darkhaven </em>doesn't have a release date, but the devs are planning to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">launch a Kickstarter campaign</a> soon to help them bring the project into Early Access. While you wait, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wishlist the game on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[The Stream Deck-packed gaming keyboard is a monster of good ideas]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/869542/corsair-galleon-stream-deck-gaming-keyboard-review</link>
            <guid>1419658</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Corsair Galleon 100 SD didn’t just come out of the ether. The new full-size mechanical keyboard with a Stream Deck fused to its side is the result of a <em>lot </em>of things coming together over the years. Corsair’s gaming business is more refined than ever, and Stream Deck’s wide ecosystem of plug-ins makes the dedicated hardware useful to just about anyone, even if they have little interest in streaming. The fusion makes sense.</p><p>The possibilities with a Stream Deck were already vast, and the Galleon makes it easier to feel like a power user. I can turn my Philips Hue lights on and off throughout my apartment with one of its dials, and I can pause, skip, and fave tracks in YouTube Music with its buttons. I can launch <em>The Verge</em>, declutter a mess of windows on my screen into a tidy grid, and so much more with a single button press — all without taking my hands off the keyboard.</p><p>Anyway, here’s a quick history lesson on how we got here: The Galleon is the result of acquisitions and another company’s misfortune. After Corsair bought Elgato in 2018, it acquired a majority stake in iDisplay, the company that already produced tiny screens for the Stream Deck. And it’s possible none of this would have happened if iDisplay hadn’t been asked years earlier to supply OLED screens for each key of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">Art Lebedev’s groundbreaking, yet ultimately flawed, Optimus Maximus</a> keyboard, which sold for $1,490 at launch in 2008. So here we are.</p><p>The Galleon is reasonably priced at $350. Yes, you can pay about $60 for a Deck Mini and then buy a very good keyboard; perhaps both will cost you less than $350. But it’s fun to use a product that’s both a good, polished keyboard and a great bundle of customizable buttons and dials.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODY5NTYx"><p><span>$<!-- -->350</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Fused, single-cable design looks great.</li><li>It’s a good keyboard attached to the best Stream Deck.</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>It’s pricier than just buying a Stream Deck and a good keyboard.</li><li>Keyboard and Stream Deck use different software. </li><li>I wish it was modular.</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The Stream Deck integration is the big draw with the Galleon. It has 12 buttons, a non-touch screen, and two rotary dials, all of which can be customized. The LCD screen behind the keys is Elgato’s highest-resolution screen in a Stream Deck so far (it’s a 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS display). You can drag and drop commands and plug-ins through the Stream Deck app, giving you easy access to day-to-day niceties, like commonly used emoji to use during video calls, as well as more powerful integrations.</p><p>Elgato developed official Stream Deck plug-ins for several popular services, including Philips Hue, Apple Mail, Slack, Zoom, Photoshop, YouTube, Spotify, and more. There’s a vibrant community of developers who submit their own plug-ins as well. The rabbit hole goes really deep, not just for plug-ins, but for the customizable app icons you can assign to each button, and the backgrounds you can use on the larger screen. Some of them are real time-savers, like this <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/helldivers-2-stratagem-0c648333-25a0-403f-9894-22c5f6b1ff89"><em>Helldivers 2</em> profile</a> that lets you execute Stratagems with the push of a button, as opposed to frantically hammering directional keys while enemies are encroaching.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The keyboard attached to the Stream Deck is good, too, even if it’s not the center of attention here. It looks slick and subdued, with per-key RGB LEDs that can be configured in Corsair’s browser-based Web Hub app. You don’t need to use the software, but you need the Stream Deck app to get the most out of the buttons and dials. The chassis has an aluminum housing, and a large wrist pad can be attached magnetically near its bottom keys. The Galleon connects to your PC (or game console — it officially supports Xbox and PlayStation) with a single USB-C-to-A cable. If you have an extra accessory to connect, you can plug the second included USB-C-to-A cable into your PC for data or charging passthrough. Then, attach your gadget to the USB-C port.</p><p>The design isn’t that different from <a href="https://go.corsair.com/c/482924/490888/8513?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.corsair.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fc%2Fkeyboards%2Fvanguard-gaming-keyboards" rel="sponsored">Corsair’s Vanguard series of keyboards</a>. The Galleon includes gasket mounting and multiple layers of dampening. Typing sounds and feels satisfying and bouncy, yet controlled. Its MLX Pulse switches have a pronounced “thock” sound and don’t require much force to actuate. One of the few missed opportunities is making the Stream Deck modular, so that left-handed typists can easily access its buttons and knobs. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22996700/mountain-everest-max-keyboard-review-gaming">Mountain Everest Max</a> did this years ago, and it’s all the more puzzling given Corsair hired that company’s founder, Tobias Brinkmann, as the VP of its gaming division responsible for building this very keyboard. Corsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams shared with <em>The Verge</em> that it’s because development on the Galleon had already begun by the time Brinkmann was hired, and followed the statement with “Who knows? Maybe we will iterate on this. :)”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Galleon has two USB-C inputs, one of which enables a passthrough port for data or charging.</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Coming off of recently testing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/821355/asus-falcata-review-hall-effect-switches-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard">Asus Falcata keyboard</a>, which uses the longer-lasting, more customizable Hall effect switches that are both quieter and significantly faster to actuate (too fast for me until I set actuation point thresholds), the MLX Pulse feels more like what I’m used to typing on with my Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB split ergonomic keyboard. If you have a preferred switch, you aren’t locked to using Corsair’s. The Galleon supports hot swapping switches, so long as it’s a 3-pin or 5-pin switch. A tool is included to make it easy to deconstruct each switch down to the bottommost layer covering the PCB.</p><p>I’ll only ever scratch the surface of what’s possible with the Stream Deck. The device started out as a companion for streamers on Twitch, so there’s a bevy of resources — ready-made drop-in assets to make your stream look more professional, some for free, some for a fee — from Elgato and other developers. For just being a set of buttons and knobs, the possibilities with this mature cross-platform ecosystem are vast, and those who really tap into it will get a lot out of the Galleon.</p><p>Even for those who use the Stream Deck more casually, $350 for the convenience of a two-in-one product is not a terrible price. It’s a luxury I don’t think is worth upgrading to if you’re already happy with your keyboard or your current Stream Deck. If you need one of the ingredients, or both, this all-in-one, single-cable gadget is just a really cool thing.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/869542/corsair-galleon-stream-deck-gaming-keyboard-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of tinkerers working on reviving Bioware's Anthem via private servers following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-anthem-will-finally-shut-down-in-early-2026-just-shy-of-its-seventh-birthday">shutdown</a> earlier this month have now offered more insight into how that project's going so far. While a video <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anthem-private-server-experimentations-underway-as-the-shooters-subreddit-mods-rethink-retirement-plans">posted last week</a> got hopes up that a return could be relatively imminient, the group say there's plenty of work to be done yet, with the main potential stubling block being efforts to figure out the quirks of EA's Frostbite engine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This group working on trying to get Anthem back online with private servers, likely in a similar fashion to the fan-revived version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">released last year</a>, have chatted to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/">Ars Technica</a> about the current progress. The short version is that while last week's video of a basic private server setup running was a milestone, this group working out of a Discord server called The Fort’s Forge still face a big hurdle that they reckon'll dicate how the project plays out.</p>
<p>According to a team member with the handle Ness199X, the group have so far managed to break the services that make Anthem tick into three parts. There's EA’s Blaze server to handle basic player authentication, a web server called Bioware Online Services which tracks things like inventories and quest progression, and finally the Frostbite multiplayer engine which handles loading levels and tracking players in them. The video showed off "quick and dirty" efforts to emulate the first two.</p>
<p>How to handle getting the Frostbite element and its level data to work in fashion that doesn't rely on the servers EA have shut down is something the group are "exploring", but say has been complicated by Anthem sometimes behaving in quirky ways that are different to other Frostbite games. "For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do," Ness199X explained. "And we have yet to determine why." They reckon the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature" might be part of this, but at this point aren't "entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to."</p><p>As a result of that uncertainty, whether the group will be able to pull on all the Frostbite threads they'd ideally want to for a revived Anthem and how long that'll take remain up in the air. Ness199X said they're currently about 75% sure that'll be doable, and it'll dictate whether reviving the game takes "months, or less even, depending on motivation" or ends up with "the amount of work increases fairly exponentially" to the point the group might not be motivated to slog through it.</p>
<p>Either way, the group are still keen to emphasise that it's early days yet, so not to expect they'll definitely have more progress to show off or put out in short order.</p>

            <p>Do you miss the good old days of Diablo, before Blizzard’s hellish clickfest megamorphed into a live service Beezelbub owned and operated by stinky uncle Microsoft? Be upstanding, perhaps, for Darkhaven – a new action RPG from a studio founded by a trio of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 veterans, who have some questionable notions about weaponising volcanos.</p>
<p>Said veterans are Diablo 2 lead character artist Philip Shenk, Diablo 2 programmer/designer/lead Peter Hu, and the original Diablo’s senior designer, art director, and story writer Erich Schaefer. So, <em>actual</em> veterans then, rather than people who sneezed in the presence of some Sanctuary concept art while delivering pizza to Blizzard North, back in the 90s.</p><!--more-->

<p>Darkhaven is an isometric (whatever that currently means) dark fantasy affair set in a world of fallen empires, overgrown ruins, and supernatural predators. Some kind of terrible evil is on the up and up, and it’s your job as Chosen One (or Chosen Several, if you’re playing co-op) to bop it on the hooter.</p>
<p>If Darkhaven is channelling the auld Blizzard North energy, it also sounds somewhat like a 4am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a> playthrough, in that the world is chaotic and modifiable. </p>
<p>“Designed for solo play, cooperative adventures, and high-stakes PvP-enabled realms, Darkhaven is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world,” explains a press release. “Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.”</p>
<p>As Shenk summarises in the press release, “we’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create.” </p>
<p>It doesn’t sound like it’ll hinge quite as heavily on gear quality and progression as classique Diablo, either, let alone the wildly incontinent loot walrus that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a>. Characters will be able to “jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre”, with victory in combat “not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness”.</p>
<figure>

<p>“It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore,” Schaefer comments in the press release. “It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.”</p><p>There is plenty of gear to acquire, but they’re apparently rejecting the “incrementalism” of certain modern ARPGs in favour of “bold, expressive loot – items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them”, as the press release continues. Hu comments that “finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p>
<p>All of which is very much speaking my language, as a serial incremental loot hater, with the caveat that they’re funding it via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds">Kickstarter</a>, ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">a Steam early access release</a>. I am newly suspicious of crowd-funding, in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enormously-disappointing-darkest-dungeons-boardgame-port-is-dead-but-red-hook-are-giving-away-game-files-to-backers">the Darkest Dungeon boardgame bullshit</a>. Still, as Diablo successors go, this one has more of a pedigree than most.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-game-key-cards-size-nintend-2000664117</link>
            <guid>1419643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">Game key cards</a> were one of the more deflating aspects of the Switch 2’s launch year. While digital downloads are now ubiquitous, some of Nintendo’s most devoted (and loudest) fans still prefer physical games for the purposes of collecting or preservation, or just because they look nice. A cartridge that doesn’t actually have the game on it just isn’t the same. Yet despite all the uproar over the issue, a new survey suggests people are buying game key cards anyway.</p> <p>Deku Deals, an aggregator of sales and discounts for physical games, shared some new data about its users that shows game key cards are selling just fine. “Of the 1,070 Deku Deals users who have added one or more third party physical releases to their collection, 735 of them own one or more Game-Key Card titles,” the site wrote in <a href="https://www.dekudeals.com/articles/are-switch-2-owners-buying-third-party-game-key-card-releases">a new blog post this week</a>. There’s even a pie chart to show the disparity.</p>

 <p>The site also listed the most popular Switch 2 games among its users. Six of them are game key cards (the bolded ones):</p> <ul> <li><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></li> <li><em><strong>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</strong></em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li> <li><em><strong>Star Wars Outlaws Gold Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter 6 Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Persona 3 Reload</strong></em></li> <li><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em></li> </ul> <p>Of course, it’s worth noting that the&nbsp;<em>majority</em> of Switch 2 physical games are actually game key cards. So if you’re someone who just buys a bunch of games in general, or are one of those hyper-fans who wants to own all of the Switch 2’s launch library, you’re going to end up with a bunch of game key cards by default. At the same time, the survey at least suggests that people who would buy physical in the first place are still opting for game key cards&nbsp;over just buying the game digitally from the eShop. That’s probably the sentiment that led Nintendo to launch game key cards in the first place.</p>

 <p>At launch, companies reportedly only had access to the 64GB card sizes for physical Switch 2 games. The extra expense is what steered so many to opting for game key cards instead. <em>Hades 2</em>, for example, is $50 for the Switch 2 cartridge but only $30 if you buy it in the eShop. Other companies have just eaten the loss on margins. That’s seemingly what CD Projekt Red did with<em> Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

 <p>Fortunately, it sounds like that is no longer a restriction for companies moving forward. <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games accidentally leaked that more cartridge sizes had become available back in December before <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">deleting its post on the subject</a>. Game key cards will still be necessary for some games. The file size for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> on Switch 2 is too big to fit on a cart, and developers for open-world games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have argued that loading data off of a physical cartridge is too slow to yield decent performance. We’ll see if players stop opting for game key cards if and when they become less prevalent.</p>

              <p>Because Nintendo couldn’t do anything as normal as just release a trailer with a press release, today greeted us with a&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> Direct, in which the Japanese giant revealed lots more details about its upcoming threequel to 2009’s DS Mii-based social sim game <em>Tomodachi Collection</em> and its 2014 3DS sequel, <em>Tomodachi Life</em>. We’ve picked out the most interesting news, and you can watch the whole Direct below.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi</em> games are all about the social lives of Miis, the user-created characters best known from the Nintendo Wii, that still sort of persist today. Think&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, but with much bigger heads and far more complicated interpersonal issues.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664132">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>An all new Mii creator</h2> <p><em>Living the Dream</em> isn’t reinventing the wheel, once again having you design your own residents for an island by designing Miis. You can either have the game generate their look by asking you a series of questions, or make use of a far more in-depth character creator than we’ve seen for Miis in the past. There are ear-shape choices for the cartoon creations.</p> <h2>You can choose ‘dating preferences’ and be non-binary</h2> <p><em>Tomodachi</em> fans have long been hoping that this third entry in the series will finally introduce same-sex relationships, and a promise that during character creation you can choose “dating preferences” confirms that. You can also choose to be non-binary as well as male or female.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000664136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664136"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664136">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can medal in everyone’s relationships</h2> <p>At one point during the Direct we see the player character deep in thought in her house. She’s musing about matchmaking a local doctor with a resident jester, and you can suggest a talking point to help the pair hit it off. In this example, the unlikely subject of “monster trucks” is typed in, and despite this they do manage to find something in common.</p>

 <h2>There’s a bonkers news network for the island</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000664129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664129"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664129">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>MiiNews Network provides updates for what’s going on in and around the island on which all your Miis live, although it appears to be providing some deeply surreal offerings. Clips shown in the Direct include a trip through time for a research crew searching for the origins of life, and news of a “nearby faucet that appeared to be dispensing Patrick,” as a man emerges from an outdoor tap. Which makes it slightly more grounded and realistic than Fox News.</p> <h2>You can make your house look like a supermarket</h2> <p>Home decor is of course available for making your Miis’ homes unique. The options on offer seem pretty vast, with the Direct showing off that you can make a house look like a supermarket with shelves packed with produce, or a library complete with hundreds of books.</p>

 <h2>Patrick seems like a douche</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000664127" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664127"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664127">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Patrick appears as the generic love interest during the trailer. But look at him. What a douche. Thankfully, after he turns down our main character, she instead starts to notice just what a lovely chap that jester Hugh Morris seems to be. She’s in love! But she matched Hugh Morris with Dr. Winters! LOVE TRIANGLE! And they force him to choose! Well, gross, and it serves our character right that she completely loses out.</p> <h2>Oh lord, you can design your own ‘animals,’ buildings and clothing</h2> <p>Who’s ready for an island made of dicks? That’s what Nintendo’s apparently inviting with the ability to draw your own creations and have them appear in the game. This can take the form of a pet (a pet dick), designs on clothing (a dick shirt), or the ground and outsides of buildings (dicks dicks dicks).</p> <h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> is out April 16</h2> <p>Well, there’s not a lot to add there, other than to note that it’s coming to both the original Switch and the Switch 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Chill Climbing Game Is So Frustrating It Sent Me Into A Mini-Crisis]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cairn-review-game-bakers-haven-impressions-furi-2000664121</link>
            <guid>1419637</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>How many chances should you give a game before you decide it’s just not clicking with you? That’s what I asked myself every time I booted up the Game Bakers’ </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>. As a huge fan of the studio’s past work with its romance RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/haven-is-a-sci-fi-rpg-about-being-in-a-long-term-relati-1838020224"><i><span>Haven</span></i></a><span>, I was eager to put on some climbing gear and see what the team had waiting for me at the top of its rocky mountain. But each time I turned the game back on, I felt like I was struggling to get a foothold in its dense, cumbersome climbing.</span></p> <p><span>A lot of games make you climb, but few have ever required me to be as intentional with every single movement as I scaled their cliffs. In most games that have you climbing and doing cool parkour tricks, simply pushing your analog stick in the right direction will have your hero pretty autonomously accounting for every gap between handholds, with the developer having painstakingly crafted a path for you to cross that miraculously accounts for where the character’s feet are going to go as you reach for your next conveniently placed grip. </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>, meanwhile, makes you move all four of heroine Aava’s extremities independently, which is what makes the game challenging, and often maddening.</span></p>

 <p><span>I spent my time with </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> methodically charting a course up the side of a cliff, hoping that by the time I reached the halfway point I’d have somewhere for both feet and both hands to rest, lest I find myself tumbling down a chasm after my limbs grew weak from all the exertion. Much like in real rock climbing, your climbing in </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> rapidly oscillates between stretches of breezy momentum as you effortlessly climb and find places where your hands and feet can comfortably sit, and very sudden roadblocks. Encountering these, you&nbsp; only have so much time to figure out how to proceed before Aava’s shaky legs give out from under you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>’s control scheme can be awkward to navigate, with you having to swap between the various limbs you’re controlling at any given moment, and your view of them often obscured by Aava’s torso in the game’s behind-her-back camera angle. Even when it highlights her limbs as you pivot between them, their positioning can get so wacky as you’re climbing that it can be difficult to tell whether you’re controlling her right arm or her left leg. Aava’s body contorts to ascend the side of these mountains, and when precise movement is so core to your progress in this game, even the slightest moment of obscurity can turn a mostly frictionless scale into a quick fall back to the start of a climb.</span></p>

  <p><span>Movement is clunky in </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>, and movement is what you do in this game. Even when Aava is standing on solid ground, the weight of her climbing gear makes her sluggish to pilot, so simply stepping along a flat surface requires the same kind of measured attention as deciding which chip in the stone to reach for next. You’re not really meant to run up to the side of a cliff and just start crawling up the side of it. Every path you endeavour to climb must be meticulously planned, often from below, and I can imagine how that kind of slow, thoughtful movement could click for someone more patient than I, but </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span>’s dedication to emulating the full-body workout of rock climbing can’t get out of its own way.</span></p>

 <p><span>I sometimes think about how video game control schemes can never truly capture realistic movement on an intuitive, sensory level. As much as we become accustomed to the clicking of buttons, the clanking of sticks, and the swerving of a gaming mouse, they are still approximations of real-world movement, an imperfect translation of how our bodies navigate physical space and experience sensory input. VR allows for the closest approximation, and even it can’t replicate the feeling of a gun’s kickback or punching a bad guy in the jaw. </span><i><span>Cairn</span></i><span> is going the extra mile to try and recreate the feeling of having to independently account for your entire body at any given moment, in a way that we often take for granted when we’re just walking through life. Climbing requires you to be aware of everything from your toes to fingertips. The game’s attempt to replicate that is an admirable one, but the gap it tries to bridge between how the human body moves and how a video game character does feels like it doesn’t quite meet in the middle. What’s left is something that rewards a level of patience I don’t think I have anymore. I’ll just keep my feet firmly planted on the ground for now.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Meta’s recent earnings report revealed that its virtual reality division lost over $19 billion in the last year. </p>



<p>Earlier this month, Meta announced it would scale back its gaming presence, laying off 10% of Reality Labs staff. This led to the supposed cancellation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/harry-potter-vr-game-canceled-by-meta-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter VR game</a>, as well as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-likely-canceled-after-meta-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Arkham Shadow sequel</a>. Now, a new report reveals just how much they have lost in this business. </p>











<p>According to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a> report, Meta’s latest <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-302673127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> reveal that its virtual reality division incurred a $19.1 billion loss in 2025, up from a $17.7 billion loss the previous year. Of this total, $6.2 billion was lost in the fourth quarter alone. Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned that the company will focus most of its investments on “glasses and wearables” for the Reality Labs division moving forward.</p>



<p>The CEO stated that there will be an increased focus on Horizon, Meta’s VR social ecosystem, trying to make it a “massive success on mobile.” The goal is to turn virtual reality into a profitable ecosystem. Zuckerberg also mentioned that losses are expected to remain similar this year; however, he believes that the losses in 2025 are likely to be the “peak” and will gradually decrease thereafter. Interested readers can find the complete statement below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years. I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.”</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/more-than-3-years-later-nintendo-just-added-health-bars-to-splatoon-3-and-fans-have-mixed-opinions</link>
            <guid>1419628</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has added health bars to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> more than three years after the game's release, prompting a mixed reaction from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Nintendo dropped an unexpected update to its inky shooter threequel, which originally launched for the original Switch back in September 2022. Alongside a new "Aura Flow" feature and other tweaks, the patch has notably added health bars — something which has come as a huge surprise to fans of the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch notes published alongside the game's 11.0.0 update, Nintendo announced that it would now be possible "to see an opponent's remaining health when they've been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from the surprise of such a major change being made so late in Splatoon 3's life, it's that latter sentence that has left fans with confusion. Splatoon has always featured a visual representation of damage without the need for health bars — how splattered in ink a character is — and health pools in general are typically quite low, with most weapons splatting foes in three or four hits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is an important part of Splatoon gameplay, of course, but only one component — as matches revolve around coating maps with ink to establish territory control. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You'll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they've taken damage," Nintendo continued. "Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you've teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you're not familiar with."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">adding a health bar after the games update cycle finished like a year ago was certainly a choice <a href="https://t.co/glOvo4bme6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/glOvo4bme6</a> <a href="https://t.co/P1ZMDIA022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/P1ZMDIA022</a></p>— sunny 🍓 corbeau posting (@sunnydr0pdraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnydr0pdraws/status/2016077198583615687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Health bars are even funnier when you consider Splatoon came up with a unique way to have health bars diegetically - by having the enemy getting covered in ink, that's the stuff that makes the game special," wrote one fan, <a href="https://x.com/eiectrodev/status/2016192013218050373?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIectroDev</a>. "Correct me if I'm wrong but it really took the Splatoon developers three games and over ten years to add visible health bars," noted <a href="https://x.com/thinginator90/status/2016117231747584386?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thinginator90</a>. "The minds of Nintendo devs never cease to amaze."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This health bar is so ugly im so sorry i hope we can toggle it off," added <a href="https://x.com/candy_draws_o_o/status/2016155014897508654?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">candy_draws_o_o</a>, one of many fans to complain about how basic the health bar looks. (And no, you can't toggle it off.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's update also added "Aura Flow," a gameplay feature that rewards competitive play — splatting multiple enemies in quick succession — with a burst of area-covering ink, plus a 30-second buff to speed and other stats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I hates this and the health bar update," said <a href="https://x.com/kidatoasobou/status/2016306947281031216?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KidaToAsobou</a>. "It just makes Splatoon a more aggressive/competitive game. [Splatoon 3] already did that by making the maps smaller forcing players to fight more but this only further incentivizes people to attack the enemy team rather then inking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's perhaps unsurprising to see a negative reaction to such changes from fans who have become used to playing Splatoon 3 a certain way for so long. But this only further begs the question of why Nintendo is adding these features now, years after launch. By way of an answer, several fans have suggested the possibility that Nintendo is now testing ideas it is experimenting with ahead of a new iteration of Splatoon, examining feedback and using Splatoon 3 as live gameplay environment to see how player behavior is impacted. "Testing splatoon 4 features I reckon," wrote <a href="https://x.com/pejic839/status/2016193004537524368?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pejic839</a>, "like when they added online to Super Mario party as a test for Superstars."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for the Splatoon franchise will be Switch 2 single-player spin-off Splatoon Raiders, which will expand the series with a more story-orientated entry. As for Splatoon 4, while another game in the franchise feels inevitable, there's no word on that yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But what about New Vegas?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Episode 7 of Season 2, The Ghoul meets Maximus, and he uses the Cold Fusion diode that Maximus stole from the Brotherhood to power up the machine we saw back when Cooper met House in a flashback on the top floor of Lucky 38. The big terminal boots up, House appears on screen and says: "Well hello, old chum."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This led to a theory that New Vegas’ "The House Always Wins" ending was canon because that’s the only ending House survives. But in a new interview with <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet said that’s not the case because what we’re seeing here is yet another version of House that needed the diode to exist.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Characters and Factions</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It did seem to us like a version of himself powered by cold fusion would be sort of the ultimate possible incarnation of Robert House," Robertson-Dworet explained. "And as someone who is interested in robotics and artificial non-biological versions of selves, it made a lot of sense to us that this would've been something that he would've developed and sort of be the ultimate version of him. I've always seen it as something that allows for many players' experiences to have happened, but still Robert House had this other version of himself, that he was always ready to create and what he needed was the diode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Entertainment Weekly then asked if this is in fact House's final <em>final </em>form, and Robertson-Dworet declined to properly answer. "That's an interesting question,” she said, keeping her cards close to her chest. “I'm not answering that, but I'm very intrigued by the question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robertson-Dworet did go on to tease The Ghoul’s bargain with House, which Episode 7 sets up, and its impact on the much-loved character’s future. "He's just given House what he wanted after 200 years,” she said. “He's finally given him the thing that he's most desired. And the question, of course, is what will he get in exchange? He obviously is looking for his wife and daughter, and what will he find?"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Events</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Walton Goggins teased that Episode 8 will finally resolve one of the burning questions fans have had since Season 1, Episode 1: how did his pre-war character, Cooper Howard, come to be at that birthday party with his daughter, right as the bombs fell?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in Season 1 was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party,” he said. “Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are now on the final episode of Fallout Season 2, which, given Season 3 is already confirmed, will no doubt pose just as many questions as it answers.

    <p><span>First new entry in the Tomodachi Life series in more than 10 years.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a></em>, the first new entry in the <em>Tomodachi Life</em> series in more than 10 years, will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on April 16, <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [23,491 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260129403327/en/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1021708"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><p>In the <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> game, players can create Mii characters based on family, friends and anyone they can imagine, and have them inhabit a vibrant, eclectic island where almost anything can happen. Customize Mii characters right down to their personalities, little quirks and living spaces, then see what weird and wonderful things they’ll get up to. Give them an occasional nudge to divulge what’s on their minds, help them solve life’s problems, cultivate their friendships and more. In this game, time passes the same way as the real world, so try and drop in on your Mii characters daily as they continue to live their best island lives!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022377"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>See below for more detailed information on the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Mii Characters With Character</strong> – In <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, players can fully customize and envision Mii characters as family, friends and more. Your experience can differ based on the Miis you create as residents, so feel free to experiment and grow your island population!</li><li><strong>Create Many Miis</strong> – There are two ways to create Mii characters: Choose “Get Help” to answer questions about their facial features, or “From Scratch” to select from various face types, hairstyles, eyes and more. There are many parts to choose from, some of which are new to this game, and you can create even more imaginative looking Miis with robust face paint options, too. After that, you can customize their name, height, body type, gender, voice and aspects of their personality, including how quirky they are, their energy levels and more.</li><li><strong>Help Residents Connect</strong> – Once created, Miis will need some help getting on their feet. One way to do this is to bring various residents together. Drop Miis near each other and different situations might play out: They may discuss their favorite foods or bond over their love of monster trucks. Once acquainted, the Miis will be able to interact on their own. You can also have up to eight residents live together as roommates, and they’ll react differently when sharing a home. With multiple Miis under one roof, some unexpected dramas may unfold!</li><li><strong>Visit Island Shops and Facilities</strong> – Help Miis discover their favorite eats and culinary curiosities at Fresh Kingdom food mart; pick up a range of everyday attire and out-there outfits at Where &amp; Wear clothing; revamp rooms and living spaces at T&amp;C Reno home supply (there are even rooms for Miis who dream of sleeping in a supermarket or a library!); shop for reasonably priced items that change depending on the time of day at the Marketplace; gather island decorations at Quik Build amenities; tune into the MNN news station to keep up with the Miis and everyday happenings on the island; and stage a fun photo op for Miis at Foto-Tomo photography and more.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Palette [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/palette">Palette</a> House Workshop</strong> – Create a wide range of elements at this artsy workshop to further enliven island life! Design pets for Mii characters, draft up custom drinks, sketch a resident’s favorite TV show, decorate a special item of clothing, draw the exterior of a house and ground tiles, and go wild by creating original items for your island, too.</li><li><strong>Make Your Island Yours</strong> – Change up your island’s aesthetic with landscape items, such as trees, plants, benches, vending machines, bouncy playground rides and more. Move shops and houses around, expand areas of land, and more based on suggestions from residents or personal preference.</li><li><strong>More Ways to Customize</strong> – And add some flourishes to Mii characters by gifting them little quirks that can give them even more individuality, like poses they may strike, how they enjoy their food or having them toss and turn while they sleep, for example. You can also gift them favorite phrases to spice up their sentences. Try finding little quirks that fit each Mii!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

Through the AI, it felt as if I could connect with everyone around the world and wondered if we could use these cards to create something new.

            <title><![CDATA[Cairn Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/cairn-review/</link>
            <guid>1419583</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Cairn is a single player, story focused, survival game about climbing a mountain. You won’t be leaping from platform to platform, or swinging round a sledgehammer to propel yourself and your cauldron, though. No, you’ll actually be climbing, moving each of your limbs one at a time to grab handholds and wedge into cracks to scale an entire mountain. It’s not a small one, either, and it’s already populated by the remains of those who have tried and failed to reach the summit before you. It’s a dangerous situation that, somehow, becomes incredibly relaxing and meditative once you get used to it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cairn begins, as it must, with a quick tutorial. It’s essential in spite of the fact that you can easily infer the basics. Walk up to a wall, press the button, and you’ll start climbing. From there, it’s “just” a matter of moving your hands and feet, one at a time, to handholds, footholds, crevices, cracks, ledges, and whatever else you can find. Then keep going.</p>


<p>If you were Nathan Drake, you could easily spot a yellow-marked perfect route, scaling the walls like a spider-monkey, but for the more mortal character that you’re playing as, you can expect the camera to zoom in slowly and the edges of the screen darkening as your stamina drops and lactic acid builds up in your muscles. It forces you to quickly adjust to a more tenable position or fall into the abyss. How quickly your stamina drops depends on how good your handhold is, how your body is oriented, how much weight a limb is holding, and so on. You can prop yourself against a smooth wall with one foot if you’ve got a good grip elsewhere, but if you try to scale a completely smooth wall by itself, you’re going to fall almost immediately.</p>


<p>Thankfully there are a few tools to help you avoid the inevitable fall to your death. You have Climbot, a little robot that follows you around, managing your rope and gathering your self-screwing pitons when you finish a climb, and only sometimes getting in the way. Those pitons are pretty handy too, self-screwing into the rock and allowing you to attach a rope, release and recover your stamina. They also means that if you fall, you’ll be hanging from that point and only missing a chunk of health, instead of being impaled on some sharp rocks below.&nbsp;The pitons can break if you mess up the mini-game when placing them, two broken pitons can be recycled into a working piton by Climbot whilst camping.</p>
<p>The Climbot and the pitons are the really important tools, but there’s plenty of other things to think about as well. You also have water, for drinking of course, as well as a tub of chalk. The chalk is useful when you need a bit of extra grip for a riskier climb, granting you enhanced grip with your hands for twelve whole grabs, which can really make the difference. You also have climbing tape, which protects your fingers and improves your grip, and must be replaced regularly or your fingers will become bloody, damaged and worse at gripping rocks.</p>

<p>Of course these things are not unlimited, and this is where the survival elements come in. You’re managing resources, thirst, hunger, and temperature all in addition to actually climbing. The mountain is dotted with resources and you’ll want to find them because starvation, thirst, and hypothermia are just as happy to kill you as gravity is. The climbot can compost items you don’t need into chalk, water can be found in natural pools, falls, and so on, and tape and pitons can be found lying around or on expired climbers. You’ll also find a bunch of food, whether from plants growing or packaged things like coffee, oats, dehydrated soup, just left behind by others.</p>
<p>Most of these can also be processed, cooked, or infused into other things whilst you’re camping. That bag of oats and some sweetened goat milk can be combined into some porridge, you can find some coffee and get yourself a warm drink that gives you energy, or infuse your water bottle with dandelion. All of the food and drink has some effect, whether improving your grip strength, warming you up, or stopping a meter from decreasing for a bit, so they’re really essential even beyond just needing to eat and drink. Cooking ingredients is one of three reasons why you’ll always be looking for the next camping spot as you climb, the others being that resting restores your health, and that they’re also save points.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot to consider, and it is. In fact, I was initially a little overwhelmed by the hunger and thirst bars as I had barely found any food. After a while though, once you’ve got a hang of things and gathered a few things to stave off the hunger, the game becomes incredibly relaxing. Sure, you’re hanging over the edge of a mountain, but it’s a very pretty mountain. In fact, the game is very good looking, with a highly detailed, cel-shaded style. The environment is genuinely stop-for-a-minute-and-gawp gorgeous, though you and the few people you meet through the course of the story all look quite strange to say the least. It’s not just any mountain either, it’s one that was also populated at one point by troglodytes – a word I’ve now discovered means someone who lives in a cave. You’ll find not only notes and background information lying around, but parts of the mountain are carved and styled around where they used to live. It looks incredibly impressive, especially when you’re actively climbing it. I also found a night club in a cave complete with some thumping music. It’s quite a varied sort of place.</p>
<p>The main story itself is kind of strange. Following a woman called Aava, a famous mountain climber, climbing the notoriously unclimbable Mount Kami. Suffice to say the story didn’t go where I expected it to, other than up the mountain. It’s genuinely emotional as your reach the end, and I was taken aback by how impactful it was. Cairn feels like a way for some of the developers to try to express why they, personally, really like mountain climbing. A small but nice touch is that, once you’ve finished the story, you can reload your save game and follow your entire route up the mountain, which for some vaguely nerdy reason is quite satisfying.</p>

<p>There are a few issues in the way. First of all, whilst I appreciate how generous it is, Aava can be twisted and bent into positions that the human body is simply incapable of, especially whilst climbing, like a high altitude contortionist, which isn’t a profession. She can also clip through rocks as well, as can the rope that’s attached to her, and even Climbot itself, which also occasionally likes to move where you’re trying to climb, blocking you from seeing the handholds. There is also the spectre of frame rate drops on PS5, which initially only happen when you look up at the entire mountain, but become pretty temperamental everywhere. None of these really affect gameplay much – frame rate hiccups really only impact the piton mini-game as quick reactions are only needed if you’ve messed up, but they are there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station lets you upgrade your handheld gaming system, such as the Steam Deck or ROG Ally, or other USB-C-enabled devices, into a full desktop-style experience. You simply place your handheld device into the foldable stand, connect the docking station with a single cable, and immediately gain access to a display, a wired internet connection, and additional accessories. The stand’s design keeps the handheld device’s rear vents exposed, allowing proper airflow and cooling during both use and charging. A compact, low-profile base lets you easily position the docking station below a monitor or near the edge of a desk without overwhelming your work surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/">You can purchase the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station on Amazon for $40, which represents $20 in savings, or 33 percent off its original price of $60.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A handy dock to keep your Steam Deck and accessories on</h2>
<p><span>The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock’s adjustable, foldable stand uses two hinges to give you a comfortable viewing angle for your handheld gaming system. The front lip prevents the device from being pushed too far forward during button presses, while the open rear panel ensures adequate airflow around the system’s exhaust vents. When you are finished using your handheld system, the foldable stand allows you to quickly store it in a bag or drawer.</span></p>
<p>The HDMI port on the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock lets you display games and applications on a full-size television or computer monitor using a single cable. The docking station supports resolutions up to 4K at 60 Hz on compatible monitors and TVs, delivering clear image quality and smooth motion at higher refresh rates. Whether you are running games full-screen or using part of the display, video output gives your handheld system a much larger canvas to work with.</p>



<p>The four USB ports and two memory card slots turn the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock into a versatile accessory and storage hub for peripherals and media you already own. Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, along with a USB-A port and a USB-C port, allow fast data transfers from external drives, while the two USB 2.0 ports let you connect a keyboard, mouse, or wireless dongle. The dual memory card slots let you transfer photos, videos, and other files directly from memory cards without needing a separate card reader.</p>
<p>Built-in Ethernet connectivity and Power Delivery are designed to give you greater reliability than relying solely on wireless connections. Gigabit Ethernet provides a direct wired connection to your router, helping improve stability for file transfers, cloud saves, and online multiplayer gaming. Up to 100W of USB-C Power Delivery also allows multiple devices to charge simultaneously.</p>
<p>Beyond handheld gaming systems and portable devices, the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock works with most USB-C-enabled tablets and computers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6939/">At a sale price of $40, down from $60</a>, the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock 9-in-1 USB-C Docking Station offers a clean, organized way to store your handheld system, expand available ports, and simplify your cable setup.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-not-releasing-last-gen-consoles/</link>
            <guid>1419568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26</a> is finally moving to the modern era. According to the game’s ratings page on the ESRB website, WWE 2K26 will no longer release on last-gen consoles.</p>



<p>That means those only playing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are seemingly out of luck.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-esrb-page-gives-a-bit-away">The ESRB Page Gives A Bit Away</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A visit to the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41019/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s page</a> on the website mentions a release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>. That lines up with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-releases-in-march-available-nintendo-switch-2/" id="172294" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what had been previously reported</a> on the status of the game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reported in the past that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" id="170633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Island</a> mode was set to come to PC this year. With it only being on current-gen systems and PC, it now makes sense as to why. </p>



<p>2K Sports has yet to officially confirm this, so it could be a case of just missing the systems. That said, with it so close to the game’s March 13 release, it’s highly likely that what’s on the ESRB website is accurate. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 is expected to have a number of improved features and even some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new and returning match types</a> this year. One of the game’s main modes, Showcase Mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also feature current World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk</a>. Other features include the Draft in Universe mode, a revamped reversal system, intergender matches in MyFACTION, and more. </p>

    <p><span>Kickstarter campaign coming soon.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Moon Beast Productions" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/moon-beast-productions">Moon Beast Productions</a>, a studio founded by <em>Diablo</em> veterans Philip Shenk, Peter Hu, and Erich Schaefer, has announced <em><a title="Games > Darkhaven" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/darkhaven">Darkhaven</a></em>, a dark fantasy isometric <a title="Genres > Action [3,351 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,983 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> that “returns to the genre’s roots while pushing it forward with a fully dynamic, persistent world.” It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [25,368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced, but it will launch first in Early Access. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> is coming soon. <span id="more-1021761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Moon Beast Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Darkhaven</em> is a dark fantasy isometric action RPG set in the aftermath of a great and final collapse of civilization. <a title="Companies > Ancient [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ancient">Ancient</a> empires have fallen, their ruins reclaimed by wilderness, monsters, and predatory supernatural forces. Players are heirs to a legacy of power that is the last hope for this dying world. As eldritch evil worms its way into the world to feed on its remains, it falls to these few to bring the land back from the brink of death.</p><p>Designed for solo play, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [368 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,839 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s, and high-stakes player-versus-player-enabled realms, <em>Darkhaven</em> is set in a procedurally generated, fully dynamic, and persistent world. Terrain and structures are deformable and buildable, allowing players to dig through earth, tunnel through dungeon walls, drain lakes to uncover buried ruins, redirect lava flows to reshape battlefields, or rebuild shattered fortresses. Seasons change, weather alters combat and traversal, and world-altering events leave permanent scars. Every action contributes to a shared, evolving history.</p><p>Combat in <em>Darkhaven</em> enhances the balance between stat progression, build choice, and player skill. Heroes can jump, climb, swim, dash, and traverse the world freely, introducing a new layer of action and skill rarely seen in the genre. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a> is not just a function of stats, but of movement, timing, and terrain awareness, dramatically expanding the “action” at the heart of <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,946 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a>.</p><p>The game’s itemization and progression philosophy draws heavily on the originators of the action RPG genre, Diablo and Diablo II. Rejecting the incrementalism common in many modern titles, <em>Darkhaven</em> embraces bold, expressive loot—items that feel powerful, sometimes surprisingly so, and capable of redefining builds rather than merely optimizing them.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021759"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,” said Moon Beast Productions co-founder and chief creative officer Erich Schaefer in a press release. “Movement is fun. Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers anymore. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an action RPG.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and president Peter Hu added, “Great itemization is about possibility. In <em>Darkhaven</em>, we want items that open doors, gear that makes you stop and rethink your build, your strategy, or even how you play the game. Finding something powerful should be exciting and inspiring, not something that gets smoothed out into tiny percentage gains.”</p><p>Moon Beast Productions co-founder and CEO Philip Shenk said, “We’re incredibly excited to finally reveal <em>Darkhaven</em> and open its Steam page. This project represents everything we’ve learned about ARPGs over the last two decades, and what becomes possible when those ideas are combined with modern technology. We’re building a world that remembers what you’ve done, bears the scars of your victories and failures, and tells stories that only your playthrough can create. With the community’s support, we’re ready to bring <em>Darkhaven</em> to Early Access, which will allow us to continue to build the game into the incredible experience we all want it to be.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was initially announced back in 2021</a>. In May of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time". </p>
<p>Then, last year, Barone assured his fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">he is "committed to not working on Stardew Valley" until he's "done with Haunted Chocolatier"</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/haunted-chocolatier-will-have-a-larger-world-than-stardew-valley-creator-confirms">Barone revealed that "the world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley"</a>, but otherwise word on the anticipated release has been somewhat slim.</p>

<p>That has changed now, though, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">Haunted Chocolatier blog post</a>. Here, the solo developer said he had "been very productive lately", and Haunted Chocolatier is indeed alive and well. While he did admit it is "taking a while" to get everything finished, he said there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons," Barone wrote, before going to on "debunk a few myths and false assumptions" he had seen making the rounds.</p>
<p>First off, he assured everyone he will not be abandoning Haunted Chocolatier. He added even if he did decide to move on from his next game, he wouldn't be adding any unused content to Stardew Valley, as they "are separate games".</p><p>"It doesn't even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it's not the same 'engine' as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley," he explained. He furthered that when he is working on Stardew Valley, he is "not thinking" about Haunted Chocolatier, and "vice versa". This means he would "wouldn't 'test something out' in Stardew Valley" for Haunted Chocolatier. </p>
<p>Speaking of Stardew Valley, he is also working on a new update with "additional ideas for how to improve it", so there is something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Finally, Barone addressed Haunted Chocolatier's release date. We still don't have one, alas, but Barone doesn't sound too concerned about that really. "The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date," he explained.</p>
<p>"The game will come out when it's done."</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

<p>After being announced back in the March 2025 Direct, Living the Dream has since cropped up again at the September showcase with a 'Spring 2026' release date. It looks expectedly silly, but we still have very little idea of what <em>new</em> stuff it will bring to the table over its 3DS predecessor.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we won't have long until we find out. The Living the Dream Direct promises 20 minutes of info, kicking off on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent) at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>It's a game all about friendship and community, so it feels only right that you can watch along with us below. The Direct will kick off in just a few minutes, so grab yourself a beverage and get comfy, things are about to begin!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tcl-40-smart-tv-crashes-to-all-time-low-and-doubles-as-a-pc-monitor-for-less-alexa-built-in-apple-airplay-compatibility-2000663944</link>
            <guid>1419526</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is your living room in need of a new TV, or do you want a screen for your bedroom to enjoy your favorite shows while snuggling in the blanket? Prefer a smaller screen and not looking to shell out big bucks on the upgrade? The TCL 40-inch Class S3 TV checks all those boxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/">Currently, this modest-sized TV is going for just $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 21% off its usual $190 price tag</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen this screen go in a long while, and placing your orders today can also help you skip delivery charges altogether. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been looking to add a new screen to your entertainment setup, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6938/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>The 40-inch size is pretty decent. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is ideal for bedrooms and smaller living areas where you don’t want the screen to take over the entire wall. With this one, you’re getting an elegant edge-to-edge glass design for that modern look that blends effortlessly into any space.</p>
<p>The 1080p full HD resolution delivers a bright, sharp, and detailed picture quality, which can bring any content to life. There’s also a direct LED backlight for better brightness uniformity and picture performance compared to edge-lit TVs, which adds to the immersive experience. Whether you’re catching up on the latest crime thriller on Netflix or streaming a nature documentary, you’ll experience breathtaking detail with exceptional color accuracy. Yellow won’t turn into neon, and shadows stay visible instead of turning black. The latter is especially helpful when you’re playing a game on the TV, as it helps you spot enemies hiding in the dark easily.</p>



<p>You’ll also never be out of content to watch, thanks to the built-in Fire TV. This TCL screen comes with all the popular streaming platforms – like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more – preinstalled. There’s support for Spotify too, which makes it easy to vibe to your favorite songs in the background as you finish house chores. Most of these platforms, however, require a monthly subscription. Looking to cut back on those? No sweat. Free options such as Freevee, Pluto TV, Tubi, plus live channels, are available too. Maybe start the day by catching up on what’s happening around the world with live TV, and then wind down at night with an episode of your all-time favorite show. All is possible, and that too, without cable.</p>
<p>Navigation is made easy with the Alexa voice remote. It lets you search and launch content both manually and using your voice. For instance, when you’re not in the mood to press some buttons, you can say something like “Alexa, launch Netflix”, or “Alexa, show me the latest horror movies on Prime Video”, and your command will be answered in seconds. Additionally, AirPlay compatibility lets you share videos, photos, and music, and more to the TV from your compatible iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>There are more features to appreciate here, but to wrap it up, if you’re looking to grab a new smart TV without breaking the bank, this 40-inch TCL TV deal makes the jump easy. Just be sure to act before it’s too late.</p>
