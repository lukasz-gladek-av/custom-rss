            <p>
I think my big problem with the proliferation of Soulslikes as a genre is twofold: one, that so many games get labelled as such despite not being such, and two, they're all much too similar. There might be mechanical differences, but there's no big thing that clearly sets them apart from what FromSoftware already does so well, not even an aesthetic overhaul. That's part of why I quite liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>, and why I'm curious if cautious about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>.
</p>
<p>
RPS' own James got to go <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-a-first-person-soulslike-work-playing-napoleonic-parryfest-valor-mortis-suggests-oui">hands-on with the game not too long ago</a>, and despite only getting to try out a tutorial and the game's first boss, he did feel that it's a game potentially worth keeping an eye on, first-person combat and all. The only problem is, I'm not James! And neither are you, but I'm sure you, like me, would possibly like to give Valor Mortis a try to get your own verdict on what a first-person Soulslike is, well, like. This is where I come in again to tell you that you can do that, actually, because there's a <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/">playtest you can sign up to right now</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's not particularly clear if everyone that does sign up will get to try it, but it's worth a shot if you're even remotely interested. Apparently the playtest, which runs from October 6th to October 13th, will feature the game's first chapter. That includes a mini-boss and a proper boss, and a taste of the upgrade tree and level progression. In any case, as James also notes, the devs behind it also made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, a quite good first-person action game or so I've been led to believe, so perhaps there's not much to worry about. 
</p>
<p>
Valor Mortis doesn't have an exact release just yet, but it is supposed to be releasing in 2026. Let's see if that comes to fruition in this delay ridden era we live in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-blops7-skins-goofy-crossover-turned-down-deals-bf6-grounded-2000628200"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is set to launch this November. And, surprisingly, a decade after the PS4 and Xbox One’s launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-price-release-date-switch-2-dev-kits-call-duty-2000617983"><em>BLOPS 7</em></a> is still arriving day one on the aging machines. According to the devs making the next entry in Activision’s blockbuster franchise, the old consoles don’t force them to hold anything back, and <em>Call of Duty </em>is still played by a “shocking” amount of people on those platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/treyarch-address-concerns-black-ops-7-was-held-back-by-last-gen-consoles-3256130/">In a new interview with <em>Dexerto</em></a>, Treyarch’s senior director of production Yale Miller and associate design director Lawrence Metten addressed fan concerns that developing<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;for the now 13-year-old PS4 and Xbox One was holding the game back and limiting what the studio could do on PC and current-gen hardware. According to them, that’s not the case at all.</p> <p>“The way we’ve talked about it always is, you should never be thinking about old-gen for the features that you’re designing,”&nbsp; Miller told the outlet.</p>

 <p>Instead, the team builds the game for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and then makes it work on the older machines. This sometimes leads to features not making it onto PS4 and Xbox One, a disappointing decision for last-gen players, but one that the studio is willing to make.</p>

 <p>“[Theater mode in <em>Black Ops 6</em> was] something that we knew we wanted to do,” said Metten. “We can’t support it on old-gen. That’s not a reason not to do the feature. We’re gonna bite the bullet and disable it on old-gen.”</p>

 <h2>Why <em>Call of Duty</em> is still launching on PS4 in 2025</h2> <p>As to why Activision is still developing <em>Call of Duty</em> games for the decade-old machines, the answer is obvious but still surprising: In 2025, there are still a lot of people playing these games on older consoles. Miller didn’t share specific numbers, but told <em>Dexerto</em> there is a “shocking number of people” playing new <em>Call of Duty</em> games on PS4 and Xbox One, and this apparently helps with matchmaking, giving them more players to work with.</p>

 <p>“It made sense for us to [bring<em> Black Ops 7</em> to last gen], and we could,” said Miler. “There are straight-up, like, graphical features and things that you just won’t see, but we feel like that doesn’t necessarily break the experience. And, obviously, there’s performance and other things that are not gonna be as good, but that’s it. It’s just players.”</p> <p>While that makes sense, I can’t help but feel like it might be time to move on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">especially as EA’s upcoming <em>Battlefield 6</em> is doing that and cutting PS4 and Xbox One loose</a>. However, while both are military shooters, they offer very different experiences and demand different things from the platforms they are available on.</p> <p>Still, if <em>CoD</em> is so scalable and flexible, I do wonder why the team isn’t, as far as we know, working on a Switch 2 port of <em>Black Ops 7.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055">Perhaps they also struggled to get dev kits</a> ahead of Nintendo’s console launch earlier this year? Or maybe somewhere deep inside the massive entity that is Activision-owned studios, someone is tinkering with <em>Black Ops 7</em> on Switch 2 right now. I wouldn’t bet on it, but maybe you like to gamble?</p>

                <p>Starbreeze has announced a new subscription program for Payday 2 DLC. The Payday 2: Subscription, as it's called, gives players access to dozens of DLC packs for a fee of $5/month or $20 for six months--the latter represents a savings of 33% compared to paying monthly. There is no annual subscription offering, however.</p><p>The subscription comes with access to more than 65 DLC packs for Payday 2, adding things like more heists, weapons, and cosmetics. Subscribing isn't taking over as the only way to get the DLC, however, as the game's DLC packs remain available to buy individually. </p><p>Starbreeze boss Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-launches-payday2-subscription-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the aim with the Payday 2 subscription is to "give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game." The subscription is only available on Steam.</p><p>Payday 2 originally launched in 2013. A sequel, Payday 3, came out in 2023 but was marred with significant server issues upon release. Reviews for the game also didn't come in too strong, and remain "Mixed" on Steam compared to "Very Positive" for Payday 2.</p><p>Payday 2 appears to be preferable to Payday 3 for fans, as the older title has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thousands more daily players </a>than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the newer one.</a></p>

              <p>Sony was probably saving this announcement for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219">September State of Play</a> but it’s leaked ahead of time. According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/cette-pepite-fera-partie-des-jeux-du-mois-doctobre-2025-du-playstation-plus-essential-60568">Dealab’s billbil-kun</a>, October’s big PS Plus game is <em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p> <p>The survival horror GOTY contender came out two years ago next month and catapulted <em>Alan Wake</em> into the ever-expanding Remedyverse following the success of <em>Control</em> before it. The mind-warping metanarrative will be part of the Essentials tier, meaning everyone who has even the cheapest PS Plus subscription option will be able to download and play it as long as they stay paying members of the service.</p> <p><em>Alan Wake 2 </em>follows FBI agent Saga Anderson as she investigates a cult responsible for a string of murders in Bright Falls. Coming out 13 years after the original, the sequel takes place that long after the original, too, picking up where the prior game’s narrative threads left off and only getting way weirder from there. If you’re planning on giving <em>Alan Wake 2</em> a spin next month, you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve completed the original game first.</p> <p>The first game is available to revisit via a remaster released a couple years back. The good news is it’s currently on sale <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01924_00-AWREMASTERED0001">for just $5</a> on PS5 and PS4, but you only have another day to claim it at that price. The sale ends after September 25.</p>

It weighs only 1.67 pounds and is 0.27 inches thick. Designed to be used in any lighting environment and to reduce eye strain, the screen has anti-glare coating, DC dimming, and blue light reduction with (optional) automatic brightness adjustments.</p><p>As mentioned, the NXTPaper button on the side of the tablet lets you seamlessly switch between the three modes: Regular, Color, and Ink. The regular mode is for watching movies, playing games, and other activities you'd use a conventional Android tablet for. Color mimics electronic ink tablets like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft-Signature-Edition/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a> and is geared to artists as well as readers of visually oriented digital media like comic books and graphic novels. Ink mode is the traditional e-ink display option for reading (think <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0CFPP8C33?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a>).</p><p>The 14.3-inch NXTPaper has a MediaTek Helio G99 processor and Android 14 OS. It's equipped with 256GB of flash storage and 8GB RAM, with an additional 8GB of expandable memory. The 10,000mAh battery fully charges in two hours; battery life varies depending on which mode you're using, but it compares favorably to most regular Android tablets due to the large battery size.</p><p>The NXTPaper has two front cameras (13MP and 5MP) and an 8MP camera on the back with 2K video support. For sound, it's equipped with four stereo speakers and supports private listening with Bluetooth or wired headphones.</p><p>The bundle comes with a flip case that doubles as an adjustable stand and TCL's proprietary T-Pen stylus with 4,096 pressure levels and a magnet that attaches to the case.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">TCL NXTPaper 11-Inch Android Tablet Bundle (Gen 2)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FG7FRDPL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">64GB: $200 (was $250) | 128GB: $250 (was $290)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The 11-inch NXTPaper tablet that's on sale actually has a slightly better display, as it uses TCL's 4.0 screen tech--the 14.3-inch model is a 3.0 display. The electronic ink modes are a bit crisper with improved clarity, and it has better blue light reduction features. The 11-inch screen has a 1920 x 1200p resolution.</p><p>The Gen 2 model also has AI features such as smart voice memo, writing/speech assistants, and the ability to Google questions by circling an object on screen with the stylus. </p><p>Two different configurations are on sale.

Some customers will be eligible for an additional 10% off; you'll see it as a brand promotion on the store pages. Another benefit of the Gen 2 model is that it has a microSD card slot that supports up to 1TB microSDXC cards.</p><p>Both models have a MediaTek Helio G80 processor and run on Android 15. The Gen 2 has 8GB RAM with 8GB of expandable memory. The battery is a bit smaller at 8,000mAh and it only has two cameras: 5MP front and 8MP back. It also has two stereo speakers instead of four. </p><p>Both configurations weigh 1.14 pounds and are 0.28 inches thick. The bundle deals include the same style of flip case as the 14.3-inch model as well as the same T-Pen stylus.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders-are-live/1100-6534929/">The Fantastic Four: First Steps Limited Edition Steelbook Preorders Are Live</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-editions-limited-edition-restock-amazon-walmart/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Limited Edition With Lenticular Art Up For Grabs During Launch Week</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-mario-kart-deals-available-at-amazon/1100-6534885/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle In Stock At Amazon With Same-Day Delivery</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">Save On All Four Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Switch 2 Amiibo At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-batman-movie-and-tv-series-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-deals/1100-6533035/">Batman Movie And TV Box Sets Are Cheaper Than Prime Day Prices At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-amiibo-accessory-preorders-new-releases-2025-at-amazon/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Direct Switch 2 Preorders At Amazon - All New Games And Amiibo</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/">Rosalina's Storybook From Super Mario Galaxy Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Animula Nook is a stunning debut title from LilliLandia Games that sees players shrink to the size of a toy to explore a miniature world. Players control a shrunken, customizable character living on the desk of a bedroom.&nbsp;</p><p>The upcoming free-to-play game follows the blueprint of titles such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley as players explore the room to collect resources, such as coins, buttons, raindrops, and sunlight, to build various structures. Animula Nook’s impressively rendered world, resembling a toy playset, looks fantastic both graphically and artistically.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvaGN-R2ntc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvaGN-R2ntc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Everyday objects such as milk cartons and teacups can be turned into homes, restaurants, and shops. You can then decorate these structures with furniture and other types of decor. Although your settlement begins on top of a desk, it can be expanded to reach the windowsill, cabinets, and even a vivarium. LilliLandia Games promises the game features intuitive tools to make crafting and arranging objects as easy as possible. Gathering resources involves cute actions such as using a vacuum to suck up sunshine from flower patches, hugging creatures like ladybugs, or climbing flower stalks to shake resources from them.</p><p>Animula Nook’s toy-like world is full of similarly tiny characters to meet and befriend, from other humanoid buddies to more whimsical creatures. You can grow bonds with residents, and if they like you enough, they may share their personal stories and even move to your town. Animula Nook can be played alone, but it will also feature online co-op and cross-platform multiplayer.</p><p>“In this world, ordinary details can turn into extraordinary memories,” says LilliLandia Games in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3767320/Animula_Nook/">Steam post</a>. “The smallest things can tell the biggest stories. Animula Nook is about finding joy in little wonders and writing your own story — freely, in your own rhythm.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Animula Nook has no release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Switch 2, PC, and Mac.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/24/shrink-into-a-cozy-miniature-world-in-stunning-life-sim-animula-nook]]></content:encoded>

<p>The free-to-play hero shooter went on to receive one final content update in April, adding a new Support Hunter to the fray at no additional cost — which was quite the feat, considering how microtransaction-based the whole thing felt at launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qtkvlg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>834k</span></a></p>

<p>Being a hero shooter released in 2024, the writing may have been on the wall for Hunters right from the start, but our reviewer (that was me, hello!) still had a good time with it. It didn't do anything to reinvent the wheel and, as we said, the microtransactions were strong with this one, but any Star Wars fan looking to scratch that hero shooter itch will find a lot of fast and frantic fun under the surface.</p>
<p>Hey, with just one week to go, it can't hurt to hop into a game or two, can it?</p>

            <p>
Anyone fancy taking a journey across space? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/daedalic-reveal-story-driven-star-trek-voyager-strategy-game-in-which-you-can-betray-everything-janeway-ever-stood-for">Last month</a>, Daedalic Entertainment announced it is publishing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" from developer gameXcite. It was only a quick reveal though, so I'm sure they were quite Xcited to reveal a first look at gameplay in a trailer earlier today.
</p>
<p>
As you can probably gather, this is an adaptation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>: Voyager specifically, but the whole big thing isn't just a strategy game laid over the top of the show's main plot beats, it's being able to enact "what if?" type scenarios. How this manifests in gameplay terms looks quite involved. For starters, there's the ship management. This looks quite a lot like Fallout: Shelter, where you have a whole bunch of different blocks that you can build different types of rooms in for your crew to go about their business in.
</p>

<p>
Then you've got your space combat, which is a bit harder to take stock of from the trailer. It looks like you'll have different abilities you can use to fend off baddies, with a cooldown stopping you from spamming them. I think you may also have to keep an eye on specific parts of your ship from getting too damaged, but I can't quite tell exactly truth be told, it's only a short bit of the trailer.
</p><p>
Aside from that, you can also use different members of your crew to solve specific missions, and you'll have to make sure you choose the right members to do so as they all have their own pros and cons. And then there's some very '90s FMV looking bits where you can choose alternate story paths from what looks to be classic episodes (I don't know, I'm not a Trekkie, feel free to shout at me if none of them look particularly classic).
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">here</a>.

                <p>Earlier this week, Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">shared a new look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, the studio's upcoming horror game for Xbox Games Studios. Director Hideo Kojima is so committed to making this game scary that he apparently tried to scan a real ghost for the game.</p><p>"For OD, I want to go around, all over the world where [there] are scary kind of places," Kojima said at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6CaAu3T7l0%20reported%20by%20GamesRadar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond the Strand event</a> this week, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-wants-to-scan-a-ghost-into-od-but-he-already-recorded-the-ghost-in-his-studio-and-thats-why-we-went-to-the-shrine-together-with-microsoft-to-make-sure-the-game-isnt-haunted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "I want to scan a ghost for the first time and I want to get an award for that."</p><p>Speaking through a translator, Kojima went on to  explain that there was supposedly a ghost in one of the rooms scanned for the game, and he suggested that subsequent cracking sounds in the studio's building may have been the spirit following them home.</p><p>"Maybe the ghost was there, but she's no longer there anymore," related Kojima. "But anyways, and that's why we went to the shrine together with Microsoft to make sure that we have a safe build of the game."</p><p>The cracking noises mentioned by Kojima were incorporated into the OD preview, which featured Sophia Lillis' character in a creepy building as she encountered unsettling images before a ghostly apparition came up behind her and grabbed her. The trailer also had a few teasers about the game's story that were hidden by redacted lines of on-screen text.</p><p>Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer will co-star in the game alongside Lillis, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1970349454239957011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kojima Productions has confirmed</a> that the game was created with Unreal Engine. GameSpot assembled some of the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/od-see-90-images-of-kojimas-terrifying-new-xbox-game/2900-7069/" data-ref-id="2900-7069">OD screenshots</a> into a gallery.</p><p>OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC. There's no word yet on a possible PlayStation 5 edition.</p>

<p>We know what you're thinking, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> is indeed already available on the Switch 2. It was a launch game, in fact!</p>
<p>We don't blame CD Projekt Red for putting out another trailer, however, because it really does a good job in highlighting the Switch 2's versatility and how many control schemes are supported by the game. You've got gyro aiming, mouse compatibility, touchscreen support, and more – it's pretty incredible.</p>
<p>So if you're on the fence about Cyberpunk, then maybe this new trailer might give you the nudge you're looking for. If not, then consider checking out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">9/10 review</a> in which we called it "a remarkable launch-day port for Nintendo's new console".</p>
<p>Oh, and it's also one of few titles on the Switch 2 that has a proper on-cart physical edition. So if that's important to you, then you know what to do.</p>
<p>What a game, man.</p>

<figure><a title="Hades II" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ad3040c80e608/hades-ii.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, the long-awaited follow up to Supergiant Games' roguelike masterclass, launches on Switch and Switch 2 this week on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Our own review is still in the works, but don't worry, it'll be here very soon. In the meantime, a whole bunch of outlets have gone live with their own verdicts on the game, so we thought it might be wise to collate just a few of them here and hopefully give you a flavour of its overall quality.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's dive right into it...</p>
<p>First up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-review">IGN</a> awards Hades II a rare 10/10 and calls it Supergiant's "best work on nearly every level":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How do you even sum up something as beautiful, special, memorable, and admirable as Hades 2? There is no one out there doing what Supergiant does as well as it does, and this exceptional action roguelite is some of this team’s best work on nearly every level (which is an astonishingly high bar to clear). It's the type of video game that reminds me why I love video games so damn much. The art is breathtaking, the characters are captivating, the combat is fast, fun, endlessly varied, and tactical, and the music is spectacular. May moonlight guide us. All of us."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-review">Eurogamer</a> provides its own perfect 5/5 score and simply calls Hades II "epic":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I've pushed past the credits and am onto the hunt for the 'true' ending, now, and I am still being surprised by what can still be found tucked into the creases and folds of Hades 2. Supergiant's visionary approach to storytelling and roguelike design has not suffered at all from the success of Hades: it merely emboldened it. That the studio can still dole out the surprises after how rich and textural Hades was, and that I still find myself floored by the ambition, the detail, the art, the technical prowess, and the willingness to cede control to players some 60-plus hours in is miraculous. Maybe it's witchcraft. Maybe it's magic. Either way, it's epic."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/hades-2-review-switch-2/">Destructoid</a> delivers its 9.5 verdict and definitively calls it a "perfect game for the Switch 2":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just like its predecessors, <em>Hades 2</em> is a perfect game for the Switch 2. In just about a week of hands-on time with the 1.0 release, it’s become my most-played game on Nintendo’s new console in its three-plus months since release, and I don’t see that changing any time soon with a couple dozen hours already invested. At $30, this game is a steal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/72565/hades-ii-switch-2-review">Nintendo World Report</a> says that the game surpasses its predecessor in "a number of ways" in its 9/10 review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will take me dozens more hours to see all of what Hades II has to offer, and that’s not even considering some specific endgame challenges it adds after you complete your first run. I am fully invested in squeezing all of the story juice from this delicious fruit, and that’s primarily due to how masterful the gameplay feels. Moving, dashing, attacking, and casting are all incredibly satisfying, and it’s rare to see any video game so skillfully combine gameplay with aesthetic and story. Without a doubt, Hades II lives up to its predecessor, and surpasses it in a number of ways. While it can at times be overwhelming in terms of collectibles and crafting materials, there are also so many ways to enjoy the experience, through options like God Mode and Aim Assist, or just grinding out in-game achievements and other unlockables. Ultimately, my first complete run through the first Hades signalled the end of my time with that game, but for the sequel, it felt more like I was just getting started."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/hades-ii/">RPG Fan</a> delivers a score of 90/100 and says that the new entry definitely lives up to the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So does <em>Hades II</em> live up to the original? Absolutely. It retains much of what made the first title great while offering a different kind of gameplay. With <em>Hades II</em>, Supergiant Games proves that even Zeus can’t claim a monopoly on lightning striking twice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hades-2/">VGC</a> is slightly more critical with its 4/5 star review, noting that Hades II doesn't have the same thematic weight of the first game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a sequel, Hades 2 is ambitious, and delivers one of the most satisfying roguelite experiences in years. Yet, it can’t escape the shadow of its predecessor, and in trying to add every idea possible to amplify its scale, the story ends up losing the trademark weight of the studio."</p>

              <p>A CG-rendered trailer for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/pubg-mobile">PUBG Mobile</a>‘</em>s next big update appears to confirm previous rumors that Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be appearing soon in the popular mobile port of the battle royale game. But it also features Sega’s mascot fighting… Skibidi Toilets?</p> <p>On September 24, <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838">Sonic Hotspot on Twitter posted</a> what appears to be a real trailer for a yet-to-be-announced or confirmed Sonic crossover event in the long-running <em>PUBG Mobile. </em>This was spotted and s<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonicstadium.org/post/3lzlv3hy5o22u">shared by<em> SonicStadium.org</em> on Bluesky.</a> The pre-rendered event trailer shows Sonic the Hedgehog fighting a massive Skibidi Toilet character. Here’s the leaked trailer, and sorry in advance. I was going to link a YouTube re-upload of it, but that has since been removed. Hmm..</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/BaLCNi5eAV">pic.twitter.com/BaLCNi5eAV</a></p> <p>— Sonic Hotspot (@Sonic_Hotspot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sonic_Hotspot/status/1970848502566850838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Skibidi Toilets, <a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-skibidi-toilet-song-dafuqboom-tiktok-explained-1850660405">which were created as part of a now massively popular YouTube animated series of shorts</a>, were already <a href="https://x.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1970548836260069598">announced</a> to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> later this month, so it’s no surprise they are popping up in a leaked trailer. And Sonic has been rumored to be coming to <em>PUBG Mobile</em> for a few months now. Sega’s beloved mascot was <a href="https://www.topuplive.com/news/pubg-mobile-sonic-collaboration.html">even teased last month</a> in an official <em>PUBG Mobile</em> post promising six new collaborations. So that’s also not a big surprise for fans, but a nice confirmation that he’ll be here soon. However, I don’t think anybody was expecting Sonic’s reveal to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-outfit-costume-spirit-halloween-kids-1851637121">Skibidi Toilets</a>.</p>

 <p>There is something deeply depressing about watching Sonic fight a <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-venture-times-square-ad-skibidi-toilet-meme-1851561388">Skibidi Toilet</a>. It feels like my fears that all of pop culture will one day merge together into <a href="https://kotaku.com/iron-giant-multiversus-wb-smash-fighting-game-superman-1848945122">a single giant, boring blob of content</a> are coming true, and faster than expected. Everything is becoming <em>Fortnite</em>, and because all of this crossover slop is making companies millions of dollars, it’s unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p> <p>And so, that’s how we end up in a timeline where some silly videos made using the Source Engine have become a massively popular IP that has attracted the attention (and money) of <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-tv-show-real-youtube-1851603676">Michael Bay</a>. Sonic, you deserve better. <a href="https://kotaku.com/skibidi-toilet-joe-biden-colbert-late-show-clip-meme-1851496589">We all do.</a> Yet, here we are.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/be-the-last-person-on-earth-in-kentum-which-launches-on-november-6th/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Imagine the world 10,000 years from now. Depending on your own perspective it could range from a place filled with futuristic cities with space travel being the norm, while for others you may imagine that humanity has been wiped out. Well, Kentum is for those of you who thought the latter as this is a world where you play as Kent, the last human alive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kentum - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUalylbx8PQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Kentum, Kent wakes up from a 7000 year nap to discover that he is in the year 10,000 and that he is alone aside from his robot companion. Kent is not one to sit around and mope though, as he goes out to gather resources and build a base to live in. The world is a dangerous place filled with creatures and dangers within the environment. Scanning and collecting resources including from animals, plants, and minerals is key to survival to create items that helps Kent survive. Or not. Luckily, Kent gets cloned every time he dies so death is a bit of a nuisance and nothing more. The full features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survive… or Not! You’ll Be Cloned Anyways:&nbsp;</strong>Even though Kent will be revived endlessly, that doesn’t change the fact that dying is a major drag. You’ll need to gather and hunt for food, find new recipes, and polish your cooking skills. Building your own farms and vivariums is your ticket to a steady source of nourishment.</li>
<li><strong>Explore, Scan, and Catalogue:&nbsp;</strong>Discover the wonders and the oddities of a vast, ever-changing world filled to the brim with fascinating flora, fauna, and climate events. Classify every animal, plant, and mineral in order to help you survive the passing seasons.</li>
<li><strong>Craft it to the Limit:&nbsp;</strong>Use every material at your disposal to build your base. Start small by turning bone and wood into coal, machine scraps into sheets of metal, and slowly but surely grow your base into a full-blown resource-generating machine that can rival any factory in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Home Base of Your Dreams:&nbsp;</strong>Expand your home base and create an automated system to allow you to streamline and optimize your productions while you are off exploring.</li>
<li><strong>Traverse Exotic Locales in Style:&nbsp;</strong>From vibrant jungles to desolate ruins, traverse post-apocalyptic Earth with your hoverboard, hang glider, grappling hook and more. It is up to you to maneuver with equal parts adventure and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentum launches on November 6th for PC, Xbox Series XS, PS5 and Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-the-mario-movie-was-okay-at-best-but-i-cant-wait-for-the-sequel.1307406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ac7586943680/mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> from Illumination was… well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/movie-review-the-super-mario-bros-movie-a-fun-ride-that-substitutes-story-for-spectacle"><em>okay</em> at best</a>.</p>
<p>It got a fair bit right, like the excellent visual presentation and delightful Easter Eggs throughout its 92-minute runtime. But a weak script, baffling casting decisions, and reliance on licensed music over iconic tracks from Koji Kondo resulted in a middling experience that I wasn’t too keen to watch again.</p>
<p>Alas, I did watch it again – many, <em>many</em> times. And the reason why is simple: I have a three-year-old daughter. Need I say more?</p>
<p>Well, I will. Y’see, my family and I were fortunate enough to go on a cruise toward the end of last year, stopping off at Hamburg, Bruges, Rotterdam, and Le Havre. Our cabin’s TV included a range of on-demand movies, one of which was — you guessed it — <del>Terrifier 3</del> the Mario Movie.</p>
<p>So whenever we had a bit of downtime, which normally came toward the end of the day when we were getting ready to hit the hay, we’d stick the Mario Movie on for my daughter after much begging on her part. And I have to admit, watching her eyes light up whenever Princess Peach came on the screen, or when she giggled in delight when Bowser trapped Kamek’s fingers in a piano, my opinion of the film began to shift.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a15ab7e93eefe/mario-and-luigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I still don't think it's a great film or anything, but my daughter's enthusiasm became infectious. It is, after all, a movie primarily aimed toward kids, and so I started to view it through that exact lens. All of its faults — everything that I, as a self-proclaimed movie connoisseur, saw as blights upon a game series I'd adored since the mid-'90s — faded into the background.</p>
<p>Soon enough, we bought our daughter plushies of Mario, Luigi, and Peach, and we'd begin to act out scenes from the film together (with my wife begrudgingly playing the role of Bowser – heh!). This not only strengthened her love for the film, but also the bond that she and I had begun to foster.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the first couple of years of fatherhood were quite difficult for me; family and friends warn you that young children like to pick favourites and play parents off against one another, but I'm quite sure my daughter took this concept to its absolute limits, and it honestly pushed me to breaking point. So when she fell in love with the Mario Movie, it opened up a crucial opportunity for me to finally break down that barrier, and for nearly a year, we've enjoyed a wonderful relationship together that's only gotten better with time.</p>
<figure><a title="Mario Toys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2e548a373d4e2/mario-toys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Needless to say, when I showed her the first trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (which officially releases on 3rd April 2026, by the way), she was thrilled beyond words. And so was I, for that matter. I love the Galaxy games so much, and I genuinely can't think of a more appropriate direction for the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>What's even better is that, thanks to the aforementioned cruise ship also containing a small cinema, my daughter has proven that she's capable of sitting through a movie and staying reasonably engaged from beginning to end. So you can bet we'll be right there at our local Vue on day one for the sequel. This has the potential to be a memory that will last until my dying days, and that is far more precious to me than any criticism I might have against Nintendo and Illumination's work on the adaptations so far.</p>
<p>I'll never try to convince those who don't want children that they're making the wrong choice; parenting is <em>really</em> hard, man. But it's also full of magical moments that I wouldn't change for the world – or the galaxy, for that matter. The Super Mario Bros. Movie might not be anywhere close to being a masterpiece, but my goodness, am I glad it exists.</p>
<p>Bring on the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions’ recent Beyond the Strand livestream <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">gave us our first proper look at OD</a>, the developer’s horror game that’s being produced in collaboration with Xbox Game Studios. While the project’s first trailer features barely more than a couple of minutes of gameplay and is set entirely in a single room, it’s already creating quite a buzz. That’s because it’s distinctly reminiscent of P.T., Hideo Kojima’s famous 2014 “playable teaser” for a Silent Hill game that never was. P.T. went on to influence an entire wave of dread-fuelled horror games, but it seems like Kojima is finally returning to those ideas himself for OD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no suggestion that OD and P.T. are directly related, it’s already clear that this new Xbox exclusive horror is reusing and reinterpreting many of the themes, motifs, and designs that were established in the Silent Hills teaser. From ominous knocking to terrifying babies, let’s explore the significant connecting threads between these two projects.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Suburban Terror</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most clear link between OD and P.T. is their perspectives and settings. P.T. is played from the first-person perspective and takes place in what (at least initially) seems to be a mundane and unremarkable suburban home. OD appears to be following that approach, at least with the sequence we see in the trailer. The area in which the terror unfolds could be a room in anyone’s house – the dull walls, herringbone flooring, and miserable weather outside suggest another boring day in suburbia. But, like P.T., there are unnerving elements that pierce through the mundanity. For one, why is the room only furnished with two armchairs, both of which are oddly positioned? Secondly, and most importantly, why is there a shrine of burning candles?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cryptic Puzzles</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-0-36-screenshot-1758730286834.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T. earned widespread acclaim because it approached horror in a way largely unseen in video games prior. While its first-person perspective and complete lack of combat may well have been influenced by 2010’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a>, P.T. went several steps further and avoided any sense of traditional video game enemies. Instead, your foe was the environment itself: an endlessly looping corridor that holds you hostage until you can solve its many mysteries. With no tools provided aside from a simple flashlight, these puzzles were cracked through the use of simple observation. Find the right clues, and the house would morph on your next loop, slowly revealing the disturbing components that pieced together to tell the story of a murdered family. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no suggestion that OD will feature any kind of looping hallway, it does appear to take a similar approach when it comes to puzzles. The trailer opens with the protagonist, played by Sophia Lillis of It and Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, being told to “Light the fires to celebrate their [redacted]”. She then proceeds to light a number of candles using a box of matches, with each new flame causing changes in the environment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hush, Little Baby</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-1-39-screenshot-1758730302010.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most obvious and immediately scary element of this puzzle is its use of crying infants. As Lillis lights a baby-shaped candle, the shrieks of a crying newborn immediately fill the room, causing her to flinch and drop the match. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima, of course, has a famous connection to babies via <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, in which “Bridge Babies” are used to detect spirits. However, P.T. also prominently featured crying babies, as well as the more horrifying image of a mutated, bloody fetus lying in a bathroom washbasin. The trailer does nothing to explain how babies are related to OD’s story, but it’s clear that Kojima is once again turning to the chilling sound of a distressed infant to give you goosebumps.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who’s There?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/od-blogroll-1758604340335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the baby’s cries are certainly disturbing, the more ominous noise is the constant knocking that becomes increasingly louder and more frantic as the trailer progresses. This will clearly be a significant element – as revealed as part of the Beyond the Strand livestream, OD is subtitled “Knock”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really am afraid of big knock sounds," explained Kojima. And, once again, we can see that expressed in P.T.. Since the entire game takes place in a corridor, the environment is naturally filled with doors, and creepy knocking echoes through the hallway as you complete loop after loop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not the knocking itself that’s frightening, but what it signifies: someone (or something) that wants to get inside. It’s a warning that your safety is about to be breached. And considering that you have no weapons in P.T., that’s a terrifying prospect. The same seems to be true of OD – Sophia Lillis’ character has no ability to defend herself from whatever is trying to get through that door. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Don't Look Back </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/od-knock-teaser-trailer-esrb-4k-2-22-screenshot-1758730321595.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If it wasn’t already obvious from the oppressive atmosphere and screaming babies, it’s generally considered a bad idea to conduct a ritual about which you know nothing. Sophia’s candle lighting seems to summon something – we never see it, but after all that knocking, we hear that it opens the door and slowly, dramatically approaches. While neither we nor Sophia can see this foe, something else does: an image of an eye stuck to the window. As the man (or monster?) closes in, we see the image change – the eye opening wide in horror at what it observes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, there’s a link to P.T. here. During one of the loops, all the pictures mounted on the corridor’s walls are replaced with images of eyes that move and change as you walk through the house, as if they are observing you.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T. also preyed on the idea of a malevolent figure lurking behind you. The house is haunted by a spectral woman known as Lisa, who appears in a variety of frightening sequences. But beyond those scripted moments, there’s always the unsettling feeling that Lisa is close by – flickering shadows and eerie sound effects make it seem as if she’s just beyond your peripheral vision. And that’s because she quite literally is: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/09/pt-camera-hack-reveals-lisa-is-always-right-behind-you">her character model is tethered to you</a>, constantly following behind you as you explore the house. While we have essentially no information on how OD will play, the final moments of the trailer do suggest that the fear of someone being right behind you will be explored, just as it was in P.T..   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Hills are Silent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the unseen enemy approaches Lillis, you can hear the increasingly erratic sound of a Geiger counter. It seems to act as some kind of proximity sensor, akin to the motion detector used in Aliens. Or, perhaps more appropriately, the screeching static of Silent Hill’s radio. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">P.T., of course, was both a “playable teaser” and reveal for Silent Hills, a collaboration between Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro that would have been the next, potentially revolutionary chapter in Konami’s Silent Hill series. And while there’s absolutely no chance that OD is a secret Silent Hill game – Konami is not involved at all – there do appear to be a few nods to the series throughout this trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Geiger counter replicating the function of Silent Hill’s enemy-alerting radio static, there’s also the fact that the message that begins the trailer’s ordeal is delivered on a card through a gap in the door. This is reminiscent of Silent Hill 4: The Room, in which cryptic messages are slipped under the locked door of protagonist Henry Townshend’s apartment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The door through which OD’s mysterious message is delivered may also be hiding a small nod to Silent Hill – the design features nine red panels arranged in a three-by-three grid. This resembles the same three-by-three grid of red squares seen in Silent Hill 2, which featured on the game’s <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/silent/images/4/44/Silent_Hill_2_Japanese_Dust_Jacket.jpeg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200927215818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese box art</a> and can be found in-game as the story’s final save point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be surprising to see a number of other subtle references to Silent Hill in OD, but once again, this certainly isn’t Kojima finally making Silent Hills. And so while there are clear parallels between OD and P.T., the two are not canonically connected. It seems more likely that OD will relate to P.T. in the same way that Death Stranding – particularly its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">On The Beach</a> – relates to Metal Gear Solid. DS2 features a refreshed approach to combat that echoes the stealth sandbox of MGS 5, and one of its central characters, Neil Vana, is a clear nod to Kojima’s most enduring hero, Solid Snake. While Kojima no longer has any official ties to his former workplace at Konami, it’s clear that he still enjoys making connections with his past projects, and so it’s only logical that OD – his first horror project since Silent Hills – will echo P.T. in a number of ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not how OD replicates P.T. that’s the interesting thing – the more exciting prospect is how it will build on P.T.’s successes. And so now we look forward to learning much more about this project. After all, we know so little about it. We do know that Get Out and Nope director Jordan Peele is involved, but that he’s working on a separate OD experience, one that will replace the “Knock” subtitle with a different kind of fear. So is this an anthology of games, each one exploring unique phobias? Or will OD be a collection of different media, breaking boundaries between games and films? P.T. reimagined the shape of horror over a decade ago, of course, so we’re more than ready to see Kojima do it all over again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/is-od-connected-to-pt-hideo-kojimas-new-horror-game-explained]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>With those games excluded, SonixLegend's collection actually encompasses the vast majority of the 45,000 or so "full profile" paid games <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">tracked by SteamDB</a>. But with <a href="https://steamspy.com/year/">thousands of new games being released on Steam every year</a>, it might not be long until a badge for 50,000 owned games becomes a real possibility.</p>
<h2>So what’s good?</h2>
<p>It's hard to gauge just how much of SonixLegend's massive Steam collection officially counts as a "backlog" since their private account doesn't offer a public breakdown of playtime for most individual titles. That said, there are only 261 games for which SonixLegend has earned at least one achievement and only <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SonixLegend/recommended/">16 that were good enough to merit a user review</a> (they all ended up as "Recommended").</p>
<p>The implications of SonixLegend trying to actually work through their Steam backlog can be more than a little intimidating, though. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/steam?userName=SonixLegend">HowLongToBeat data</a> suggests that finishing just the "top 2,500" games in SonixLegend's Steam collection would take over 2,463 days, or nearly seven years of 24/7 gameplay.</p>
<p>Ironically, SonixLegend's favorite game isn't even one that counts toward their record-setting badge. The user's Steam profile page lists 551 hours spent playing Valve's 2010 free-to-play overhead shooter <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/630"><em>Alien Swarm</em></a>. In a way, it's nice to know that, even with access to nearly every paid modern PC game in existence, the one game this user keeps coming back to is a 15-year-old title that doesn't cost a penny.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-what-they-say-is-%E2%80%9Ceffectively-a-blueprint%E2%80%9D-for-subnautica.1307361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update in the Krafton versus Unknown Worlds founders saga that circles Subnautica 2 comes from two filings that Krafton has publicized. The core of these motions are allegations that Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, two of the three co-founders who are all currently in a legal battle with their former parent company, "<em>stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents</em>" prior to being fired.</p>



<p>Krafton then goes a step further to speculate that the theft was to further a plan to release Subnautica 2 on their own, without Krafton, and take the earnings from that to the bank, in so many words. Krafton also claims that what Cleveland specifically stole was "<em>hundreds of Sunaturica Maya (.ma) files, which are used in 3D animation modelling and contain proprietary embedded data, providing,</em> <em>effectively, a blueprint for a game</em>."</p>



<p>If you've not been following what's happened in what is an increasingly long timeline between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds, and the original creatives behind Subnautica and their former parent company, Krafton, then there's a bullet-point list at the bottom of this article to catch you up.</p>



<p>For now, we'll stick to what's new. One of the two filings is an affidavit from Kevin Negangard, a forensics technology expert who, per the affidavit, specializes in "<em>the preservation and investigation of electronic evidence from digital devices, the interrogation of complex data sets, and leading large-scale electronic discovery projects,</em>" and is where the key allegations of theft come from.</p>



<p>The other is a motion from Krafton to compel the court to allow for a forensic examination of Cleveland, McGuire, and Ted Gill's devices to further determine what was allegedly stolen, and asking the court to issue a protective order against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's side from obtaining all the documents it has asked for. Essentially, Krafton is asking to block the co-founders' requests for information from Krafton, while also asking to get more information from the co-founders to further its investigation and claims of theft.</p>



<p>While furthering its claims that the co-founders stole confidential files from Krafton and Unknown Worlds, Krafton also furthered its allegations regarding the co-founders having "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles, and puts that as at the center of why they were fired, alongside their alleged theft. "<em>The Key Employees were fired for Cause because they covertly abandoned their posts, deceived Krafton about it, and stole condifential information on their way out the door,</em>" the combined protective order and compel motion reads.</p>



<p>"<em>When Krafton discovered their ruse, Krafton asked them to do the jobs they promised they would and finish developing Subnautica 2. Krafton even offered to extend the earnout period if the Key Employees would come back to work. The Key Employees refused, threatened to self-publish Subnautica 2, and - anticipating their termination - stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents before they were fired, presumably in furtherance of their plan to unilaterally self-publish Subnautica 2 and capitalize on the earnout</em>."</p>



<p>Besides the filings, there's also a new statement from Krafton, which reads, "<em>Krafton's latest filings continue to highlight the former executives' misconduct. Despite offering to extend the former executives' earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former leaders refused to return to work, threatened to prematurely self-publish Subnautica 2, and stole hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents on their way out the door.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton will continue to present the evidence showing how the former executives violated their obligations and misused company resources, as the legal proceedings move forward. As Krafton has continued to make clear, at the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans, who deserve the best possible experience. Through this process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to Subnautica's fans</em>."</p>



<p>These filings follow a recent update from the legal battle, where two requests made by Krafton were denied by the court, and where Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemed to make a major U-turn on one of its key arguments</a> around why the co-founders were fired.</p>



<p>Ultimately, these allegations from Krafton, and from the co-founders around Krafton's own alleged shady tactics, are just that, allegations. We likely won't know the full truth of the matter even after it's all sorted out in the courts. </p>



<p>But it's clear that both sides are not backing down in their language and in their attempts to make their narrative the one that's widely known, even when some of the allegations, like how the co-founders allege Krafton's chief executive officer said the company would be "<em>embarrassed</em>" by having to pay Unknown Worlds its $250 million bonus, or Krafton's much-repeated claim that the co-founders flat-out refused to do their jobs, feel unbelievable at face value.</p>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're now only a week away from the first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4, where <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> will lead a table of 13 different players into the world of Araman, where mortals turned on the Gods and won. Ahead of the release, I had the chance to sit down with half of the cast to discuss character creation, what it has been like seeing the public's reaction to their characters, how Critical Role has evolved, and what fans can expect.</p>

<p>For this interview, I sat down with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matthew Mercer,</a> Marisha Ray, Laura Bailey, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fed64e82-f78a-4671-979b-0de0f235fb5e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/sam-riegel-talks-wildmount-wildlings-beau-and-yashas-adoption-plans-and-campers" rel="nofollow">Sam Riegel,</a> Robbie Daymond, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a77a65bf-2dda-4081-be3d-d54808255109" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aabria-iyengar-discusses-burrows-end-finale-dice-telling-story-and-what-happens" rel="nofollow">Aabria Iyengar,</a> and Alexander Ward. This cast includes co-founders who have been a core part of Critical Role since it was a home game and those who have been embraced by the Critical Role family, whether it be as DMs and players for additional stories in the world of Exandria, or those taking part in other Critical Role productions like <em>Narrative Telephone</em> or <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="87e91e8c-1acc-45e4-bc46-a5f9ce0adeac" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow">Candela Obscura.</a></em></p>

<p>To set my own understanding of just how much of Campaign 4's track has been laid down, the first question I asked was to know just how much of the Araman campaign had been played so far.</p>


<p>There was an immediate pause around the room, eyes darted around, no one wanting to say too much. Marisha Ray, who will play Murray the Dwarf, was the first to break the silence, "A nice skosh," not wanting to give much away. Riegel confidently added, "More than an episode, less than 10."</p>

<p>This likely puts their filming past the four-episode "Overture" that GM Brennan Lee Mulligan previously revealed would introduce us to the cast and set each character on their journey.</p>

<h2>Building A Character For West Marches</h2>

<p>For Campaign 4, a West Marches approach is being adopted, where the story will shift between a few active casts whose tales intersect around a core narrative. Knowing that each character was crafted to be part of a tighter group, but ultimately a smaller cog in the machine, I was interested to hear what the difference in approach was and if plans had been made among the cast to ensure certain players were seated at tables with each other.</p>

<p>Daymond threw up his first, joking and complaining that "they don't let us pick our own seats… isn't that mean? It's like the first day of third grade!"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crokas-critical-role-artwork.jpg?itok=DiLsnOp5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crokas-critical-role-artwork.jpg?itok=K0LEEGpY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alexander Ward, who gave an incredible performance as Crokas in EXU: Divergence, added, "You won't be able to tell, but I'm always seated in the corner."</p>

<p>"A bunch of us did get together and brainstormed character backstories that were together, or even goals that would intersect with other characters," Riegel said, offering up a serious answer on the character creation process. "But I don't think anyone requested or required to be sitting at a particular table in order to be with another cast member."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We developed our characters kinda like we always do, figuring out their backstories and their goals and their features and then threw them together in a big pot and stirred it up."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I penned this question, I thought about how each table might have felt like it's own smaller party to build around, but Riegel explained that it was quite the opposite. "The style of the campaign changed a little bit how we developed our characters just because there's so many of us we all needed to be more specific on what our short-term character goals were."</p>

<p>Not knowing how long they'll have the focus of the story before it wheels off to a different group also made the players feel like they needed to make sure their time counted.</p>

<p>"You kinda have to get your story out more quickly than in prior campaigns, and I think it made us all focus more specifically."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr-campaign-4-table-action.jpg?itok=HhR2pFzZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr-campaign-4-table-action.jpg?itok=hWV4tYau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To not let the mood get too serious, Ward detailed the process between Taliesin Jaffe and himself had to "do a lot of rock, paper, scissors to figure out who could be more spooky. It was a long day of us both doing paper over and over again."</p>

<p>Mercer piped up to add, "The big difference for me is that I got to do this process finally."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Various cheers rang out through the Zoom call as Matthew Mercer, DM of the previous Critical Role campaigns, reflected on getting to be a player for a full campaign.</p>

<h2>Who Plays The Soldier, Seeker, and Schemer in the Group</h2>

<p>When the party was introduced, the themes of the different smaller tables were Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers. I wanted to hear how those groups were built and understand just how focused they were on their goals.</p>

<p>Jokingly, Bailey called me out, "Secrets, secrets, secrets!" while Ray defended me that I "had to at least try asking." We all mused how difficult it is to interview about something that is to come, and not something that is readily available.</p>

<p>For those on social media who have been concocting ideas of who will be present at what table, Riegel did reassure that "We've seen collages that people have made speculating about who is at which table… and not a single one is correct." The entire cast burst into a united laugh.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robbie-daymond-critical-role-campaign-4.jpg?itok=paM72mk2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robbie-daymond-critical-role-campaign-4.jpg?itok=R2oA_C6G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Iyengar did offer some compassion that these attempts at guessing the tables "are entirely well reasoned, but completely incorrect."</p>

<p>To talk more about the theme of "Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers," Ray warned not to get too invested in the archetype. Just because a character is big and burly, swinging their sword around doesn't mean that they're going to end up at the soldiers' table. "Those are more encompassing of the current goals with the character and how they're aligned."</p>

<p>Knowing that Brennan Lee Mulligan has cited <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as inspiration, I asked just how set those tables were or if we could expect to see characters drifting from one group to another.</p>

<p>"We've talked about the possibility of tables cross-pollinating as the overall campaign progresses," Mercer explained. "We haven't explicitly planned for it because the story guides what happens, but that's definitely a possibility that we've all been ready for if it ever comes around."</p>

<p>Ray mused on the benefits of these smaller groups within the grander narrative. "It gives us the freedom to let the characters' individual goals guide their paths and not really be bogged down by one singular mission that another character may have that you don't necessarily share."</p>

<h2>Character Reveals and Reactions</h2>

<p>With a massive cast, I was excited to learn what they thought of fans' reactions to these mysterious characters that we'll be meeting on October 2. I made sure to bring up how much praise and excitement I've seen for Mercer to be playing a cunty character.</p>

<p>"I've been excited to see all of the reactions and so excited to see people's guesses about characters. Many incorrect, some very interesting. That's part of the fun of the pure speculation." Speaking to those assumptions, Mercer added, "A lot of people were expecting a dwarf and I thought 'eh, I've done dwarf twice, for the time being I've filled that personal scope.'"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mercer-and-ray-critical-role-campaign-4.jpg?itok=6of28sAT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mercer-and-ray-critical-role-campaign-4.jpg?itok=UoIEApwX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Ray, who is playing a dwarf, sounded off, "I've got you, babe."</p>

<p>"As long as one person plays a dwarf I'm happy, literally that came up in our character creation meeting." Mercer added a stern tone as he comically re-enacted, "As long as ONE of you plays a dwarf, that's my only requirement."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We nose goes'd and Marisha lost" - Iyengar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to the speculative nature of the fans, Iyengar explained, "I think there's something really fun, because we've only done a tasteful skosh we're still living in the 'what could be' as much as the fans are so there's a shared sense of 'I don't know either, I cannot wait to find out.'"</p>

<p>Bailey and Iyengar praised all of the shipping art that they've already seen for characters and how crazy it is to see when no one outside of the company has seen a single character interact with one another. Thankfully, "everybody's hot," Bailey reassured me.</p>

<h2>Who Is Aabria's Campaign Ex?</h2>

<p>My next question, I turned directly to Iyengar for as I asked, "Which character in this campaign was your character previously married to?"</p>

<p>Layering on a polite dose of sarcasm, Iyengar told me, "Oh my gosh, could you imagine doing that bit even more? That would be crazy."</p>

<p>Knowing that Ward is coming into a full campaign of Critical Role as a relative newcomer, I was interested to learn if there was any advice that other members of the cast had imparted upon him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Don't fuck this up" - Iyengar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ward shared that he was told to, "'Do your thing' and that 'we brought you in because we trust you,' and that was all the encouragement I needed."</p>

<h2>The Evolution Of Critical Role</h2>

<p>Critical Role Campaign 4 is one of evolution; New faces, a new set, and a new storytelling style. I posed to the cast members who have been around since the beginning what they're most excited about in Campaign 4 to show off to the longtime fans.</p>

<p>"To jump in here with a quick little anecdote," Mercer began, "When we started playing at home, we already had a lot of players at the table. Doing this for 10 years, it's been so wonderful being us just playing as our friend group, but we've all tried our best every chance we've had to bring more of our friends in."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt_0.jpg?itok=1o1-1-rU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cr_founders_credit_mikeschmidt_0.jpg?itok=Qq89GvNa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"I've fractured storylines specifically so we COULD bring more friends to the table to play for a little bit so that logistical challenge has always been a barrier, given that the core of everything we've done on this has been around our core friend group in this campaign, so this was the perfect opportunity to expand that in a meaningful way that we've been meaning to do for a long time."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was the right timing, and it's been very exciting to not just have guests but have our core cast expand with all of these wonderful people."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Riegel added, "and if this goes well. Campaign five: 25 people, Campaign six: 100 people, Campaign Seven: everyone in California."</p>

<p>To add a serious answer, Riegel also said he was looking forward to people getting to see Matthew Mercer play a character and "for everyone to realize he doesn't know how to do it… He's been DMing for so long, he actually doesn't know how to play, so we're teaching him a lot of rules along the way."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch-2000628219</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-september-state-of-play-new-rumors-and-where-to-watch.1307352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest PlayStation Showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-date-time-where-to-watch-2000627924">is later today</a>. Will it deliver or are Sony fans destined to wander the PS5 generation with big first-party announcements remaining few and far between? The Tokyo Game Show 2025-adjacent State of Play could deliver major updates on any number of highly anticipated games, including what’s next on Sony’s first-party docket for 2026. Is it finally time to see what Insomniac Games has been cooking with <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em>?</p> <p>The September State of Play livestream begins at 5:00 p.m. ET and will stream, per usual, on YouTube and Twitch. It has a “mercifully” concise runtime of just 35 minutes, with at least some of that devoted to Housemarque’s upcoming sci-fi shooter roguelike <em>Saros</em>. That suggests it could be on deck for the first half of next year, exactly five years after the launch of<em> Returnal</em>, a development cadence that a lot of PlayStation studios are hitting this generation.</p>  <p>But what about the rest of the 2026 release slate for the PS5? Leaks <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-showcase-state-play-tgs-2025-ff7-remake-part-3-2000626000">earlier this month</a> suggested that a new trailer for <em>Wolverine</em>, first seen back at a September 2021 Sony showcase, was ready for primetime and likely to air during the company’s next event. A build was leaked in the malicious hack back in 2023 and the game’s creative director left the studio last year. Outside of that, we still know hardly anything about how it will play or what <em>X-Men</em> stories it will weave into its campaign.</p>

 <p>On the third-party front, there’s a rumor that our next look at<em> Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> could be at the showcase to confirm a potential 2026 release window. We also know that Square Enix doesn’t have its own livestream booked for TGS, suggesting updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, <em>Dragon Quest 12</em>, or <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part III</em> could come during Sony’s showcase. It would be great to finally be able to put the rumors about the<em> Final Fantasy 9</em> remake to bed one way or the other as well.</p>

 <p>One game that seemingly won’t be at the showcase is Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/09/23/bungies-marathon-not-at-sonys-new-state-of-play-next-look-months-away/"><em>Forbes</em>‘ Paul Tassi reports</a> that an expected update on when the extraction shooter will launch won’t be part of the event. “The earliest we will see something more from <em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is November. And that’s a ‘maybe,’ right now,” he writes. The game has been going through some last-minute reworks after feedback from an alpha earlier this year and a scandal over plagiarized art soon after.</p> <p>Sony previously said it was still expecting the extraction loot shooter to hit before the end of March 2026. Given the wretched state of <em>Destiny 2</em> this summer, there couldn’t be more riding on it for the company’s live-service legacy and, more importantly, Bungie’s future.</p>

<p>"It made sense for us to do it, and we could," Miller said.</p><p>Black Ops 7's graphics and performance on PS4 and Xbox One won't be on par with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, Miller said. He added that the developer's mindset when mapping out new features is that "you should never be thinking about old-gen for the features that you're designing."</p><p>Also in the interview, Treyarch associate director Lawrence Metten said the team knew it wanted to bring back the Theater mode--which allows players to rewatch matches--even though it won't be supported on last-gen. "We can't support it on old-gen. That's not a reason not to do the feature. We're gonna bite the bullet and disable it on old-gen," he said.</p><p>In other Black Ops 7 news, the developer recently said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-dev-rejected-some-big-brand-collab-skin-deals-apparently/1100-6534981/" data-ref-id="1100-6534981">rejected a partnership with a "big brand" for collab skins </a>in the wake of criticisms that Call of Duty skins have become too wacky.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">play the game's multiplayer beta in October</a>.
