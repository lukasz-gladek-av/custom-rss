Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.</p><p>This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284809/squid-game-season-2-teaser-trailer">second season of <em>Squid Game</em></a><em>, </em>a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285689/disney-plus-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer-wild-ride"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a>. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called <em>Queer.</em> </p><p><h3>Squid Game season 2</h3></p><p><em>Squid Game</em> is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.</p><p><h3>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</h3></p><p>I’m very excited that Jude Law’s <em>Star Wars </em>debut, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, </em>is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Star Trek: Prodigy, </em>and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.</p><p><h3>Presence</h3></p><p>The moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film <em>Presence </em>doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/presence-trailer-steven-soderbergh-horror-1236195815/"><em>Variety’</em>s write-up of this trailer</a>. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.</p><p><h3>Queer</h3></p><p>Luca Guadagnino’s <em>Queer, </em>based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey). Having already gotten showings at the Venice Film Festival, some reviews have praised it for <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/queer-review-luca-guadagnino-daniel-craig-venice-film-festival-1236076219/">Daniel Craig’s performance</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/queer-review-daniel-craig-luca-guadagninos-1235986089/">Guadagnino’s “trippy” direction</a>. <em>Queer </em>releases <a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/05a98e4d-2610-420f-ab75-503e09238d6e">on November 27th</a>.</p><p><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X</h3></p><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">continued to <em>not</em> reveal</a> the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">successor to the Switch</a> in a batch of announcements this week that included the surprise launch of a new music streaming app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">only plays Nintendo songs</a>, the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a> as a paid app, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025">remaster of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, a 2015 Monolith Soft action RPG. The game will be available on March 20th, 2025, for the Nintendo Switch.</p></div><p><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286150/yo-ho-row-ho-with-mario-luigi">new trailer</a> this week, backed by a banger of a sea shanty that’s been stuck in my head all day today. The latest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> RPG series puts the brothers on a seafaring adventure that continues to make the Switch an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">excellent Nintendo console for <em>Mario </em>RPG games</a>. It’s available November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.
</p>
<p>It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

<p>If Typing Of The Dead was a riff on House Of The Dead - almost a mod of it, really - then Blood Typers is most obviously riffing on the original Resident Evil. You're moving around a spooky space, collecting bullets and other resources, managing your inventory, and finding keys to unlock new areas.
</p><p>Three-letter words appear on the ground that when typed cause your character to move to that spot. If there's an interactive element - an item to pick up, ladder to climb, jump to make - you can perform the action by typing a command with a preceding slash, like in text adventures of old. '/climb up' to scale a ladder, for example. You'll also need to use your left and right shift keys to rotate your character, to cast a flashlight into all the dark corners of each room.
</p>
<p>Might I prefer if this was a rail shooter, with movement not your concern? Maybe, but it's undeniably tense knowing that enemies can come from all sides. There are advantages to the more expansive framework, too: aside from different characters with their own skillsets, Blood Typers supporters co-op for up to four players, meaning you can all be clearing rooms together or exploring different parts of the procedural environments.
</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go for yourself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790330/Blood_Typers/">over on Steam</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-new-esports-world-record/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed by Esports Charts that the League of Legends World Championship, which wrapped in London, England tonight, has secured a new esports world record. During the final game of the last series in the tournament, a whopping 6.94 <strong>million </strong>users tuned in worldwide, smashing the records set by last year’s LoL Worlds.</p>



<p>If the power of League of Legends esports wasn’t already evident, this record has cemented it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-growth">Constant Growth</h2>



<p>League of Legends is, by numbers, the biggest esports title in the world. This monumental event that was capped off with a grand final in London was an eye-opener to the power of esports, even amidst the ‘esports winter’ that’s refusing to fully thaw.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>, it was confirmed that this final series peaked at 6.94 million viewers, which is a new world record that won’t be beaten any time soon. In the last few weeks, more than 190 million hours of game time were watched, and the average viewership throughout the month-long tournament exceeded 1.7 million.</p>



<p>There are no games out there that do it quite like League of Legends.</p>



<p>The tournament was streamed across various platforms, but it dominated on YouTube. More than half the peak viewer count was logged on the platform, with Twitch sitting in second place, which isn’t all that typical for esports. This is likely because at the start of the year, Twitch revealed it was ‘pulling out’ of South Korea.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship was a wonderful event from start to finish. It heralded the fifth trophy for T1 Esports – and the fifth for Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok, often considered the GOAT of the esports world.</p>

            <p>Good news, Disney fans - it looks like Disney Music Parade -Encore- is coming to Nintendo Switches outside of Asia.</p>
<p>Initially, Disney Music Parade -Encore- only had confirmed releases in Japan (21st November) and Asia (12th December), although English language support was in place for those prepared to import it.</p>
<p>However, as spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ghz20a/disney_music_parade_encore_rated_by_esrb/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, it has just popped up on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40237/disney-music-parade-encore/">ESRB</a> website, too… even though there are currently no confirmed plans for a US release.</p>

<p>ESRB's description says Disney Music Parade -Encore- is "a rhythm game in which players match on-screen prompts in time with music. Brief clips from Disney movies will occasionally play in the background".</p>
<p>"A handful of these clips include mild instances of violence (e.g., a character hit by a flaming arrow, a character kicking another person)", but none of this is egregious enough to deter an E for everyone rating.</p>
<p>The listing also confirms that there are no interactive elements, and seemingly no in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade - Encore - is a rhythm action game in which players tap to the beat of Disney songs as they ride through famous scenes from Disney animated films, including Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beauty, Moana, and Frozen.</p>
<p>The game also features Collections consisting of 150 different Music Rides depicting well-known Disney characters in a "brilliant, vibrant art style", as well as Memory Crystals that feature famous scenes from "beloved Disney animated films".</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade -Encore- is currently exclusive to Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There are currently no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">Rolling Stone</a>, which reported in an interview with creative director John Epler that "full attention [of BioWare] has shifted entirely to the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>" game.</p>

<p>Whilst Epler didn't comment directly on future content plans for the latest Dragon Age game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">IGN</a> says it believes BioWare plans to "support The Veilguard with quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".</p>
<p>If true, that's likely to surprise many BioWare fans familiar not just with Dragon Age, but its Mass Effect series, too. The studio has long been associated with quality DLC drops, including fan-favourite DLC expansions like Trespasser or Awakening.</p>
<p>Did you know that early on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg">Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare offers a knowing nod to Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series?</p>
<p>This week, Bertie sat down with Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider to hear about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">how BioWare knew some of the series' biggest plot points years ago, but kept its secrets hidden away</a>.</p>
<p>Awarding it a sterling five out of five stars in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> review, Bertie wrote: "It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it.

            <p>Earlier this week, Tom told us Nintendo Alarmo couldn't yet run Doom, but did confirm it could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-hack-cant-yet-run-doom-but-can-display-picture-of-a-cat">display a picture of a cat</a>.</p>
<p>Just three days later, however, Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has risen to the challenge and sent Alarmo rocketing into the Weird Things That Can Run Doom charts by... well, running Doom on Alarmo.</p>

<p>It's a long-running joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-you-can-run-doom-in-balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, a pregnancy test, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-is-now-playable-on-a-tractor">a tractor</a>, and a piece of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-piece-of-lego-can-now-play-doom">Lego</a>. It was only a matter of time for Alarmo to join the list, I guess.</p>
<p>"After my last post, it was pretty clear what everyone wanted to see on the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts quite rightly asserted.</p>
<p>"So, here it is - Doom running on the Nintendo Alarmo!"</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>As usually happens, there's a handful of caveats. Firstly, GaryOderNichts says there's currently no audio support, and to avoid the USB loader memory size restrictions, the .wad needs to be compressed and then uncompressed to external memory on boot.</p>
<p>"However, it's possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts explained.</p>
<p>And if you want to run Doom on your very own Alarmo, GaryOderNichts has <a href="https://t.co/3qBnVjIhqX">kindly shared his workings</a>. For more, including on what, exactly, is inside the Alarmo, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">check out the blog</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. It's currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available only to Nintendo Switch Online members</a> via the My Nintendo Store, priced £90/$99. It's expected to go on general sale from "mid-January 2025", helping fill the gap in Nintendo's launch schedule before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The dust has settled in London and your League of Legends World Championship 2024 winner has been crowned. In a close grand final fixture at the O2 Arena that saw the monumental series go down to game five, Bilibili and T1 clashed like the titans that they are, stunning millions of viewers worldwide – but only one team could win it all.</p>



<p>T1 walks away with a $445,000 grand prize and a FIFTH world championship trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>This League of Legends World Championship grand final will go down in the history books. The opening ceremony alone pulled in more than 4.2 million concurrent viewers, according to Esports Charts. That has effectively set an all-new record and beat the previous number reached in 2022 – 3.3 million. </p>



<p>The ceremony saw performances from Ashnikko, Mars Atlas of Forts, Tiffany Aris, and of course, Linkin Park. On social media, League of Legends fans were quick to call this the best opening ceremony in LoL Worlds history.</p>



<p>From start to finish, the final series blew the roof off the O2 Arena. As the final round unfolded, it proved to be a flip-flop of a game, with Bilibili securing the first match before T1 was able to fire back and net a win – but Bilibili netted another point and pulled ahead, sitting on match point as the fourth map approached.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Faker’s flank paid off massively here</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is where things got <strong>intense</strong>. As the match pushed on, Faker had a fire lit under him, going on more than one killing spree against BLG and making high IQ plays time and again. T1 had a massive lead on towers and in gold, and it proved to be too much for BLG, with T1 winning the game before a screaming crowd and a kill record of 14 – 9 over BLG.</p>



<p>And then it came down to the last game.</p>



<p>By the 24th minute of the map, things were relatively balanced. The scoreline sat at 3 – 2 kills and 2 – 3 towers, and both teams were almost equal on gold accrued. It was neck-and-neck with both teams busying themselves with finding openings across the Rift.</p>



<p>In the 29th minute, everything went insane in the middle of the Rift with Faker storming into the middle of a teamfight and netting a triple kill to complete an ace for T1, following which T1 went on to slam the Baron to net a huge chunk of gold.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The tide was turned</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ‘Unkillable Demon King’ that is Faker went on to pull off a second spree to take the scoreline from 6 – 12 in kills, and from there, it was all she wrote. The squad pushed into BLG’s base and scrapped everything, taking the win after an immense kill streak and securing the trophy for the <strong>fifth time</strong>.</p>

<p>In London, the League of Legends World Championship is unfolding in an epic fashion. It’s Bilibili Gaming versus T1 Esports, and there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. In the fourth game of the grand final, Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok made history by netting his <strong>five hundredth kill </strong>all-time in the tournament.</p>



<p>He’s been attending the League of Legends World Championship for a decade, and he’s the first person in history to hit this milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-records-on-records">Records on Records</h2>



<p>This is turning out to be a stunning tournament for T1’s Faker. This hyper-recognisable and incredibly talented esports pro player won his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/faker-100-matches-league-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100th LoL Worlds match</a> on October 12, and now he’s hit the milestone for 500 all-time kills in the tournament.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, T1 had pulled back from a 2 – 1 deficit to draw even with Bilibili Gaming, the team looking to score its first win ever on the grandest stage in esports. During the fourth round of the series, Faker eliminated BLG Xun to secure the 500-kill record, and shortly after, T1 won the map and prepared to move into game five.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The fateful moment, seconds after dropping BLG Xun</figcaption></figure>







<p>Time and again, Faker proves why he’s arguably the most impactful esports competitor in history. His record of four world championship wins speaks for itself, and the man is <strong>intent </strong>on winning another one today in London, England. He’s a rockstar competitor and nobody does it quite like him.</p>

I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954">reviewed it here at <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>, and despite being jaded toward the series for the better part of a decade, I really loved the long-awaited fourth entry. Right now it sits at a strong 84 on review aggregate site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span>, which is about in line with where these games typically land. The original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sits at an 86, with <em>Inquisition</em>, the series’ third entry, landing close by at 84. Meanwhile, <em>Dragon Age II</em>, probably the most divisive game in the series, sits at 79. As much as I loved my time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, I knew it would elicit some pretty divergent reactions from folks. There are 10s and there are some more middling scores. You can even find some folks straight-up saying they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF-Kd2BBpx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“do not recommend”</a></span> the game, like YouTuber Skill Up does while discussing all his problems with BioWare’s latest entry.

		<p>Critical Reflex has announced that the much anticipated multiplayer update for Buckshot Roulette is now available to all players. The development team has said that there are still some issues that were already identified in the multiplayer beta, and are currently working on ways to get those fixed. Creative Reflex is also going to be monitoring player submitted reports for other issues that could crop up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Buckshot Roulette — Multiplayer Update Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fle3zPwrz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, Critical Reflex said, <em>“Now, last time we spoke, we said, quote, “we don’t underestimate the capacity of you, High Rollers, to break games in half”. Turns out, we still sort of did. Here’s the thing: due to the peer-to-peer nature of the multiplayer, we have identified a few issues throughout the beta, so we’re already working on patches and fixes for those. Throughout the coming days we’ll be closely monitoring the community reports and react accordingly, so if you’ve got any thoughts to share — make sure to leave them at the Steam Forums or at our Discord server and we’ll certainly take them into consideration.”</em></p>
<p>Alongside multiplayer, the new Buckshot Roulette update has added brand new items to use, new music, new faces created by the fictional in game company Volta Standard Electronics. Buckshot Roulette is a dark horror card game in which players play Russian Roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. Players enter an arena within a nightclub to go three rounds with the dealer, and only one of you will survive.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">statement</a>, Twitch said that whilst it is a place "for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them", from now on, any stream that includes discussions about war, religion, or "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" needs to be labelled.</p>

<p>"Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them," Twitch explained.</p>
<p>"We require streams to be labelled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights."</p>
<p>Examples of content that require a classification label include streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies, live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes, and livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies.</p>
<p>Also subject to further labelling are discussions about military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters, and discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion.</p>
<p>"Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" is also subject to labels.</p>
<p>"Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate" are not subject to labelling, however.</p>
<p>"For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote," Twitch explained. "Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label."</p>
<p>The changes come after a trying few weeks for the livestreaming giant, which has found itself fielding accusations of islamophobia and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>"There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia," CEO Dan Clancy said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/">complementary statement</a>. "As our community has grown, we’ve endeavoured to build Community Guidelines to prohibit these harms."</p><p>"Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place."</p>
<p>"Millions of streamers, with a wide variety of views and perspectives, spend time on Twitch. We recognise that some content, while allowed on our service, may be objectionable to some members of our community. The views shared by streamers on Twitch are not the views of Twitch nor are they my personal views."We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community," Clancy concluded. "Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-apologises-for-issue-preventing-account-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine">Twitch issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict</a>. It said sign-ups were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users". However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix is live now on the popular free-to-play battle royale game. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking example</a> set with Fortnite Season OG, the island has been reset to the Chapter 2 map, albeit with several twists that will unroll throughout the season.</p>
<p>Starting right now, the Agency grounds are now known as The Doggpound, the new headquarters and home base for Snoop Dogg's enterprise. Players who venture there will have the opportunity to fight him and turn him into an ally, as well as obtain his Snoop's Drum Gun Mythic weapon.</p>
<p>In the second week of Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix, Eminem himself will take ownership of the Grotto cave and establish a restaurant called Mom's Spaghetti there. If you head to Mom's Spaghetti and defeat Eminem, you'll gain his support and receive the Mythic RG Minigun - a lyrical, rapid-fire weapon.</p>
<p>In the third week, hip-hop rapper Ice Spice is set to appear on Shark Island, which will temporarily be renamed Ice Island. Ice Spice is turning it into an ominous-looking shopping mall. If you defeat her, you're getting her support and the Ice Spice's Grappler weapon.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale event, which will go live on November 30 at 2 PM Eastern Time, will feature a homage to Juice Wrld. All players who log in between November 30 at 1 AM Eastern Time and December 1 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest news for Fortnite is arguably the imminent addition of a brand new cosmetic item called 'Kicks.' Epic Games explained:</p>
<p><em>The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite originals. Look out for other brands to join the lineup in the future! Kicks will be compatible with over 500 of the most popular Fortnite Outfits to start, with more than 95% of Outfits compatible by Spring of next year. While there are a few Outfits that are particularly challenging to style Kicks for, we’re working hard to make sure that as many Outfits as possible can throw on a fresh pair.</em></p>
<p>The first pair of Nike Air Jordan Kicks will be available from the Shop starting on Tuesday, November 12.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-underworlds-embergard-a-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes.1026006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Normally when you see board games move from edition to edition rules will be upgraded, but nothing truly monumental will shift. That's certainly not the case with the new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em>. While the core idea of a team skirmish game remains intact the board and way the Warbands are set up is entirely different.</p>

<h2>What's In The<em> Warhammer Underworlds Embergard </em>Box?</h2>

<p>Along with a new way to play the packaging has also been shaped up. Opening the box you'll be met with a large box that contains the games' 36-page instruction manual, a double-sided quick start guide, Miniature sheets and their assembly instructions, tokens, a game board, and four Rivals Decks.</p>

<p>The Rivals Decks are Emberstone Sentinels, Blazing Assault, Countdown to Cataclysm, and Pillage and Plunder.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=h_1-rFAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=dH2dWfCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the first of one of the major changes to the game. Warband-specific mechanics have been moved off the fighter's individual cards and onto a Warband card. The individual fighter cards instead allowing for beautiful full-color card artwork for each of the miniatures and using icons to represent their attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Realistically you still end up with the same, or more things to keep track of but I'm all for not needing to cram lots of tiny text onto cards. The Warband cards also contain some story context and how each Warband is inspired.</p>

<p>One disappointing aspect of how the game is packaged is that after putting together your Warbands there's no way to fit them in the box without it bulging out. A simple solution to this is to remove the bases off the larger minis (The Embergard) and just reassemble the next time you're wanting to pull it out to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=vyYSlnGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=GOy8OV-- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>With each player picking a Warband <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> is a skirmish game. Players take it in turns moving their characters according to their stats around the game board working to simultaneously complete Objectives, while also hindering their opponent from completing theirs, or just trying to kill them.</p>

<p>The game is played out over just three rounds with very limited turns meaning that every step, or misstep, has a chance to shift the momentum of the game. Each round is comprised of each player getting to take four turns, and then each of these turns is made up of an Action Step and a Power Step.</p>

This pattern will repeat until Player 2 has taken their fourth turn which will signal the end of the Battle Round with an End Phase.</p>

<p>The Action Step focuses on what's on the board in front of you, while the Power Step gives you a chance to activate cards from your hand or special abilities.</p>

<p>Gameplay, as well as the instructions, have been incredibly streamlined and it's now nowhere near as high a barrier of entry for a new player interested in getting started in the world of <em>Warhammer Underworlds.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>New Players Rejoice</h2>

<p>I've spoken in the past about how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a60a44-5c6a-4787-be2e-abd18b18f684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-starter-set-2023-review"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> can be complicated to get started</a>, but once you have it the pace speeds up. After praising the last Starter Set's ability to include an example game to teach you the mechanics this box does the same.</p>

There's even an included video link.</p>

<h2>Warbands And The RIvals Decks In Action</h2>

<p>The major benefit of having all of the thematic mechanics now on a Warband card is that no matter what deck you play a Warband with they will still retain their core mechanics. Yes, this does mean the complete removal of Warband decks.</p>

<p>The Emberwatch is a trio of powerful Fighters that are all about launching the offensive. Each has a massive amount of health and will do all they can to mow down your opponents Warband as quickly as possible. Becoming inspired based on being in enemy territory even their abilities are about placing themselves in the middle of the action and dealing additional damage at a moments notice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=02BgApzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=iId18sRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alternatively, Zikkit's Tunnelpack is a group of five Skaven fighters who inspire if one of their Warband takes damage or is killed. Leaning into this mechanic the greater numbers are combined with more fragile units. You'll want to sacrifice some to empower the rest here.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition to include both of these Warbands in the same box. The strength of one side channels into empowering the other. This makes this pairing a unique battle to see whether your own growth can outpace the growth that you're allowing your opponent to reach.</p>

<p>The four rival decks have their own unique gameplay mechanics that when combined with the different Warbands create for a wholly unique experience. These don't just change how you might approach combat in <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> but also how you'll navigate the board.</p>

<p>The Emberstone Sentinels Rivals Deck is all about completing objectives related to holding Treasure Tokens across the board, these are specific territories. The Blazing Assault Warband instead promotes a Warband's offensive capability.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> has always been a fun experience at my table, but whenever I've had to bring a new player in teaching the game has always been a daunting tasks. With the release of <em>Embergard</em>, even though it's not specifically a Starter Set aimed at those who have never played before, it does an incredible job setting up the players for success.</p>

<p>With new interactions between Warbands (and their constant abilities) and the different Rivals Decks changing the desired play style this also sets up this edition for success as new Warbands appear and Rival Decks are released each will be more compatible with one another.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24284956/windblown-roguelikes-friends-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of the most beloved roguelikes are single-player — the likes of <em>Hades</em>, <em>Balatro</em>, and <em>Dead Cells</em> are all solo titles. But <em>Windblown</em>, the new roguelike from Motion Twin, the studio that created <em>Dead Cells</em>, showed me just how cool it can be to play a roguelike with other people.</p><p>In <em>Windblown</em>, your character, one of a few adorable animal adventurers like an axolotl or a bat, is shot out of a cannon into a mysterious giant tornado to fight your way through various zones. Like <em>Dead Cells</em>, you can equip up to two main weapons. I typically have one for close-range bouts and another for long-distance attacks. But with every weapon, you’re also able to pull off a combo that uses a special move from the <em>other weapon</em> called an “Alterattack.”</p><p>Here’s an example. I love using a crossbow to attack enemies from a distance, and I pair it with a giant heavy blade. I rarely use the blade on its own; instead, I use its Alterattack that cracks open the earth in a straight line to continue to wallop on enemies at range. That turns a run into a steady rhythm of slinging arrows and using the Alterattack at <em>exactly</em> the right time, and with my five hours so far with the game, I haven’t gotten tired of the pattern.</p><p><em>Windblown</em> just launched in early access, and you can already unlock more than a dozen weapons, meaning there are a lot of combinations that I haven’t messed around with. And with four different biomes to get through on a run, there’s a lot to see, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The bosses are no joke.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Motion Twin</cite></p></div><p>All of that would be enough to make <em>Windblown</em> part of my regular rotation of roguelikes I use to wind down at the end of a long day. But the game’s multiplayer is making <em>Windblown</em> the game I turn to every time I turn on my Steam Deck.</p><p><em>Windblown’s</em> multiplayer lobbies, which you unlock fairly early on, let you play a full run with a team of three people. You can use voice and text chat to communicate, but it’s not required; I haven’t used those at all, instead relying on four in-game emoji. I also like that you can name your lobbies. I created one titled “help me get 1st win” and immediately had two helpful people join up to help me tackle the tornado. (Sadly, we did not get the win.)&nbsp;</p><p>When playing solo, I’ve found that I’m somewhat cautious and strategic as I think about how to use weapons and positioning to take on the game’s aggressive enemies and dodge their attacks. With the help of a team, battles are speedier and become delightful explosions of light, color, sound, and damage. It’s <em>so</em> fun to absolutely annihilate baddies with other people, and it’s comforting to know that they’ve got your back in a pinch.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of great roguelikes to play right now; <em>Hades II</em> just got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">a huge update</a>, <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">nearly impossible</a> to put down (especially now that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on mobile</a>), and I’ve wanted to get back into <em>Shogun Showdown</em>, which I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review">everyone is sleeping on</a>. <em>Windblown</em> needed more than just its Motion Twin pedigree to stand out, but so far, the multiplayer is the hook that keeps me coming back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has discussed the recent shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows until February 2025</a>, just a month before its originally intended release.
</p>
<p>
The move means Shadows will miss Assassin's Creed's typical pre-Christmas sales window, and comes amidst much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">scrutiny of publisher Ubisoft's ongoing fortunes</a>, as well as a culture war that has erupted over Shadows' main characters.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London last night, Coté reflected on the reasons for delay, and the crucial importance of the game to Ubisoft at such a pivotal moment for the company and the Assassin's Creed brand.

<p>
"Players can afford to be selective, choosing only the best, and they rightfully demand excellence," Coté said. "Ubisoft's portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality. 
</p>
<p>
"Players expect more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement from the games we release, and they're not shy about letting us know when they feel we have fallen short. This environment pushes us to do better and to be better. 
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> represents our opportunity to change that narrative, not just for Assassin's Creed, but I think for Ubisoft as a whole."
</p>
<blockquote>"In today's market, being amongst the best is just not enough anymore."</blockquote>
<p>
Shadows marks the beginning of a bold new push for the Assassin's Creed brand, and comes after a lengthy wait since the series' last fully-fledged blockbuster, 2020's Viking-fuelled Valhalla. (2023's Mirage was deliberately a smaller game, that began life as a Valhalla expansion.)
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is priming Shadows to be the launch of a new era of Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">underpinned by a central game launcher/hub</a>, a more accessible ongoing narrative, and technological advances made possible by finally ditching the last generation of consoles. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Ubisoft's other 2024 blockbuster - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - underperformed commercially, and the company once again finds itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">subject of speculation on its ongoing corporate independence</a>. The stakes have never seemed higher.
</p>
<p>
"We know this game has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise's storied history, set in one of the most anticipated settings we've yet to explore," Coté said. "But we also know that in today's market, being <em>amongst</em> the best is just not enough anymore." 
</p><p>Coté reflected on the infamous 2014 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">an ultimately too-ambitious technical leap for the series</a> set during the French Revolution. Ahead of launch, Ubisoft boasted that the game - the series' first installment for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - would be where the "next generation started". Ultimately, Unity's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround">graphical issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-patch-removes-need-to-play-companion-app">convoluted online systems</a> wrecked first impressions, and the brand took a huge hit.
</p>
<blockquote>"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed expectations."</blockquote>
<p>
"[Unity] was meant to be a major milestone for the series, but its reception at launch, marred by technical issues, left a deep impact on all parts of the company, from production to publishing, especially given Ubisoft's roots as a French company," Coté said. "This low point affected all of us, but it also served as a wake up call, reminding us how crucial it was to maintain the quality and integrity of the player experience from day one, a lesson that lives with us to this very day."
</p>
<p>All these years later, the spectre of Unity's launch still haunts the brand, it seems - and both Coté and Ubisoft bosses are keen to ensure it is never repeated.</p>
<p>
"After much reflection and analysis, I recommended to our top management to delay the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows," Coté continued. "Our playtests and team feedback made it clear Shadows had immense potential, but I felt we needed more time to ensure it fully meets the high expectations of our players. 
</p><p>
"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed those expectations. Shadows is our most ambitious and complex project yet, with interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology all releasing across the largest number of platforms with the most options we've ever, ever supported. 
</p>
<p>
"Taking this extra time allows us to polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise, one that I hope will carry us forward for years. This decision reflects our commitment to delivering an experience worthy of our players' time and attention on day one. We believe Shadows will shine as a true showcase of Ubisoft's talent and dedication, setting a new benchmark in quality for the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">Coté's lengthy and impassioned defence of Assassin's Creed Shadows' narrative choices and characters</a> - the reaction to which has involved a wave of backlash and online abuse aimed at the game's developers this year.

          <p>Some of my favorite games deny me the thing I think I want most.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty.1482655/">Elden Ring</a>&nbsp;</em>refuses to provide manageable save files (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-ground-me-into-dust-which-is-why-i-recommend-it/#gsc.tab=0">I paid for it</a>).&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/balatro-arrives-on-phones-sept-26-so-plan-your-sick-days-accordingly/#gsc.tab=0"><em>Balatro</em></a> withholds the final math on each hand played (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-the-long-dark">its developer suggests avoiding calculators</a>). And the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review-a-world-worth-saving/">modern X-COM games</a> force me to realize just how much a 98 percent chance to hit is not the same as 100 percent.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/"><em>Dystopika</em></a> (Steam, Windows) is a city builder in maybe the strictest definition of that two-word descriptor, because it steadfastly refuses to distract you with non-building details. The game is described by its single developer, Matt Marshall, as having "No goals, no management, just creativity and dark cozy vibes."<em> Dystopika</em> does very little to explain how you should play it, because there's no optimal path for doing so. Your only job is to enjoy yourself, poking and prodding at a dark cyberpunk cityscape, making things that look interesting, pretty, grim, or however you like. It might seem restrictive, but it feels very freeing.</p>

<p>The game's interface is a small rail on the left side of the screen. Select "Building" and a random shape attaches to your cursor. You can right-click to change it, but you can't pick one. Place it, and then optionally place the cursor near its top to change its height. Making one building taller will raise smaller buildings nearby. Reaching certain heights, or densities, or something (it's not explained) will "unlock" certain new buildings, landmarks, and decorations.</p>

<p>You do get to pick out "Props," like roads and trams and giant billboards and hologram objects and flying carports, but the game is similarly non-committal on what you should do with them, or most anything. You put things down, or delete them, expand them, connect them, and try things out until you like how it looks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is seemingly doing well for itself so far. It had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> Steam concurrency records for a BioWare and EA single-player premium game yesterday, and the numbers have improved since, with a new peak of 77.4K registered twelve hours ago.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, there are no plans to make any story DLCs for it. That's what Rolling Stone&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a></span> as part of an interview with Dragon Age: The Veilguard Creative Director John Epler. The reason is fairly straightforward: BioWare isn't a large team nowadays, and they are currently focused on making the next Mass Effect game, which Executive Producer Mike Gamble recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> will stick to the photorealistic art style and mature tone.</p>
<p>Of course, this interview was conducted when the game had only just released. If Dragon Age: The Veilguard turns out to surpass EA's sales estimates (CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors it has breakout potential), there's a chance those plans might change. Still, from a narrative standpoint, Veilguard does close up nicely (unlike Inquisition, which very much needed the DLCs to really bring the story to a proper conclusion).</p>
<p>In the Rolling Stone interview, John Epler went into the feedback that BioWare absorbed from its fans to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a better game. From Mass Effect Andromeda, the studio learned that the polish wasn't enough and that the open world design was lacking:</p>
<p><em>I do think Andromeda was a better game than its reception suggested, but on the flip side, I don’t think the reception was unfair. At the time of launch, there were technical issues and things that didn’t work.</em></p>
<p><em>We had been doing Dragon Age pre-production on versions of Dragon Age 4, and we did have a version that was a lot more open-world. But again, we ran into the same problem of how do you make it compelling or narratively interesting? The reception to Andromeda definitely solidified that.</em></p>
<p>From Anthem, of course, they understood that the multiplayer focus was not working:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio built to make single-player RPGs. And more importantly, I think a lot of people have come here to build single-player, story based RPGs. So, it just kind of ended up making more sense to make this game the way it is versus a multiplayer game.</em></p>
<p><em>We were alienating parts of our fan base that had been with us for a long time, and not successfully bringing in anyone else through the multiplayer side of things. The reception to Anthem was very clear in that we needed to get back to those aspects that we did well, and multiplayer became an obstacle in the way of doing just that.</em></p>
<p>With that said, Epler did not entirely close the door to doing another multiplayer game in the future:</p>
<p><em>It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game. Final Fantasy XIV does an excellent job. Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world and the world changes.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, Epler said Inquisition players felt there wasn't enough companion banter, which was also fixed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>

<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the iPhone became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/iphone-users-spend-147-hours-a-month-playing-games/">a massive gaming platform in its own right</a>, when Apple released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/wicked-cool-apple-gaming-wednesday/">wide</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/5439/">range</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/12/peggle-and-bomberman-keep-the-good-ipod-gaming-times-flowin/">games</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/games-games-games-one-for-your-ipod-and-one-for-your-iphone/">designed</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/11/new-ipod-game-phase-rhythm-games-on-a-clickwheel-yippee/">late-model</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/09/tetris-ms-pac-man-sudoku-for-new-ipods-released/">clickwheel</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/game-review-song-summoner-the-unsing-heroes-ipod/">iPods</a>. While those clickwheel-controlled&nbsp;titles <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/looking-back-at-the-history-of-ipod-click-wheel-games/">didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire</a>, they represent an important historical stepping stone in Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/the-mac-gaming-console-time-has-forgot/">long journey</a> through the game industry.</p>
<p>Today, though, these clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged in <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">a quest to preserve these games</a> in a way that will let enthusiasts enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come.</p>
<h2>Perhaps too well-protected</h2>
<p>The short heyday of iPod clickwheel gaming ran from late 2006 to early 2009, when Apple partnered with major studios like Sega, Square Enix, and Electronic Arts to release 54 distinct titles for $7.49 each. By 2011, though, the rise of iOS gaming made these clickwheel iPod titles such an afterthought that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/">completely removed them from the iTunes store</a>, years before the classic iPod line was discontinued for good in 2014.</p>

<p>In the years since that delisting, the compressed IPG files representing these clickwheel games have all been backed up and collected in <a href="https://archive.org/details/ipod-click-wheel-games-archive">various archives</a>. For the most part, though, those IPG files are practically useless to classic iPod owners because of <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">the same strict Fairplay DRM</a> that protected iTunes music and video downloads. That DRM ties each individual IPG file not just to a particular iTunes account (set when the game file was purchased) but also to the specific hardware identifier of the desktop iTunes installation used to sync it.</p>
<p>Games already synced to iPods and iTunes libraries years ago will still work just fine. But trying to sync any of these aging games to a new iPod (and/or a new iTunes installation) requires pairing the original IPG file provided by Apple years ago with the authorized iTunes account that made the original purchase.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Didn't back up that decades-old file? Sorry, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>A set of 20 clickwheel iPod games was eventually patched to work on certain iPod Video devices that are themselves flashed with custom firmware. But the majority of these games remain completely unplayable for the vast majority of classic iPod owners to this day.</p>
<h2>A virtual workaround</h2>
<p>Luckily for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/">the sizable community</a> of <a href="https://discord.gg/nZ2dD64X">classic iPod enthusiasts</a>, there is a bit of a workaround for this legacy DRM issue. Clickwheel iPod owners with working copies of any of these games (either in their iTunes library or on an iPod itself) are still able to re-authorize their account through Apple's servers to sync with a secondary installation of iTunes.</p>

<p>If multiple iPod owners each reauthorize their accounts to the same iTunes installation, that copy of iTunes effectively becomes a "master library" containing authorized copies of the games from all of those accounts (there's a five-account limit per iTunes installation, but it can be bypassed by copying the files manually). That iTunes installation then becomes a distribution center that can share those authorized games to any number of iPods indefinitely, without the need for any online check-ins with Apple.</p>
<p>In recent years, a Reddit user going by the handle Quix used this workaround to amass a local library of 19 clickwheel iPod games and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/vzaj7w/comment/igc8nkz/">publicly offered</a> to share "copies of these games onto as many iPods as I can." But Quix's effort ran into a significant bottleneck of physical access—syncing his game library to a new iPod meant going through the costly and time-consuming process of shipping the device so it could be plugged into Quix's actual computer and then sending it back to its original owner.</p>
<p>Enter Reddit user Olsro, who <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">earlier this month</a> started the appropriately named <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>. Rather than creating his master library of authorized iTunes games on a local computer in his native France, Olsro sought to "build a communitarian virtual machine that anyone can use to sync auth[orized] clickwheel games into their iPod." While the process doesn't require shipping, it does necessitate jumping through a few hoops to get the Qemu Virtual Machine running on your local computer.</p>

<p>Over the last three weeks, Olsro has worked with other iPod enthusiasts to get authorized copies of 45 different clickwheel iPod games synced to his library and ready for sharing. That Virtual Machine "should work fully offline to sync the clickwheel games forever to any amount of different iPods," Olsro wrote, effectively preserving them indefinitely.</p>
<h2>For posterity</h2>
<p>Olsro told Ars in a Discord discussion that he was inspired to start the project due to fond memories of playing games like <em>Asphalt 4</em> and <em>Reversi</em> on his iPod Nano 3G as a child. When he dove back into the world of classic iPods through a recent purchase of a classic iPod 7G, he said he was annoyed that there was no way for him to restore those long-lost game files to his new devices.</p>
<p>"I also noticed that I was not alone to be frustrated about that one clickwheel game that was a part of a childhood," Olsro told Ars. "I noticed that when people had additional games, it was often only one or two more games because those were very expensive."</p>
<p>Beyond the nostalgia value, even Olsro admits that "only a few of [the clickwheel iPod games] are really very interesting compared to multiplatform equivalents." The iPod's round clickwheel interface—with only a single "action" button in the center—is less than ideal for most action-oriented games, and the long-term value of "games" like <em>SAT PREP 2008</em> is "very debatable," Olsro said.</p>

      A short review of <em>Phase</em> shows off the basic rhythm-matching gameplay.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>Still, the classic iPod library features a few diamonds in the rough. Olsro called out the iPod version of <em>Peggle</em> for matching the PC version's features and taking "really good advantage from the clickwheel controls" for its directional aiming. Then there's <em>Phase</em>, a rhythm game that creates dynamic tracks from your own iPod music library and was never ported to other platforms. Olsro described it as "very addictive, simple, but fun and challenging."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Even the bad clickwheel iPod games—like Sega's nearly impossible-to-control <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> port—might find their own quirky audience among gaming subcommunities, Olsro argued. "One [person] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HdWWhZ0hDM">beat <em>Dark Souls</em> using DK bongos</a>, so I would not be surprised if the speedrun community could try speedrunning some of those odd games."</p>
<p>More than entertainment, though, Olsro said there's a lot of historical interest to be mined from this odd pre-iPhone period in Apple's gaming history. "The clickwheel games were a reflect[ion] of that gaming period of premium games," Olsro said. "Without ads, bullshit, and micro-transactions and playable fully offline from start to end... Then the market evolved [on iOS] with cheaper premium games like <em>Angry Birds</em> before being invaded with ads everywhere and aggressive monetizations..."</p>

            </figure>

<p>While Olsro said he's happy with the 42 games he's preserved (and especially happy to play <em>Asphalt 4</em> again), he won't be fully satisfied until his iTunes Virtual Machine has all 54 clickwheel titles backed up for posterity. He compared the effort to complete sets of classic game console ROMs "that you can archive somewhere to be sure to be able to play any game you want in the future (or research on it)... Getting the full set is also addictive in terms of collection, like any other kind of collectible things."</p>
<p>But Olsro's preservation effort might have a built-in time limit. If Apple ever turns off the iTunes re-authorization servers for clickwheel iPods, he will no longer be able to add new games to his master clickwheel iPod library. "Apple is now notoriously known to not care about announcing closing servers for old things," Olsro said. "If that version of iTunes dies tomorrow, this preservation project will be stopped. No new games will be ever added."</p>
<p>"We do not know how much time we still have to accomplish this, so there is no time to lose," Olsro <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">wrote on Reddit</a>. iPod gamers who want to help can contact him through his Discord account, inurayama.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> servers are down, but don't worry. It's all part of the plan. Fortnite servers will be back up soon; here's what you need to know.</p><p>With Fortnite's latest all-Marvel season coming to an end, it's time to look ahead to what's next, and it's poised to be another nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans. Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 is imminent. Like Fortnite OG last November, this is poised to be a return (and remix, of course) of the original Chapter 2 island, complete with skins, weapons, loot, and more all fitting of that era of Epic's massive game.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in this year's massive Remix season, though Epic has already revealed it will unfold for just one month before another Chapter finale event ushers in another new island in December.</p><p>The Chapter 2 map coming back will be, for some players, a bigger deal than the OG map last year, but all we can do now is wait until Epic brings Fortnite back online. But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, November 2--though there have been major exceptions.</p><p>Earlier this year, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day. But that was a very unusual situation and shouldn't be expected to be repeated often.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751"></a><figcaption>A new blast from the past is coming very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg"></figure><p>Once the game does return, Remix Chapter 2 will introduce a whole host of changes such as a new (well, <em>returning</em>) map inspired by Chapter 2, vehicles fitting of that era--or perhaps no vehicles at all at first, since cars weren't added until Chapter 2 Season 3--as well as a new Remix Chapter 2 Pass that is likely to celebrate some of that era's favorite characters with mash-ups, such as Meowscles and Midas being combined into one character.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 right here.</p>
