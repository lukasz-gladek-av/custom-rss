                <p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming to PS5, ending its console exclusivity on Xbox. An release date has not been announced, but it will be out in late 2025, and you can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014084" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist</a> it now.</p><p dir="ltr">In a rather meta announcement trailer, rendered in-engine, soldiers are shown huddled around the colonel, who has his feet up while playing what appears to be Stalker 2 on the TV with a controller. It's eventually revealed that the controller resembles that of a PlayStation controller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw">IGN</a>, the description adds that the PS5 version "will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion." It will also include "technical enhancements" for the PS5 Pro, although there are no further details.</p><p dir="ltr">While we await more information and its release date, you can watch our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">Stalker 2 documentary</a> about how developers were affected first-hand by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 launched last November as an Xbox console exclusive, although leaked documents alleged that it was only going to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-only-has-three-month-exclusivity-on-stalker-2/1100-6490905/">timed exclusive for three months</a>. The longer wait could be related to the buggy state that the game launched in, with issues plaguing the post-apocalyptic shooter following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/">day-one patch</a>, while its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-major-patch-has-more-than-1800-bug-fixes/1100-6528561/">first major patch</a> fixed more than 1,800 bugs.</p><p>This follows other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/">first-party Xbox exclusives making the leap to other platforms</a>, when early last year Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirmed four first-party Xbox titles would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. This has continued in 2025 with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> following its original launch last December, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will release day-and-date on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC in August.</p>

The PC-only shooter released in early April but never seemed to find an audience, having only reached a concurrent player peak of 4,479 shortly after launch, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1691340/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In recent weeks the game's player count has hovered around the 250 mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLIAwGOBZ0w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CLIAwGOBZ0w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable," Wargaming's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> on the sunsetting of Steel Hunters reads. "We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment."</p><p dir="ltr">However, players have the next 90 days to still play the game, during which Wargaming will unlock all of the game's unique Hunters (including new Hunters that were presumably still in development), as well as introduce the ability to host custom games. A final "farewell" tournament is also being planned, with Wargaming stating it will share more details in the game's official Discord server soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters sees players pilot massive mechs called Hunters. Some mechs are humanoid in appearance, while others are massive mechanical animals reminiscent of the mechs from the anime series Zoids. Each mech can be customized and modified with various weapons, mods, and abilities. The game was an extraction shooter, one where players would drop in, acquire loot from battling NPC enemies, and attempt to escape, all the while avoiding or battling other player-controlled Hunter squads.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very first days of the Alpha you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey," Wargaming's shutdown notice reads. "We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly."</p><p dir="ltr">Wargaming may be shutting down Steel Hunters, but it still operates several live-service titles. One of those games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a>, which recently announced it is introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-two-90s-gaming-icons-are-coming-to-world-of-tanks/1100-6533014/" data-ref-id="1100-6533014">tank versions of two '90s gaming icons</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Steel Hunters isn't the first live-service game to be gone too soon, and it likely won't be the last. Nexon's free-to-play multiplayer melee title<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yet-another-live-service-game-is-shutting-down-just-months-after-launch/1100-6520621/" data-ref-id="1100-6520621"> Warhaven shut down after just seven months</a> and ahead of a planned console launch last year, and Sony's shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord infamously barely lasted a week</a> before it was announced servers would go offline.

Naughty Dog editorial content manager Jonathon Dornbush wrote in the post that the studio "always wondered" what it would be like for players to experience the story in chronological order. He prefaced this by saying that the original structure—where players first play through the story as protagonist Ellie, then as new character Abby—is still "very intentional and core to how our studio wanted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s themes and narrative beats to impact players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios are prone to release post-launch updates and DLCs that expand on existing stories. A mode that deliberately reframes a non-linear narrative isn't as common. The closest comparable example would be how companies like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Steel">Bethesda Softworks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/dlc/single-player/trespasser">BioWare</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have released downloadable content meant to expand the endings of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but these updates don't alter the pacing of the original game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developer believes that players will gain "even deeper insight" into the sequel's narrative, experiencing parallels between the protagonists Ellie and Abby, as well as how close they come into running into each other across their personal ventures through Seattle. Naughty Dog "of course" recommends players new to the game to play through the story "as was originally developed." The bulk of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> takes place across three days, which the player experiences through the perspective of both characters separately. There's also a myriad of flashbacks fleshing out their respective character arcs, the placement of certain scenes being quite deliberate and important in providing context.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-sees-the-classic-series-renewed-with-capcom-s-latest-technology" target="_self" data-discover="true">Onimusha: Way of the Sword sees the classic series renewed with Capcom's latest technology</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Naughty Dog teamed up with Nixxes to bring the Chronological mode to life.

The HBO adaptation's choice to lean on the game's non-linear structure to split its narrative across several seasons has drawn mixed reception. The season, which ran from April 13 to May 25, encompassed Ellie's perspective through the events in Seattle, while also hinting that season 3 will follow Abby's instead, which is how the game is originally structured.

<p>In speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fan-meets-pope-leo-gets-him-to-sign-a-popplio-pokemon-trading-card-and-it-looks-like-the-pontiff-got-the-joke?utm_source=campaigner&amp;utm_campaign=NL_FIX_July_08_2025&amp;cmp=1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;Ictg=45858995214">IGN</a>, ReptileCake said that Pope Leo took the whole thing in his stride and clearly understood the reference, happily signing the card in question:</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkzywlv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It was pretty chill. We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p>
<p>"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the card immediately gaining a significant amount of worth, ReptileCake says that he has no intention of selling it on, stating that Pope Leo agreeing to sign the card is "worth more than any monetary value can satisfy", and that it is now "a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity".</p>

<p>So there you have it! Quite a wholesome little incident, all told. Though we imagine this will kickstart a rather concerning trend in which fans flock to the Vatican to get their own Pokémon cards signed.</p>
<p>It's a whole new ball game for scalpers, huh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella has published the sales charts for US video game sales in May 2025, showing a similarity to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's global report</a> in that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> was one of the month's best-selling games, and in the US specifically, it was the best-selling game. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign topped the US sales charts for premium games across all platforms, followed by DOOM: The Dark Ages in second place and Forza Horizon 5 in third, driven by Forza Horizon 5's launch on PS5. Bethesda's Oblivion Remastered was pushed into fourth place after being the top-selling game in the US for April 2025,  while Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 stayed at fifth place. </p>



<p>The other notable entry in the top 20 best-selling premium games for May 2025 in the US, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars: Battlefront 2</a>, which jumped all the way from 135th on the monthly charts, to the number 12 spot, just behind Assassin's Creed Shadows in 11 and just in front of Split Fiction at number 13.</p>







<p>Elden Ring: Nightreign's surge to the top spot for May 2025 also made it one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far, though it wasn't enough for it to crack the top 10, since it only made the list at number 11. DOOM: The Dark Ages was even further behind at number 16. The most significant change in the top-selling games in the US in 2025 so far was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered jumping ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows to take second place, while Shadows now sits in third. Monster Hunter Wilds is still the best-selling game of 2025 so far in the US.</p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the PlayStation 5 was still the best-selling hardware of the month, though spending on video game hardware was down 13% compared to May 2024. It'll be interesting to see how different those numbers are when the report for June 2025 is live, and we see how much of an impact the Nintendo Switch 2 launch had on hardware spending in the US.</p>



<p>Overall, it was a month of growth for the video game industry in the US compared to May 2024, with spending on video games up 1% compared to last year. Which is a good sign for the industry, though we'll see if that growth is able to last into next year, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella recently warned that tariffs and rising costs of essential items</a> are leading a significant portion of US consumers to spend less on video games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/video-games-industry-is-facing-a-fundamental-realignment-june-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-video-games-industry-is-facing-a-%E2%80%9Cfundamental-realignment%E2%80%9D-having-moved-from-a-%E2%80%9Ccontent%E2%80%9D-past-to-a-%E2%80%9Csocial-network-of-games%E2%80%9D-present-says-former.1239384/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The video games industry is facing a "fundamental realignment", having effectively moved on from the "content" past to a "network" present that has deeply changed the forces that kept the whole industry together, according to Square Enix former Director of Business.</p>



<p>In a lengthy thread posted on <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">X</a>, Jacob Navok, who, as Director of Business, worked closely with Square Enix's CEO in the past, offered a very interesting in-depth analysis of the current state of the video games industry, highlighting the now mature shift from a content phase to a network phase and how this could evolve further in the future. For years, the vast majority of bigger publishers like Square Enix focused on producing content, which was the focus of the business. In 2004, however, something started to change, as former Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada began writing about the network in his annual letters to shareholders, highlighting how that was the future, rather than content. Many believed he was referring to MMOs, but as time passed, it became clear he was referring to what is dominating the video games industry: the "social networks" of games, or rather platforms via which players access games.</p>



<p>For a very long time, the industry was defined by scarcity of content. Players would complete a game and move onto the next, and this held true even as the industry started moving towards richer mediums and MMOs. Creating good content and marketing the content appropriately would lead to profitable income. This is why release dates were set in the Fall towards the Holiday season, generally avoiding launching on the same date as other big hitters. A portion of the industry still works this way, but it is crumbling. Speaking about the Final Fantasy series, the former Square Enix employee highlights that the problem isn't increasing costs, but the inability to generate the revenue needed. The audiences expected to play the game did not come, and were not willing to pay to spend their time.</p>



<p>What players, especially the younger generation, are willing to spend their time on nowadays are platform titles like Roblox and Fortnite, and a few other dominant forever games which are acting closer to platforms. Add in a social network like TikTok, which scratches the same itches of casual games, and it's evident how players have less and less time to spend on traditional games, which continue to function as content and no longer enjoy the success of the past. Even in the network era of the video games industry, however, not every forever game that also acts as a platform can succeed, as few games can achieve the same level of success of Fortnite, a situation that mirrors social networks well, as only TikTok, has grown to a prominence that can rival Facebook and Instagram.</p>



<p>This doesn't mean that video games are going away, Jacob Navok continues, but it's a clear indication of how the video games industry has to change in its fight for time against social networks and platform, forever games. This is the problem Microsoft is facing today, and a situation that has changed a lot since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and greenlighting the games that were canceled last week, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a> reboot. Concord is a clear example of an industry that has radically changed in the past few years, as a $400m investement and eight years of work with zero revenue generated would have never happened in the past, alongside some of the June 2025 happenings, which the former Square Enix Director of Business thinks to have been a critical month for the industry. Nearly $1bn has been invested by the video games industry in games like MindsEye, Splitgate 2, Marathon and FBC: Firebreak, and none of the launches and betas have gone as planned. Promises have been made to fix the games, but it's unlikely the market can sustain all of them. One may argue that cutting costs could improve the situation, but that doesn't address the real issue: the lack of players.</p>



<p>With the traditional video games industry facing these challenges, Microsoft's recent actions are better explained. AI is a one-in-a-generation change in the entire digital order, and a dollar spent on AI may net back one hundred times as much, while a dollar invested in Xbox would either get burned or earn too little. With the market being what it is today, the decision to cancel games like the Perfect Dark reboot makes total sense, as it was very unlikely these would have take players away from dominating games.</p>



<p>This is something that Sony is also facing, to an extent. as Roblox, UEFN will continue to stay and represent the future of the video games industry. Jacob Navok makes the example of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which barely sold more than Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did in just three days. As things stand, a dollar spent on a game like this is better spent on trying to make a Fortnite, which is what Sony will keep trying to. The Japanese company needs a forever platform, or it will still be a company in the content business during the network business era. Nintendo may manage to continue being a content business company, but Sony may not.</p>



<p>AI is also going to play a prominent role in this new era of the video games industry, empowering Roblox-like experiences that will give players the ability to create interactive worlds in five to ten years. In this sense, Take-Two, which has shown no concerns for the cost required to make Grand Theft Auto VI, seeing it as a function to achieve a dominant position in the current landscape, Epic and Roblox will compete with OpenAI, xAI and so on, as big tech companies are already making interactive world models that will compete with games. "<em>Games, AI, and tech are really part of the same network effect. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. In other words, the platforms with the most creators and players generate the most value,"</em> the former Square Enix Director of Business concluded, highlighting how Wada-san's observation on networks transforming the video games industry was ultimately about the network of players.</p>



<p>Although this isn't the first time we have heard from people who work, or worked in the video games industry how one of the current challenges is to convince players to spend time on new games, the analysis by Square Enix's former Director of Business has painted a more complex picture that highlights well how traditional games will have a harder time finding success in the future. The industry, however, is unpredictable, so it will be very interesting to see if these predictions will end up being correct in the coming years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for May 2025, and FromSoftware and Bandai Namco will have cause to celebrate this month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuov7li22j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game across all formats in May, and it topped the individual PlayStation and Xbox charts as well. As a reminder, I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" rel="nofollow">awarded the game an 8 out of 10 score</a>, so I'm pretty pleased it managed to sell as well as it did.</p>

<p>Of course, given that sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">topped 3.5 million</a> just a few days after the game was released, it's not surprising that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>performed as well as it did. Still, since the game is an experiment on FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's behalf, it will no doubt come as a pleasant surprise for both studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-circana-may-2025-chests.jpg?itok=9TmyQHFq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-circana-may-2025-chests.jpg?itok=x_eQNXOs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>topped sales charts for May 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>May's second best-selling game across all formats was&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which, considering that the game was released on Game Pass on day one, is pretty impressive. As a reminder, Bethesda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bethesda.net/post/3lpmvjo7noz2c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> shortly after launch that&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>had hit three million players, although since that number includes Game Pass players, it's perhaps not quite as valuable as the studio thinks.</p>

<p>Neither of these games have managed to topple&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>as the best-selling games of 2025 year-to-date. Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>is in third place, largely because of its release on PS5 in late April.</p>

<p>As ever, Nintendo's chart is off in its own little world, since many of the aforementioned games weren't released for the Switch. That platform's best-selling game for May was&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, because of course it was, followed by&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-8-circana-may-2025-sales-data.jpg?itok=KVGhNMbr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-8-circana-may-2025-sales-data.jpg?itok=emHkJEZM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart 8&nbsp;</em>was May's best-selling game on the Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>As ever, Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjuopr2jc2j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full thread</a> is well worth a look. It's got plenty of stats on things like hardware sales and the mobile market as well, so be sure to give it a glance if you're into your numbers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like UFOs, ball lightning and bigfoot, one of the great mysteries of our time is that Superman is apparently Kryptonite to good videogames. There's yet to be a truly great Kal-El game in the vein of Batman: Arkham Asylum or Spider-Man, but as you can see from the list below, many have tried. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest developer to try is Epic Games, as the Man of Steel has landed as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down">Fortnite X Superman</a>, the latest crossover event for one of the world's biggest games. But what does his inclusion in Fortnite involve? Our list takes a look at that, as well as taking you through a history of Superman in pixels. Discover where you can find Superman as a hero, a playable guest character or just a cheeky Easter Egg in the words below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Official Superman Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These are "true" and "proper" Superman games, experiences where you embody the Man of Steel himself. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1978)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1978-1752064304232.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This Atari 2600 release marks Superman's debut to gamers, all four kilobytes of him. It might not seem much to look at today, but won positive reviews for its action and graphics back in ye olde 1970s. In the role of Superman, players have to rebuild a bridge at the Metropolis waterfront damaged by Lex Luthor, capture your evil nemesis, and return to the Daily Planet as quickly as possible. Complicating things are the fact that Lois Lane has been kidnapped, Luthor has released Krytonite satellites that can deactivate your powers, and there are henchmen waiting to take you down. Using your powers, you can see beyond the area you're in with X-ray vision and then fly in to grab and drop Lex and his goons into jail. Just remember to use phone booths to change back into your Clark Kent clothes before stopping by the Daily Planet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1987)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1987-1752064384942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Jump forward almost a decade and our favorite alien adoptee found his way to the NES, and got a cute 8-bit makeover in the process. For this outing Superman gets a bunch of abilities including super hearing, x-ray vision, heat vision, super spin, and not one but two types of super breath. He needs them to take on not just Lex Luthor but also Kryptonian bad guys Ursa, Non and General Zod. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1988)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1988-1752064802318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later, Superman leveled up for the Taito arcade game. Notable for having its own original villain Emperor Zaas, this time around Kal-El also got to use his fists, his feet and a Sonic Blast ability. A mix of sidescroller, action adventure and fighting game, it had a mixed reception, but snapping up one of these arcade machines today will set you back around $4,000. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel (1989)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752064919125.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 1989 on both the ZX Spectrum and Amiga, Superman: The Man of Steel was split into flying levels, a side scrolling beat ‘em up, and a vertical scrolling battle in battle in space. The story that linked those levels was told with cute comic book page panels. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Death and Return of Superman</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-death-and-return-1752065289255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1994, a pre-Warcraft Blizzard Entertainment released The Death and Return of Superman, a beat ‘em up featuring five playable flavors of the Man of Steel; the vanilla original, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator. Doomsday is the opening act’s big bad, and bio-genetically engineered monster Clawster also makes an appearance. The action was focused on melee combat and airborne projectile attacks. Fun fact: one of the game’s artists and producers, Samwise Didier - who just retired in 2023 - was later responsible for the addition of the Pandaren race to World of Warcraft in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-64-1752065562597.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Also known as Superman: The New Superman Adventure, this Nintendo 64 Supes game is infamous among retro gamers for its terrible execution. Created as a spin off from Superman: The Animated Series, it was the first time our blue boy scout has appeared in a 3D game, though he probably should have skipped the opportunity. It was called out for visual flaws like its Kryptonite fog (which crudely disguised a very short draw distance), terrible controls and a bizarre race mode.  IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">reviewed it</a> in 1999, and we weren't fans. "With horrible control, unforgivable framerates and more bugs than can be counted, [developer] Titus should be absolutely ashamed of this awful game, and the company should be doubly ashamed for pissing all over such a beloved license," said our reviewer. "Do not buy this piece of garbage."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: Shadow of Apokolips</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-countdown-to-apokolips-1752065647548.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily Superman 64 wasn’t the end of the road for Kal-El’s adventures in video games, and the PlayStation 2/GameCube third person action game Shadow of Apokolips was better received than its predecessor. Its story saw Lex Luthor team up with Darkseid and the Intergang crime syndicate, and featured voice acting from Malcolm McDowell, Michael York and Lori Petty. "It's a thrill to finally play a Superman game that's handled with this much care and keen observation, with regard to control and special abilities," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/26/superman-shadow-of-apokolips-ps2-review">said our reviewer</a>, before branding it a "a slightly better-than-decent action game."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752065722366.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the events of Superman: Y2K and featuring Brainiac 13, Xbox’s alternative to Shadow of Apokalips, released in the same year, was another disappointment for Superman fans. "Superman: The Man of Steel is, at the very best, a weekend rental. It'll take about 10 hours to complete, mainly because it's so impossible to beat the missions thanks to the controls," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/08/superman-the-man-of-steel-review">wrote IGN's reviewer</a>. "Someday someone is going to get Superman right and make a killer game. But not today."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman Returns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-returns-1752065805859.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2006 was the last time Superman got to star in his very own game, but unfortunately it was a game where the final boss was a tornado, rather than an exciting supervillain. Very loosely based on the Bryan Singer movie, star Brandon Routh actually leant his voice to the game, although he "sounds about as interested in saving Metropolis as he is in deciding on a ripe melon at the market," according to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/28/superman-returns-review-2">IGN review</a>. "Punching out bad guys becomes about as fun as taking out the garbage, and the “epic” battle between Superman and the forces of evil is as simple and dull as a day of chores."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Playable Characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These games are not <em>about</em> Superman, but they do <em>feature</em> Superman... and you can play as him, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Justice League Task Force</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/justice-league-task-force-1752065910131.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's 1995. You've fired up your SNES, eaten your Honey Frosted Wheaties and your best friend is coming over to play your new fighting game. Justice League Task Force, developed by Blizzard Entertainment (wow, these guys sure loved DC before they got into orcs and elves) featured Superman alongside characters like The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow battling mechanical clones of the DC heroes. Despite rocky reviews, the Justice League fighting series would get another three games, and Superman is a playable fighter in them all. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/mk-vs-dc-1752066011837.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In a world where Leatherface is a guest character in the Mortal Kombat series, a mash up between MK and a comic book universe looks positively tame. This 2008 crossing of the streams is the result of not just a canny guy in the licensing department at DC, but because Raiden and Superman accidentally create big bad Dark Kahn, who threatens both their universes. Superman has moves like Soaring Knockout, Ice Breath, and the Heroic Brutality finishers where he hammers his opponent into the ground like a rusty nail, or freezes them before shattering their bodies to pieces. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-batman-2-1752066181998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman gets a mention in the first Lego Batman game, but in Lego Batman 2, Lego Batman 3 and Lego DC Super-Villains he's a playable character. You get most brawn for your buck in the second Lego Batman game, where he's a big part of the story (and comes complete with his signature theme tune, taken from the classic Christopher Reeves films). He rescues the Dark Knight and Robin, takes on a large Joker robot, and helps his Bat Buddy defend Wayne Tower. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice: Gods Among Us</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-1752066301942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman appears on the roster of NetherRealm’s fighting game, Injustice, but as it's set in Earth-49 he's the spicy bad version, driven mad by the death of Lois Lane, and so gets to be a villain. He brings all the tricks you'd expect to the 1v1 matches; heat vision, Ground Tremor, and freezing Super Breath. His Super Move - the Kryptonian Smash - is brutal, he literally punches his opponent into space before punching them back down to Earth. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-2-1752066325552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And Super(bad)man came back for the sequel, with a new Final Flight Super Move that again sees him punching his opponent upwards, this time giving them a few wallops in the sky before slamming them into the ground. You can also add Meteor Drop to that too, where you introduce your opponent to the wonders of geology at close quarters. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Dimensions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-dimensions-superman-1752066392988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 game that used a Skylanders-style mix of real world figures and in-game content added the “Superman starring DC Comics fun pack” in 2016. By grabbing the Superman minifigure, players could get access to his Hoverpod and the DC Comics World in-game, opening up the glittering city of Metropolis. Admittedly, it’s a version of Metropolis that The Lord of the Rings villain Sauron has installed one of his creepy sky eyes into, but that’s about on par with the many other evils the city has had to contend with over the years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MultiVersus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/multiversus-superman-1752066523612.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. free to play fighting game MultiVersus was shut down just this year, but while it lived it was a fever dream where an eclectic mix of WB franchise characters faced off in platform-based, Super Smash-like combat. Superman was there along with his DC compadres Black Adam and Wonder Woman, but then so was Velma from Scooby-Doo, Gizmo from Gremlins, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Jake The Dog from Adventure Time, and Looney Tunes pin-up Lola Bunny. Oh, and you could dress them in skins, so Ugly Sweater Superman was a real thing that existed in the world for a short, beautiful time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This category is for the games where there's the barest whiff of Superman spandex. Little details hidden in the game world, special skins, or if you're lucky, an evil cameo. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/scribblenauts-unmasked-superman-1752066652770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This super cute 2013 spin off has you help Superman with a Lex Luthor problem and lets you summon him to help you in other battles, too. Using the right words you can call on a bunch of different Kal-El variants, from Cyborg Superman to Kingdom Come Superman, and you can even borrow a Superman costume to grant main character Maxwell heat vision and ice breath attacks. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Universe Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/dc-universe-online-1752066785472.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The DC Comics MMO lets players create their own personalized brand of superhero (or supervillain) but Superman makes an appearance as a mentor for new superhero players, taking them through tutorial missions. He can also be found in the in-game Metropolis and appears as an ally to support players with his skillset. If you choose to be a villain you'll need to battle him as you level up. You can also try out a Superman avatar in the game's PvP mode, Legends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman Arkham Knight </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/arkham-knight-1752066855218.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While you won't catch a glimpse of the hench hero in Rocksteady’s fantastic Batman Arkham series, there are multiple references to him in the third game's world. There are posters for flights to Metropolis, a few LexCorp buildings dotted around Gotham City, and the NPC thugs seem to enjoy gossiping about Superman on the regular. They call him "that freak from Metropolis," and "the other guy in the cape" and speculate on his alter ego. ""Next thing you know, someone's gonna tell me Superman's really a janitor. Or no, a journalist." Oh, if they only knew.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ss-superman-1752066974221.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Superman makes a dramatic entrance in Rocksteady’s ill-fated 2024 follow up for the Arkham series, appearing just in time to grab a nuke, laugh maniacally, and take on the Suicide Squad in a boss fight. He delivers some pretty weak sauce villain banter until you can bring him down to Earth with Gold Kryptonite assisted violence. The poor guy doesn't even get to play the top boss in the game; that role is taken in the finale by one of many Brianiacs. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">LittleBigPlanet 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lbp-superman-1752067193664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A tiny Sackboy Superman skin and outfit based on the iconic hero, complete with adorable Superman forehead curl? Perfect. No notes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Minecraft</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/minecraft-superman-1752067292896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate the release of the new James Gunn Superman movie, Minecraft has added a bunch of free Superman skins, featuring Lois Lane, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Mr. Terrific and of course, the old red cape and shiny suit. Previously, players could add some super to their world with the Superheroes Unlimited mod, which was first released in 2012. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fortnite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/fortnite-superman-1752067417284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Fortnite X Superman event, launched to coincide with the new James Gunn movie, adds a Kal-El themed battle pass that culminates in a skin based on David Corenswet’s version of the iconic superhero. There’s also an in-game item that will unlock Supes’ heroic abilities, allowing you to wipe the floor in a battle royale match. While this is the most prominent use of Superman in Fortnite to date, it’s not actually his first appearance: back in 2021, Chapter 2, Season 7 featured a Superman skin that had two styles; one featuring the suit and cape, and another that transformed you into the more civilian-looking Clark Kent, complete with glasses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blitz Royale, Fortnite's biggest new mode in years, just got a four-week extension — as speculation mounts over whether Epic Games will make its faster-paced battle royale offering a permanent addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a just-posted in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> news update, as seen by IGN, developer Epic Games has confirmed "4 More Weeks of Blitz," beginning next week on July 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the date that the mode's current month-long roster of content had been set to end. Already, fans are celebrating that the mode isn't going anywhere — at least, not for few weeks. But will Blitz now become permanent? While no confirmation has yet been given, there are some promising signs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-has-a-hit-new-mode-and-for-once-the-games-main-battle-royale-option-is-no-longer-the-most-popular">Blitz Royale launched last month as a quickfire take on battle royale</a>, with matches designed to last just five minutes. Initially aimed at Fortnite's smartphone audience, the mode instead quickly found popularity across all platforms, and has since become the game's most-played experience — consistently beating even the main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists in publicly-viewable player numbers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To a large degree, Blitz Royale has been a huge success for Epic Games, after a string of previously-released new modes that haven't captured the same audience as the game's core battle royale offerings. Surely, you would then think, Blitz Royale becoming permanent is a safe bet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ff315cfe-e252-4ae9-8ce5-2f8a0bbfd703-1752073265972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite confirms more Blitz Royale is on the way. Image credit: Epic Games/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are likely to be other considerations here — a need to keep the mode updated with content regularly enough that it never becomes stale, a need to balance development time with work on other modes, and, perhaps, a sense that the mode becoming permanent risks robbing it of some of its novelty. Consider the millions who originally tuned in when Fortnite ran its time-limited OG throwback season, compared to the (mere!) tens of thousands who play it today in its guise as a permanent mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In typically teasing fashion, Epic Games held a social media poll last week asking fans what they would most like to see within Blitz in the future. "We've seen a lot of 'make Blitz permanent'," Epic wrote, "but what should we change?" Options included new POIs, more collab items, new boons and powers, and "more Megalo Don plz," referencing the villain of Fortnite Chapter 5, and his Nitro fuel that enables Blitz players to run faster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen a lot of "make Blitz permanent", but what should we change?</p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1940848241895203051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The past three weeks have seen Blitz Royale revive classic weaponry and gameplay-changing modifiers from past Battle Royale seasons, and even previous collaboration items — such as the airbending powers of Avatar — across week-long sprints. Currently, the (now no longer final) Blitz week features items from the game's previous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on what Blitz will focus on for its second month in the game — but at least now players know it is sticking around a while longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/primal-planet-lets-you-hug-your-dinosaur-oh-and-its-an-excellent-metroidvania-too</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/primal-planet-lets-you-hug-your-dinosaur-%E2%80%93-oh-and-it%E2%80%99s-an-excellent-metroidvania-too.1239363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been playing video games since about 1982, and Primal Planet stands out among the most charming I’ve ever encountered. While there’s not a lot about it that’s especially new, the components are so lovingly tuned and crafted that I could barely bring myself to stop playing. The designer injected Primal Planet with an inexhaustible reservoir of creativity, color, motion, and wonder, and the combination delivers an absolutely captivating play experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its charm starts with the hugs. I’ve been in love with superfluous embraces in games since the WayForward remake of A Boy and His Blob deployed a deeply rewarding hug button. With a tap, you could reach out as the Boy and squeeze your best friend the Blob to your heart’s content. The sweetness of the animation and sound design compelled me to hug my little extraterrestrial friend whenever he succeeded, and often to comfort him when he failed. Primal Planet operates from the same emotional playbook. It doesn’t give you much manual control over displays of affection, but works in plenty of opportunities to warmly embrace and interact with your wife, daughter, and the adorable Sino the Dino. It’s deeply committed to integrating utterly unnecessary but deeply rewarding moments of humanity, where your little pixel people feel truly human. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Primal Planet - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveman protagonist has a family of bot buddies accompanying him on his journey, and thankfully these AI companions are genuinely helpful. They follow you without getting lost and contribute meaningfully to combat. You can opt to carry your daughter or put her down for support, and your wife is a menace to enemies with her bow and arrow. They’re also deeply emotive characters, enough so that you get attached to them... an emotional hook that Primal Planet finds plenty of opportunities to exploit.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Yes, you can hug the dinosaur.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all my friends and family, I bonded most with Sino the Dino, a baby dinosaur that acted as a sort of friendly attack dog fighting alongside me. Some of that attachment is that Sino really is useful, and part of it is that the poor little guy is an orphan and I feel a bit responsible for him. I also love that unlike my caveman, Sino can eat small enemies to restore his health on the fly, making him remarkably durable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The day and night cycles dynamically alter the visibility and danger in the sprawling world. Locales that at dawn are gorgeous vistas transform after dark into menacing hunting grounds. The backgrounds are absolutely crammed with visual splendor. Almost every pixel has a sense of motion to it, from blades of tall grass blowing in the wind to the gentle breathing of immense, sleeping dinosaurs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the dinosaurs: they’re undeniably awesome. Look, dinosaurs are simply the coolest creatures to ever walk this earth, and Primal Planet knows that, presenting these astronomical ancient avians with a Jurassic Park-like level of enthusiasm. The dinos are diverse in appearance and behavior, deeply colorful and behaviorally distinct. Compys scurry about like the little scavengers they are, raptors attack in packs and from hiding, and the big fellas are genuinely terrifying. The pixel art style and careful color choices richly infuse these colossal beasts with grandeur, beauty, and terror.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, Primal Planet is rock solid. It’s a side-scrolling Metroidvania that gets platforming, combat, and exploration right. The levels are artistically lush but also cunningly designed to hide (and tease) secrets, alternate paths, and environmental puzzles. Curiosity is always rewarded, sometimes with jarring (but terrific) surprises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a world of quick death and constant twists and turns, but it doesn’t feel brutal or unfair, instead merely challenging. You’ve got a potent dodgeroll to keep you out of harm’s way, and your little dude is delightfully agile. Whether you’re battling dinos, rival tribes, or space aliens, encounters feel thoughtfully designed and balanced.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Primal Planet includes well-designed progression and crafting systems. XP gathered through battle and exploration fuels Skill Points, which in turn can be used to unlock double jumps, weapon proficiencies, and more. You share your Skill Point pool and XP with Sino, and can considerably upgrade his mobility and combat abilities as the game goes on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resources found can be crafted at bonfires into weapons, tools, and medicine. The resources are neither too abundant nor too scarce... distribution feels just right. And some items double as equipment. Craft a spear from flint and wood and you’ve got a decent melee and ranged weapon, but you can also toss it against walls and use it as a climbing platform, or dip it in a fire to create a torch useful for clearing thorns that block your path. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the campaign continues, you meet new allies that help you unlock more crafting abilities, allowing you to create potent traps and weapons to scale with the ever-escalating threats. Resource gathering never felt like a chore, but rather as a reward for exploring and following hunches to hidden areas where rare items and components waited to be found. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like Primal Planet was designed especially for me. It combines several of my favorite reagents in gaming into one glorious magic potion. When I boot up Primal Planet I arrive at an intersection of prehistoric beasts, science fiction, excellent exploratory platforming, incredible art, a light progression system, and a dash of the feels. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling. Show-don’t-tell is the name of the game in Primal Planet, and it’s splendidly executed. Whether it's UFOs beaming up dinosaurs in the background or your family stopping to create a cave painting together after a major story beat, Primal Planet just keeps intriguing and surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Primal Planet doesn’t really do anything revolutionary, I have rarely enjoyed a game more. Its creator seems to have surveyed the spectrum of components that make up a compelling video game adventure, and fine-tuned them into a deeply rewarding experience that evokes great Metroidvanias while feeling new and distinct. I absolutely cannot wait for the full release. Don’t sleep on Primal Planet. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><em>Jared Petty really, really, really likes dinosaurs.

                <p>Sorry, Valve, but it seems that you aren't the top dog on your own storefront anymore, at least when it comes to having the highest-rated game on Steam anyway. For a long while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/portal-2/" data-ref-id="5000-70564">Portal 2</a> has gone unchallenged in its top-rated spot on Steam, but as tracked by <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" rel="nofollow ">Steam Top 250</a>, none other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> has moved above it. Mind, the difference in rating is quite minimal, but nonetheless Eric "ConceredApe" Barone's beloved farming sim is currently the highest-rated game on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably worth noting that Steam Top 250 explains that the scores assigned to each game are based on two things: number of votes, and the approval rating, i.e. percentage, of positive votes. Stardew Valley has just under 900,000 votes, more than double the amount of votes that Portal 2 has, 436,665. The former technically has a one percent lower count of positive votes compared to the latter, but it's that ratio of positive votes to overall votes that has net Stardew Valley the top spot.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Interestingly, when looking at the top 10 highest-rated games across Steam, most of them have been around for at least a few years, if not a lot longer, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vampire-survivors/" data-ref-id="5000-544864">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead-2/" data-ref-id="5000-43544">Left 4 Dead 2</a>, and the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/portal/" data-ref-id="5000-27599">Portal</a>. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> is also there in ninth place, a game that only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/" data-ref-id="1100-6530401">just launched in early access in March of this year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A big new update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-hits-new-peak-concurrents-record-on-steam-thanks-to-update-1-6/1100-6521971/">did arrive in Stardew Valley last year</a>, and while Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">hasn't ruled out making a Stardew Valley 2 eventually</a>, right now he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">back to working</a> on his follow-up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/" data-ref-id="5000-540129">Haunted Chocolatier</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3’s</a> release set for October, Frontier has started to reveal some of the major new gameplay ideas and, even more exciting, the new species that are coming to the game. Introducing the Lokiceratops:</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Lokiceratops | Dinosaur Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkCPulJqhT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yes, the Lokiceratops was named after the Norse god Loki, but not (just?) because of how handsome Tom Hiddlestone was around the time this dinosaur species was discovered in 2019 – first found in northern Montana. No, it’s actually down to the distinctive horns that they have around their frill.</p>
<p>There’s certainly some similarities to the Triceratops, you might say, and just as with that iconic dionsaur, this late cretaceous species is a herbivore. They can live together in small groups along with herbivores and ceratopsids, teaming up to defend their young from any threats.</p>
<p>In Jurassic World Evolution 3, you’ll have to care for Lokiceratops in family units, ensuring that they have nests and have privacy to allow for breeding to take place between male and female dinos – none of this frog DNA to mess around with anymore. They’ll also just need plenty of space and vegetation to feel comfortable, so the ogling hordes shouldn’t get too close regardless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/jurassic-world-evolution-3-revealed-and-its-coming-out-in-october/">Jurassic World Evolution 3 launches 21 October 2025</a> across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. We’re four years removed from the last game in the series, which we award a stonking (stomping?) 9/10.</p>
<p>“Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original’s rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you’re a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn’t love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> Remake chatter has started <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-cant-be-bought-on-steam-due-to-a-technical-issue-not-an-incoming-remake-ubisoft-insists">reverberating around the decks of the internet again</a> recently, like a mighty sea shanty that Ubisoft won't say much about.</p>
<p>With folks keener for new info than they are booty, an update to the original Black Flag's Steam backend is the latest thing to fan the Remake speculation flames, but before you get excited about it, it's worth bearing in mind that a bunch of other Assassin's Creed games got similar tweaks yesterday.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This update to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/242050/history/">Black Flag's Steam listing</a> was deployed exactly four seconds before 10AM UK time, and enabled a bunch of new store categories for it. They're for functions/features like "Adjustable Difficulty" and "Custom Volume Controls", with a "Mouse Only Option" and the ability to manually save at any time also mentioned.</p>
<p>Cue some speculation from fans and <a href="https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/matthew-wilson/ubisoft-preparing-for-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-announcement/">headlines</a> wondering what the addition of features that aren't in the original Black Flag might mean for the remake project that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reportedly in the works</a> at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Hold your mainsails, though. Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One, whose post about the Steam update looks to have gotten this speculation shanty going, has <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1942620544442179807">seemingly acknowledged</a> after sending that tweet that the Steam listings for <em>every</em> Assassin's Creed game released since 2014 got updates like that Black Flag one yesterday.
</p>
<p>Before you accuse me of wasting your time just to drop a 'womp, womp' worthy revelation like that, I've done a bit of extra work looking into these Steam updates, just in case they do turn out to mean something worth noting. While some of the updates to other AC games, such as the one for <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/368500/history/">Syndicate</a>, are carbon copies of the Black Flag one, there are some differences: no more <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/289650/history/">"family sharing"</a> for AC Unity, a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/812140/history/">"keyboard only option"</a> for Odyssey, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3035570/history/">"camera comfort"</a> for Mirage.</p>
<p>We've also asked Ubisoft for comment. I personally want to know how you make a video game's cameras so comfortable it's worth noting in a store listing, and why you can seemingly no longer share some Parissassinating with your great uncle Bert. The people deserve to be informed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-steam-update-sparks-more-remake-speculation-but-hold-fire-sailor]]></content:encoded>

This is a good thing for those who are worried about spoilers, but some players are concerned that an accelerated rollout might impact the broader gacha mechanics and meta.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196394" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On July 9, Atlus held <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/CaXpbgEgWB4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CaXpbgEgWB4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a></span> to break down <em>The Phantom X</em>’s 1.1 update.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-switch-2-and-steam-deck-face-off-in-cyberpunk-2077-benchmark-test</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-switch-2-and-steam-deck-face-off-in-cyberpunk-2077-benchmark-test.1239306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry is back with another Switch 2 video; this time looking at how the console holds up next to the Steam Deck when benchmark testing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot to get into with this, so we'll let the video do most of the talking, but in a nutshell, we're looking at multiple benchmark tests in docked and handheld mode with the Switch 2, including CDPR's 'official' test, the Kabuki run test, and The Beast In Me test.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Switch 2 is leagues ahead of the Steam Deck when docked, with much better image quality thanks to DLSS, and a much more consistent frame rate in quality mode. In performance mode, during which the Switch 2 targets 40fps, there's a lot more inconsistency, but it still manages to outclass the Steam Deck for the most part.</p>
<p>Handheld mode is a different story. Performance mode isn't available for the Switch 2 in handheld, so we're looking at a target of 30fps, but interestingly, Nintendo's new console showcases slightly more instability than the Steam Deck during both the Kabuki run and The Beast In Me (albeit at a higher resolution). That said, the Switch 2 is much, <em>much</em> more efficient, drawing around 8.9w compared to the Steam Deck's 24.5w. Essentially, the Switch 2 is able to almost match the Steam Deck's performance using just 36% of the latter's power.</p>
<p>In fact, when lowering the power draw in the Steam Deck to match that of the Switch 2, the Steam Deck effectively runs in slow motion, with frame rate dropping to around 9-13fps. Of course, this won't mean a whole lot in real world use cases, but it's interesting to see the stark difference between the two.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that when replicating the Switch 2's performance on PC, a lot of the settings, including crowd density, contact shadows, volumetric cloud, and more are actually quite similar to that of the PS5 in performance mode. Not bad at all for Nintendo's new hardware!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stalker 2 PS5 Version Confirmed for Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-ps5-version-confirmed-for-later-this-year.1239303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has revealed that its post-apocalyptic RPG shooter&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>

<p>The announcement of the game's PS5 port was made via a rather amusing new trailer, which features a familiar character from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>. I won't spoil its surprises, but you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> if you'd like to watch it.</p>

<p>According to GSC Game World, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will utilize the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features for "deeper player immersion", so presumably, that'll manifest in the form of trigger resistance for guns and various other fun little features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=9VWh0-ID 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=zJcgxK19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is hitting PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will feature a number of enhancements for the PS5 Pro, so you can add the shooter to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of games with extra features</a> for the souped-up version of Sony's hardware.</p>

<p>Other than that, though, it sounds like this will very much be the same&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>with which you may already be familiar. It doesn't sound like GSC Game World will be adding any extra content for the PS5 release, so you won't be missing out if you don't pick it up on Sony's platform.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(not counting prequel <i>Clear Sky&nbsp;</i>or standalone sequel&nbsp;<em>Call of Pripyat</em>, although the latter does take place after&nbsp;<em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>).</p>

<p>The game follows new protagonist Skif, who must explore the Exclusion Zone in search of ways to make money to replace his destroyed home (at least, that's how the game opens; it takes some interesting turns after that which I won't spoil).</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's coming to PS5 in "late 2025", according to GSC Game World.</p>

            <p>I Don't Want To Be A Good Woman is an abstract walking simulator that depicts the experience of being a young girl in Iran - a country that, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154306">as characterised by UN human rights investigators in September 2024</a>, operates "a system, both in law and in practice, that fundamentally discriminates on the grounds of gender". It takes the form of a molten grey landscape strewn with faceless figures, floating symbols and text.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Play consists of wandering around, witnessing frozen scenes and reading text based on stories the developers We Remember have "heard, gathered, or lived ourselves". The devs have omitted names and their own identities, which I am naturally a bit uneasy about, but the anonymity is to be expected given the Iranian state's <a href="https://iran-shutdown.amnesty.org/">track record for brutal censorship</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3779700/I_Dont_Want_To_Be_A_Good_Woman/">Find it on Steam</a>. Needless to say, I wouldn't play this one lightly. Here is how the developers describe the subject matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>This experience explores real-life challenges faced by women in Iran under Islamic law, including gender-based discrimination, restricted bodily autonomy, and limitations on freedom of expression. Themes such as forced hijab, lack of reproductive rights, and state violence are presented through a narrative lens. While the game contains no explicit imagery, it does involve mature social and political themes.</p>
<p>The game depicts discriminatory behavior toward women by state and religious systems from the perspective of a victim. These portrayals are not meant to promote hate or disparagement, but to raise awareness of real-world issues through an empathetic and objective narrative.</p> </blockquote>
<p>We've covered a few projects that address Iran's society and politics and its recent history. Back in 2013, Adam Smith (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-tehran-1979-revolution-black-friday">wrote about 1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a>, an adventure game created by Iranian developers based inside and outside the country, which casts you as a photojournalist during the overthrow of the (originally CIA and MI6-backed) Pahlavi dynasty.</p>
<p>You might also want to check out this <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/iran-video-games-timeline-from-1970-to-2019">abbreviated history of Iranian video game development</a> for Game Developer, written by Iranian journalist and designer Arash Hackimi in 2020. It spans the creation or importing of new hardware, from the Magnavox Odyssey-esque Video Master through bootlegged Atari 2600s to modern mobile phones; the arrival of Iranian video game magazines, such as Bazi Rayane; the origins of the first Iranian video game developer, Honafa; and the founding of video game festivals, like the Digital Media Festival in 2007.</p>
<p>Hackimi also details a few individual games, including the perpetual motion drawing tool <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/415170/Engare/">Engare</a>, the fantasy action-adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353990/Parvaneh_Legacy_of_the_Lights_Guardians/">Parvaneh</a> and <a href="http://farsh.golabistudio.com/">Farsh</a>, a puzzle game about unrolling carpets. All of which might surprise you if, like me, your understanding of Iran in video games begins and mostly ends with the likes of Prince of Persia.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-dont-want-to-be-a-good-woman-is-a-museum-of-resilience-that-explores-sexism-and-repression-in-iran]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> finally has a new update with much-needed performance improvements and tweaks to the difficulty settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda said update 1.2 focuses on fixes for quests, gameplay, and performance, and includes new damage settings. 1.2 won’t roll out to all platforms just yet, Bethesda added, but it will be released today, July 9, on Steam Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch was much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (although that's since fallen to 'mostly positive'). However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged playthrough, Morgan revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game. The update 1.2 patch notes, below, include "Fixed player character height scaling," which may be a fix for this specific issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” DF continued. That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Razer has a new collaboration in the works with Pokemon, having teased the news on social media. It will be officially revealed later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">The gaming company shared a post on Twitter on July 7, with the question, "Are you ready for a new journey?" while tagging the official Pokemon account, along with the date and time of the announcement for July 17 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. A short video with yellow fonts on a black background with the Razer logo pulsing with electricity suggests that this could be Pikachu-related.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on replies from Razer's account (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/pokemon-tease" rel="nofollow ">PCGamesN</a>), it seems this may be a collaboration that won't be region-locked, as has been the case with Razer and Pokemon partnerships in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Razer has already previously released gaming peripherals featuring Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee, but these had only been limited to a few regions, excluding the US. It's not clear whether this will include past collab products or something completely new, but wider availability will certainly be appreciated by Pokemon fans who haven't been able to get hold of a Pokemon keyboard or mouse, at least not without braving scalpers.</p><p dir="ltr">There's plenty of other partnerships Razer has with other major gaming brands, including Minecraft and Roblox, but a new Pokemon partnership will no doubt be a very hot item. That also comes ahead of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/">Pokemon Presents Livestream</a> happening on July 22, where we expect there will be more news on Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Dynasty mode is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and rightfully so. You're given the reigns of an entire school program and entrusted with making every decision regarding the team you put on the field. At the start of a Dynasty playthrough, you're able to pick your school and whether you're a head coach or offensive/defensive coordinator. If you choose to be a head coach, you then need to decide if you're going to use the school's real-life coach or design your own coach.</p><p>If you opt for the latter option, you get to fully customize your coach's appearance just like you would a custom player in Road to Glory. However, creating a custom coach also means you need to select a Coach Archetype, which can be a tricky task in College Football 26. To see the differences between the three Archetypes and which one you should pick, check out the guide below.</p><h2>What are the Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode?</h2><p>If you played any College Football 25, then the Dynasty Archetypes will be familiar, as they're the same ones that are in College Football 26. There are three in total, and they are:</p><ul><li>Motivator (example: Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame)</li><li>Recruiter (example: Dan Lanning, Oregon)</li><li>Tactician (example: Steve Starkisian, Texas)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601"></a><figcaption>The three Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg"></figure><p>Your decision in a Coach Archetype determines the coaching abilities you have access to early on in a Dynasty playthrough. It also plays a pivotal role in deciding what kind of coach you're going to be and where your strengths lie, both on and off the field.</p><p>When it comes to the coaching abilities you can unlock, every ability has a certain classification. You'll immediately unlock your Archetype's first coaching ability after starting a Dynasty playthrough, and you can unlock more abilities within that Archetype as you progress. However, you can still unlock abilities from other Archetypes, so picking one Archetype doesn't prevent you from being a well-rounded coach in CFB 26.</p><p>The first ability you have unlocked can be progressed to become more advanced, though. For example, if you pick the Recruiter Archetype, you'll immediately unlock the Firm Handshakes ability. This gives you 100 bonus XP for signing a recruit. This ability can be upgraded to Elite Recruiter with enough XP, which has even stronger benefits.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602"></a><figcaption>A look at the coaching abilities in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg"></figure><h2>Best Coach Archetype to pick in College Football 26</h2><p>So, which is the best one to pick? Truthfully, you can't go wrong with any of the selections, as all three Archetypes cover important coaching areas that come with perks you'll want to have in Dynasty mode.</p><p>However, if we were to rank the Archetypes, here's where they would stand:</p><ol><li>Recruiter</li><li>Motivator</li><li>Tactician</li></ol><p>Recruiter is simply the best overall Coach Archetype for your long-term Dynasty playthrough. The other Archetypes focus on player ratings for the most part, and while that will help you win games, there's still an element of skill you need to have.</p><p>On the other hand, the Recruiter Archetype gives you perks that allow you to build a stronger team in the long run. Recruiter allows you to recruit much better players and develop a more efficient scouting process throughout a Dynasty playthrough. Without the Recruiter Archetype and abilities, you'll have a rough time trying to convince players to sign with your program until you manage to unlock some Recruiter abilities.</p><p>What it really comes down to is you can fully control what happens on the field, regardless of whether your players' ratings are boosted or not with the Motivator or Tactician Archetypes. However, you'll have a much harder time controlling what happens in the recruiting process if you don't select the Recruiter Archetype. It helps eliminate some RNG and frustration from a Dynasty playthrough and saves you heaps of time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603"></a><figcaption>Architect is one of the abilities you want to work towards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg"></figure><p>You also have to consider that Motivator and Tactician don't start out with great abilities. You'll have to work your way to abilities such as Architect and Strategist in addition to leveling up the Recruiter abilities. With Recruiter, you can max out your Recruiter abilities or go for some of the other ones to gain strength in additional areas.</p><p>Of course, choosing an Archetype also comes down to personal preference and what you enjoy when you play Dynasty in CFB 26. If you feel you'll really benefit from having players' ratings boosted, then go with Motivator or Tactician. Motivator is the better choice overall since Tactician only boosts players' ratings on gameday, but pick whichever one you feel good about.</p>

                <p>Sounds like Disney is cooking up something in the world of video games. A couple of job listings went up on the Disney Careers website at the end of last month, for <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/california/senior-gameplay-engineer/391/83021111648" rel="nofollow ">senior</a> and regular <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/gameplay-engineer/391/83021111392" rel="nofollow ">gameplay engineer</a> positions. As is par for the course for listings like these, what exactly it is you'd be working on wasn't mentioned, but it does say that Disney is "building an expert development team that will be building a groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p dir="ltr">Both roles mention Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, so it sounds like it might be a cross-property project. Notably, it also mentions that having experience in Unreal Editor for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and Verse (the programming language used for UEFN), making it sound like these roles could be for Disney's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/">previously announced metaverse within Fortnite</a>. That deal saw Disney invest $1.5 billion into Epic Games, though we're yet to see any results from it bar the usual collaborations Fortnite features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, prolific Fortnite leaker Hypex shared that this Disney metaverse had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-fortnite-project-reportedly-reaches-a-major-milestone/1100-6529352/" data-ref-id="1100-6529352">moved into a "stable" build/branch</a>, but aside from the initial announcement last year, there's only been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/">small tease</a> about how the house of mouse's theme parks might integrate with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The senior gameplay designer role also makes mention of requiring experience in the prototyping phase of a project, so you probably shouldn't expect this Disney x Fortnite metaverse for a while yet.</p>
