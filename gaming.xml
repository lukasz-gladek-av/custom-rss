      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The updated version will include visual upgrades, story elements, and more, with one of those new story elements is teased in the game's announcement trailer: a mysterious hooded figure approaches the player on a beach, but the camera cuts away before their face is revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Definitive Edition comes as a surprise to many Xenoblade fans, as Monolith Soft executive director Tetsuya Takahashi once said <a href="https://www.vg247.com/xenoblade-chronicles-2-postmortem-breaking-down-the-inaugural-switch-rpgs-success-with-tetsuya-takahashi?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an interview with USGamer</a> that a lack of budget would keep the game from being remade, as it's "a massive game. Re-creating it would be really difficult."</p><p dir="ltr">Xenoblade Chronicles X was first released on April 29, 2015, nearly 10 years to the day before this new Definitive Edition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/1900-6416322/">GameSpot's 8/10 review</a> called it a "truly enormous game," saying that "after as many as 60 hours, X continues to provide taller mountains to climb, and stronger opponents to topple, with no end of new challenges in sight.</p><p dir="ltr">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on March 25 for $60. It's available now for preorder on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo eShop</a>, and it is also included in Nintendo's Game Voucher program.</p>

According to the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029757838/en/">press release</a>, the remaster features enhanced visuals and added story elements.</p><p>Nintendo released a new trailer to mark the occasion and its opening seconds feel hilariously on the nose. There’s something deeply ironic about the trailer for a Switch port of a ten-year old Wii U game starting with the dialogue, “Well, here we are. Not too shabby, huh?” It’s like a tongue-in-cheek joke acknowledging there’s a wealth of Wii U games in desperate need of salvation (<strong>coughs</strong> <em>Wind Waker</em> <strong>coughs</strong>) and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was one of the lucky ones to get a lifeboat off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22988902/nintendo-wiiu-3ds-eshop-closure-dmca-section-1201">sunken, inaccessible ship that is the Nintendo back catalogue</a>. </p><p>In addition to porting old Wii U games, Nintendo’s still releasing new titles in the twilight days of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> is due out next week. Nintendo’s also confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> will get a Switch release too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Call Of Duty: Ops 6 quality assurance staff from Eden Prarie, Minnesota have walked out in protest over Activision's ending of hybrid or remote working, which was announced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">December last year</a>. They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">claim</a> that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">Eurogamer</a>, Activision workers group ABetterABK have also <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">issued a statement</a> criticising the "unequal" ROI policy, which has been in effect for nine months. The ABK union say the move has "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accommodations", who have been refused exemption from the policy. </p>
<p>There's also a reference to staff being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing the USA's National Disability Employment Awareness Month, which falls in October. The email in question apparently "depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," according to the ABK statement. As such, it argues that Activision have "been championing [diversity, equity &amp; inclusion] while they continually fail us."</p>
<p>The walkout is small, with about <a href="https://x.com/cwa7250/status/1849961465442136265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 people shown holding CWA signs in photographs</a>, but it's caught the attention of local media like Fox9. </p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> also have a statement from Activision, in which an Acti spokesperson comments that negotiations around individual employee needs are "ongoing", despite the many months since the policy was introduced.</p>
<p>"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," it reads. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum." </p><p>The Activision QA walkout is one of many clashes between developers and management over the end of hybrid and fully remote-working since the lifting of pandemic lockdown measures. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike in protest</a> at a three-day return to the office mandate which the French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) insists was arrived at "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These Nintendo coupons are $100 for two and can each be used to redeem a single qualifying $60 game. But that’s not all. Stores like Amazon, Newegg, and other virtual currency resellers frequently have limited-time discounts on Nintendo Switch eShop gift cards. Sometimes, they run as much as 10 percent off, or $50 for just $45, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newegg is currently doing</a></span> (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1851286390514073955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1851286390514073955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wario64</a></span>). </p><p>The way the math works out, you’re essentially getting two new $60 games for just $90, a savings of around $30. That’s not a “door buster” deal in the modern world of Black Friday discounts, but for Switch games that are new or rarely go on sale at all, it’s a very good deal. You also get 5 percent back on eShop purchases, so you still come out of the entire exchange with $5 left over in virtual funds. The only hitch is that you need to buy two games, and they need to be digital. </p><p>What games are eligible for this trick? Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updates the qualifying Game Voucher list</a></span> on a rolling basis, but it currently includes this fall’s big Nintendo releases like <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. </em>The vouchers are also good for games that won’t be out until 2025, like <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. Recent releases like <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em>, and <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>also work. Digging into the back catalog like 2023's <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and the normally $70<em> Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are also fair game, although some of those games are likely to get discounted anyway as part of the normal holiday price cuts. </p><p>Plus, my actual favorite thing about the Switch Game Vouchers is that once you commit, it feels like you’re basically getting a game for free. Months after buying them, there’s still a coupon for a free game sitting on your account that you can later redeem for something you might not have normally bought completely guilt-free. Just remember you need Switch Online to buy the vouchers in the first place, and they have to be used within 12 months. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-aek-973-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plethora of weapons</a> to enjoy, but one of the most efficient guns in the game is the AEK-973, a three-round burst DMR that hits hard and can drop enemies in seconds.</p>



<p>To make the most of the Marksman Rifle, here’s the best Black Ops 6 AEK-973 loadout to use, including the attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AEK-973 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best AEK-973 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>, you’ll want a clean Optic like the <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</strong> and the <strong>Suppressor </strong>Muzzle to keep you off the enemy radar when firing the gun.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> provides a boost to bullet velocity and damage range, allowing you to secure kills at long distances. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves the AEK’s handling stats so that you can ADS and fire faster after sprinting. Lastly, but certainly not least, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod gives the Marksman Rifle a major increase to its fire rate, meaning the 3-round bursts come out faster, allowing you to get a faster TTK.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AEK-973</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to Perks, we’ve gone with <strong>Ninja </strong>for quite movement, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for extra minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> to keep you aware of your position being exposed. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong>, which is very useful for seeing the enemy team’s position on the map.</p>



<p>We’ve then selected <strong>Perk Greed </strong>as the Wildcard, which means you can pick a fourth Perk, for which we went with <strong>Flak Jacket</strong>, as Lethal Equipment can be deadly without it.</p>



<p>Speaking of Lethals, the <strong>Impact Grenade</strong> is great for flushing enemies out of tight spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> regenerates your health to get you back in the fight and survive longer.</p>



<p>The <strong>Trophy System</strong> is one of the best Field Upgrades in the game as it protects the team when capturing an objective, hence why we’ve picked it in our best AEK-973 loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-aek-973">Best Secondary for AEK-973</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova </strong>is the best Secondary weapon for the AEK-973, as its a full-auto pistol that performs extremely well at close range. This covers you in close-quarters combat, which is not where the AEK-973 excels.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AEK-973 by reaching <strong>Level 34</strong> in Black Ops 6. You can do this in Multiplayer or Zombies, as progression is shared across these modes. Once Warzone is integrated, you’ll also be able to level up in the Battle Royale too.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to unlock the gun, check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/">top tips on ranking up quickly in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The AEK-973 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in Black Ops 6. It may not be the top of the meta, as those spots are occupied by the strong SMGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assault Rifles</a>, but the three-round burst DMR can outperform any weapon when it’s used to its strengths.</p>



<p>Hold long lines of sight and try not to run and gun too much, this weapon excels when used in positions of power such as high ground and head glitches.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <strong>Swat 5.56</strong> is the obvious alternative to the AEK-973, as it’s also a 3-round burst DMR. It performs similarly to the AEK, but has better accuracy and slightly worse mobility stats. If you want something even more deadly that requires pinpoint accuracy, give our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping LW3A1 Frostline loadout</a> a go.</p>

			<p>It’s always a risk when a series brings back a character whose story was complete and made way for other leads and stories. Sure, it can absolutely be a fan-pleasing follow up, but it can smack of desperation at times – see Marvel bringing back Robert Downey Jr. – or see character shifts as a new writer takes the helm. You never quite know how it will land. I might not have personally cared for Max Caulfield in the original Life is Strange, but developer Deck Nine has brought her back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> complete with all her awkwardness, incessant photograph taking, and interfering with the lives and business of a host of new characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Power and Suspects Trailer - Life is Strange: Double Exposure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIZ03LPvTBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We pick up with Max after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">the events of Arcadia Bay</a> in her new life as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University. She has, since those events, lost her ability to rewind time and the aftermath of the events of her previous adventure weighs heavy on her with flashbacks from time to time littered throughout the story of Double Exposure.</p>


<p>One thing I must highlight that impresses me about Double Exposure is how it handles the absence of Chloe, who was obviously very important in the first game. Instead of Deck Nine picking a canonical ending, they put the choice in your hands, asking what part of the world you elected to decimate in the final moments of Life is Strange. There’s a deft touch to how they explain Chloe’s absence in either scenario.</p>


<p>The story here does take a while to get going, but it really impresses upon you the friendship between Max, Safi and Moses as they simply hang out and chat in a bar or gaze together at the night sky. It doesn’t take long before a murder kicks the story into gear, that initial warmth of the world giving way to multiple plot threads following the intrigue around power held by the Abraxas group within the university, lecturers barely hiding secrets, and the hapless students seemingly stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>The central mystery is a bit of a slow burn, but there’s other plot threads and smaller mysteries for you to unpack that help the the game’s moving along, many of them meshing back into the overarching story as well.</p>
<p>Life is Strange would be nothing without its characters and would definitely not be without some very mixed character work. On the “bad” side, we have the nosey investigative reporter Loretta who rubs Max the wrong way almost immediately, and Vinh’s secrecy and slimy flirting with Max that feels distinctly uncomfortable. But then, on the other hand, you have the fantastic writing of characters like Safi and the instantly likeable potential love interest, Amanda.</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure plays pretty much like any other game in this series. You explore each chapter, interacting with an array of characters, solving small puzzles in the world, and making anxiety-inducing decisions that come complete with the terrifying words “This action will have consequences” appearing on screen. A lot of these decisions, even though they’re simple A or B choices, have lasting impact on the story and game that you might not see for hours, if you even remember choosing it.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, you’ll be given a little breakdown of all the things that you could have impacted on and what you did if you did find them. What’s more, it puts each of these things with a little percentage of players of the game that made each choice. These can be as innocuous as fixing the alignment of some paintings, or as game altering as permanently making an enemy of a character. I must admit that, more than anything else during the review period, this revealed that I’m a terrible person when I play games.</p>
<p>However, this wouldn’t be a Life is Strange game without an interesting gameplay quirk to it and this time Max comes with a brand-new set of powers to replace the ability to rewind time, giving her the far less cool power to move between realities. The main way this ability manifests is being able to physically move between the timeline where your friend has died (known bluntly as the Dead timeline) and another where they are still alive (the Living timeline), allowing you to interact with characters and the world in each.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to locate and speak to the same characters in both timelines to progress or bring items or objects from one to the other, but there is this constant interplay between the two timelines that is used in some clever ways. One particular use that comes to mind was a segment where you need to listen in on a conversation, moving into a different timeline and then reaching back to hear what they’re saying without them noticing.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that this can be a little overwhelming at times, as you have essentially two timelines worth of characters, plotlines and events to contend with. Thankfully, the game has a simple objective system that not only keeps you focused on what you need to do, but also will clearly state which timeline you need to be in to complete the objective. Also, if you need a reminder&nbsp;on the current goings on, and you can bear to read the cringe of it, Max also keeps a handwritten journal of the story so far.</p>

<p>As another thing to praise about Double Exposure, this game has some of the most robust accessibility options available that I think I’ve ever seen. I only dropped into the Options to mess with the sound levels (I like my music loud and my voices not), and there are so many useful toggles allowing you to make subtitles clearer, add warnings about potentially harmful content or even – a life saver for someone as oblivious like I am – add an auditory chime for when you’re close to interactive areas.</p>
<p>It’s great to see games embrace accessibility generally, but this game should be put up there with the best in this regard for the wealth of considerate options here. Also, the ability to toggle whether you want a clear instruction on whether you want to make a particular decision is another excellent addition for me personally. I haven’t had the problem of previous games of accidentally selecting something then having to live with those consequences.</p>
<p>As is the case with the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure hits a very specific aesthetic, blending lowkey chilled Americana with soft indie rock. The university campus is a fresh location but feels distinctly homely and lived in immediately. The cast might look a little too uncanny at times, but they mostly fit in with the environment perfectly and have some phenomenal voice acting. The music too is excellent, even though not quite as prominent as I would like (or as prevalent as it was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/08/life-is-strange-true-colors-review/">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>).</p>

		<p>Rebellion games have revived a British gaming institution, launching a brand new Speedball into Steam Early Access today! The game has a 12-month roadmap planned out, with a full 1.0 launch coming at the end of this path.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball – Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8nNpqK1GG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rebellion’s Speedball will take the core idea of the game series and give it a modern look and feel. This is still a no-holds-barred amped up blend of American Football, Rugby and Football, with thrown passing between players, blood-spilling takedowns and no sign of a referee, whistle or flag in sight. You can take advantage of the specific arenas with various traps and scenery to try and get the advantage.</p>
<p>The Early Access release will feature arcade matches, with play against AI complimented with both online and local multiplayer. There’s plenty to come, though, with a team management and draft system,&nbsp;player and manager progression, Career Mode, skill-based matchmaking and leaderboards, new cosmetics, skins and arenas and more set to be fed into the game over the coming year.</p>
<p>We just hope there’s the rapid hip-wiggling celebration.</p>

<p>A brutal future sport that puts as much emphasis into beating the ever-loving crap out of your opponents as it does actually scoring goals, Speedball first launched in 1988. A bit like Street Fighter, though, it’s Speedball 2 that everyone actually remembers. That was the game that was ported and remade half a dozen times over the years, whether it was a 3D graphics remake for PlayStation, a more contemporary Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe for Xbox Live Arcade, or the traditional Speedball 2 HD which arrived on Steam over a decade ago now. Rebellion acquired the Bitmap Brothers back catalogue in 2019, with this new take on Speedball one of the first fruits of that acquisition.<sup id="cite_ref-16"></sup></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-release-date-west<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and Xseed Games have announced the Western release date for&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em>, and it's launching in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>Last year, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-for-nintendo-switch-gets-new-prologue-trailer">released</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-gameplay-trailer-shows-jrpg-classic-revamped">series</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-for-switch-gets-english-trailer-but-its-not-what-you-think">trailers</a> leading up to the Japanese release of&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em>, but now, we know that the game is arriving on PlayStation and Switch on January 7th in the West.</p>

<p>When it arrives, the game will feature remastered visuals and sound, as well as multiple versions of the soundtrack, several new accessibility options, and new character illustrations, so this is the definitive version of the original game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=Byz5RDpJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=54PTMepf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana&nbsp;</em>is finally heading West.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what exactly&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana&nbsp;</em>is...well, bear with me on this one. It's a remastered version of the 2005 RPG&nbsp;<em>Ys: The Oath in Felghana</em>, which was released in 2010 on PSP (2011 if you were in Europe) and then in 2012 on PC around the world.</p>

<p>That game, however, is also a remake; it's a reimagining of 1990's&nbsp;<em>Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys</em>, so that makes <i>Ys Memoire&nbsp;</i>a remastered version of a remake. I guess that's not too tough to keep up with after all, eh?</p>

<p>In case you're confused, though,&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire&nbsp;</em>is an updated version of the 2005 game rather than the 1990 title. Nihon Falcom and Xseed are calling it "the definitive edition of the acclaimed masterpiece", so I guess if you haven't played any version of&nbsp;<em>Ys 3</em>, this is where to start.</p>




<p>The story of the game revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Adol Christin as he visits Felghana, the homeland of his companion Dogi. While there, Adol is "embroiled in a world of conspiracies and ancient legacies".</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire</em>'s Western release means it's the second&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>game to be released on these shores in the coming months after the release of&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-release-date">earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007319/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on January 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/designer-toby-sarnelle-talks-new-flip-and-write-board-game-tend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ivstudios/tend-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its launch on Kickstarter</a>, I got the chance to playtest the upcoming&nbsp;<i>Tend</i>&nbsp;board game with the game’s designer Toby Sarnelle. After playing an in-person playtest of the spectacular new sci-fi game produced by <a href="https://shop.iv.studio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IV Studio</a>, we spoke at length about the game, his design process, and how it feels to bring his first tabletop board game to life!</p>

<h2>What Is The <em>Tend</em> Board Game?</h2>

<p>Sarnelle described <i>Tend</i> as, “A crunchy farming flip and write game that evokes the feelings of classic farming video games like <i>Harvest Moon</i> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><i>Stardew Valley</i></a>.” And this truly was the experience I had playing the game. From fishing in the lake to mining for ore, growing strange alien plants, and giving gifts to my neighboring players, <i>Tend</i> felt utterly satisfying in this regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Players play as homesteaders on an alien world,” explained Sarnelle, “and will be using shared action cards from an evolving deck as they try to gather a diverse selection of goods to send back home for analysis.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-box.jpg?itok=ixuWud-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-box.jpg?itok=iYf-rEM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Tend</em>&nbsp;game box. Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><h2>The Designer's Journey</h2>

<p>As we played through the game using a prototype more gorgeously designed and produced than some games currently on shelves, I wanted to go back to the start and hear about Sarnelle’s history as a designer. “I started my game design journey 15 years ago at <a href="https://www.stardock.com/games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stardock Entertainment</a>, working on PC strategy games,” Sarnelle explained. He initially started as a marketing web developer, but soon showed design aptitude which launched his career as a digital game designer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for board game design, Sarnelle said, “I've been designing board games for fun in my spare time for ages. Back when I was working for <a href="https://www.twodots-game.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Two Dots</i></a>, I developed a number of board game prototypes that I would bring in to playtest with my co-workers, one of which was <i>Tend</i>.”</p>

<h2>Inspirations For The&nbsp;<em>Tend</em>&nbsp;Board Game</h2>

<p>I wanted to know from where the initial spark for <i>Tend</i> came. For Sarnelle, it all started around 2019 with the rise in popularity of Roll and Write games. “I had gotten really into Roll and Write games and played a bunch of stuff like <i>Cartographers</i> and <i>Welcome To</i>,” said Sarnelle. “I decided it seemed like a really fun type of game to design. I always find that designing with some constraints leads to interesting stuff.”</p>

<p>One of the most exciting constraints of <i>Tend</i> is the way you never get to store resources you gain from turn to turn. No matter what resource you gain, you’ve got to put it immediately to work, or score it for points. But what was it about farming games that excited Sarnelle? “Farming games have such a nice progression of upgrades and expansion,” he explained, “they would make for a really good progression system for a Roll and Write.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-scratch-off-components.jpg?itok=cD7hFu4W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-scratch-off-components.jpg?itok=N9r_slBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from my live playtest of the game, scratching off the squares when mining is so satisfying!</figcaption></figure><p>“Years later, by the time I started working on <i>Tend </i>fully, I had also played <i>Three Sisters</i> and <i>Hadrian's Wall</i>, both of which helped show me some cool stuff you could do in these types of games. I think after playing the <i>Stardew Valley</i> board game is when I really decided I wanted to fully finish the concept, it had some really cool stuff in it but for me didn't really scratch that itch I had from playing games like the&nbsp;<i>Stardew</i>&nbsp;video game and <i>Harvest Moon</i>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Echoing Sarnelle’s earlier statement that <i>Tend </i>is “crunchy,” the game includes plenty of interlocking mechanisms that lead to a seamless, satisfying play experience. But what’s it like creating and balancing a game like this? “It's an extensive process designing something as in-depth as <i>Tend</i>,” Sarnelle explains. “But the bigger challenge is actually trimming back the design to something manageable.”</p>

<p>“I love crunchy games with lots of moving parts, making sure that they don't end up too complex for people to wrap their heads around is my biggest challenge. For <i>Tend</i>, it really started with the core pieces of classic farming video games combined with this idea of a Flip and Write where the deck of cards you're playing with is being built over time.”</p>

Instead of rolling, these tick up each turn and will eventually yield goods</figcaption></figure><p>“I then usually throw as much junk in there as I can think of that could be fun, and then start playtesting to see which parts feel good and which parts aren't working.” Sarnelle explains that he’s a big proponent of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. “From there you just start cutting things that aren't working and adjusting like crazy.”</p>

<h2><em>Tend&nbsp;</em>Makes Its Debut</h2>

<p>So now that the game is on its way to the public, what has it been seeing everything become more real? “This experience has been incredible,” exclaims Sarnelle. “The team at IV Studios are an absolute blast to work with, they have contributed a ton of great stuff to the general design of <i>Tend</i> and are incredible at all facets of creating a board game.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“From a visual and creative standpoint I basically let them do whatever they thought would be best, as they have a great eye for art and component design, and they continuously impressed me. We worked together constantly to make sure we kept the game understandable and playable while also being gorgeous and letting the visuals work with the gameplay for the best possible experience.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-manifest.jpg?itok=C824lGm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-manifest.jpg?itok=qJzx8AWm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bingo-like markers make tracking and scoring your resources a snap! Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><p>“The excitement when that first prototype arrived at my house really cannot be overstated, it was an incredible moment.” One of the things that’s most exciting about the physical production of the game are the stamp markers you use to mark off the goods you store in cargo, and the scratch off cards used for forestry and mining. It’s these components that are some of the things Sarnelle’s most excited for gamers to get their hands on.</p>

<h2>The Joys And Worries Of Bringing A Game To Life</h2>

<p>With the launch of&nbsp;<i>Tend </i>happening now on Kickstarter, I wanted to know what’s going through Sarnelle’s head. What does it feel like to have a project he’s worked on for so long finally get out there? <b>“</b>I’m SUPER excited,” said Sarnelle. “Honestly, I was initially nervous a month or so ago. Any time you make anything there's always this feeling of dread of ‘what if people don't like it?’ Obviously I feel like the game is good (or I wouldn't be making it), but after playing it across hundreds of iterations over many years you get to the point where it can be hard to really judge how fun it is for a new player.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You get worried it will be hard to understand or that other people won't enjoy the things you like (this stuff is especially amplified when you're working on it solo for so long). When we started to get some first impressions back from content creators that were positive though, it really put that nervousness to rest. The only nervous energy left now is the sadness that I won't be working on it anymore soon once it's all out there and done!”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-upgrading-tools.jpg?itok=GgX0gtit 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-upgrading-tools.jpg?itok=kG-6Sa-W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrading your tools, from your fishing line to your pickaxe, are crucial to success in&nbsp;<em>Tend</em>. Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><h2>Advice For Aspiring Designers</h2>

<p>Finally, I wanted to know Sarnelle’s advice for people interested in designing their own games. “My biggest advice always for getting into any sort of game design,” said Sarnelle, “is to play and design a lot of games! When you are playing games try to keep in mind what you're enjoying from them and why (don't be afraid to take notes if it helps you).”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Board games are great because anyone can make them with basically no technical knowledge required and very few resources. If you have an idea, write it down and draw up some components and try it out! Don't be afraid if it's not all fun initially, just get something you can play and see if any of it <i>is</i> fun.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Don't be afraid to cut things that were core to your initial idea if they aren't working, focus on whatever feels fun and keep iterating. On a more technical level, once you find something you like I highly suggest organizing your game's data in spreadsheets and using a tool like component studio to make iteration quick and easy.”</p>

<p>Using Black Ops 6’s best Assault Rifles is a surefire way to rack up a high Elimination count, boost your KD, and finish as MVP. Thanks to statistics and hours of gameplay, we’ve put together a handy list showing you how each AR stacks up, as well as the best Assault Rifle loadout in BLOPS 6.</p>



<p>I like to use a rapid SMG at close quarters, or if I fancy the layout of the next map, I’ll switch to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping loadout</a> for quickfire, snappy sniping, and killfeeds. One constant for me is that no matter what happens, I’ll eventually end up with an Assault Rifle back in my war-torn mitts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a plethora of Assault Rifles at its disposal, and it’s time to weed out the best from the rest and put a bonafide carnage causer in your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-assault-rifle-ranked-in-black-ops-6-from-best-to-worst">Every Assault Rifle Ranked in Black Ops 6 from best to worst</h2>



<p>For a lot of these entries, I’m using the most recent stats from meta-specialist <a href="https://www.wzranked.com/bo6/meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wzranked</a>, and the personal experiences of the team to determine the best Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-xm4-best-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">1. XM4—Best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>XM4 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking the top spot is the very reliable and remarkably faultless <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. The Assault Rifle is a staple of first-person shooter gaming, has been seen the world over, and is currently dominating the Black Ops 6 landscape. It performs excellently across all AR criteria, it comfortably has the highest usage of any AR—its immediate availability being a big reason—and it continues to be a reliable killer while you unlock the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6’s weapons</a>. Until something changes, <strong>this is the best gun in BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ak-74">2. AK-74</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AK-74 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Honestly, I think the <strong>AK-74 is closer to the top spot than it seems</strong>. I love the brute-force nature of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a>, and it’s only the haphazard nature of its recoil holding it back from being the king of the jungle. If you reduce its vertical and horizontal recoil as best as you can, the AK-74 is a straight-shooting monster—and its firepower alone is enough to take second place. It’s unlikely Treyarch ever reduces its recoil for this reason, but you never know!</p>



<h2 id="h-3-as-val">3. AS Val</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AS Val Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hot take incoming: I think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS Val</a> should be classified as an SMG, not an Assault Rifle. As it stands, the AS Val is an Assault Rifle, and this makes it one of the best Assault Rifles in the game. Its default magazine leaves a lot to be desired, but there’s no doubting its DPS potential if you’re accurate with your shots. A better mag and a harness on its recoil easily make the AS Val one of the most diverse weapons in all of Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-gpr-91">4. GPR 91</h2>



<figure><figcaption>GPR 91 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I can’t put my finger on what it is, but when I used the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-gpr-91-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPR 91</a> in the Campaign, <strong>it slapped</strong>. Now, it’s not an AR I’m going to choose over anything I’ve ranked higher, but if you’re struggling for some inspiration, or feel your playstyle has become a bit uninspired and mundane, I’d recommend taking the GPR 91 out for a spin. It needs a firepower boost to stand a chance of cracking the top three, but it’s also not a bad choice either.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-ames-85">5. AMES 85</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ames 85 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ames 85</a> earns its place in our Assault Rifle ranking list. It’s snappy, I find it terrific at longer-range firefights, and it’s a solid AR all around. It’s one of those; I don’t think it’s remarkable in any category, and I feel I see it being used more in online multiplayer than it warrants. That being said, if you do prefer engaging at a distance, try out the Ames 85. Plus, if it does get buffed, you already have a headstart on its attachments.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-model-l">6. Model L</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Model L Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-model-l-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model L</a> performs similarly to the Ames 85 but doesn’t deliver quite as consistently, although it’s another AR better suited to long-range assaults. Again, it’s rare you find unusable weapons, and with the right attachments, anything is a deadly weapon. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say, and the Model L feels like it might click with a certain audience—just maybe not myself. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-goblin-mk2">7. Goblin Mk2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goblin Mk2 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eh, I don’t have much to say about the Goblin Mk2 really—nothing positive at least. It’s a semi-auto AR—putting it more in line with a Marksman Rifle than an AR—and even then there are better Marksman Rifles. <strong>The Goblin reeks of a gun stuck near the bottom of the meta</strong> for the longest time, until it receives a hefty buff, and suddenly becomes god-tier—à la the KSP 45 from Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>Here’s our official ranking of every Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6:</p>



<ol>
<li>XM4</li>



<li>AK-74</li>



<li>AS Val</li>



<li>GPR 91</li>



<li>Ames 85</li>



<li>Model L</li>



<li>Goblin Mk2</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-loadout-in-black-ops-6">What is the best Assault Rifle loadout in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The XM4 is our number one pick for the best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6—for now—but if you’re after the perfect loadout to use for it, we’ve got a great setup detailed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 5.56 Nato SMJ</li>



<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-fastest-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the fastest Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The <strong>AS Val</strong> has the best fire rate of any AR in Black Ops 6. Combined with its shorter mag by default, the AS Val rips through enemies, and I’d label it as more of an SMG than I would an Assault Rifle. Nevertheless, the AS Val shreds through ammo clips in seconds and is worth considering if you can get its furious fire rate under control.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-most-powerful-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the most powerful Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>No surprise here as the <strong>AK-74</strong> is the most naturally hard-hitting Assault Rifle in all of Black Ops 6. The AK series is notorious for being outrageously powerful and dropping opponents in fewer shots than most. The only downside is that it kicks like a mule with another mule strapped to it. Slapping the Gunfighter Wildcard on this bad boy might not even be enough to control it—nor would a leash. If your recoil control is better than most, the AK-74 has to be worth consideration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-devs-interview-machine-games-lucasfilm-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is billed as a love letter, but it's not quite what fans might expect from either the beloved action franchise or developer MachineGames — the studio behind hit games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>. Instead it's a methodical game in which Indy dons disguises, creeps around famous areas like the Pyramids of Giza, and solves ancient puzzles. It's less brawling on a tank heading for a cliff's edge, and more like the classic LucasArts adventure game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-fate-of-atlantis">Fate of Atlantis</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have [action setpieces], but there's so much more and that's why the character is so interesting. He's a professor, he's an archeologist, but he also know how to punch," MachineGames Creative Director Jens Andersson says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This unorthodox approach to Indiana Jones — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-in-first-person-just-makes-sense">not to mention the decision to put it in first-person</a> — has left plenty of fans feeling non-plussed. But Andersson and Lucasfilm Games Craig Derrick say that they're making an authentic Indiana Jones experience, even if they won't confirm one way or another whether it's canon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It needs to be a stand-alone story. And where we go from there, we'll see. It needs to be a self-contained story, like any of the movies," Andersson says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview conducted during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-final-preview">our hands-on preview of The Great Circle</a>, we quizzed Andersson and Derrick on how it's handling action, whether you can "choose poorly," the PS5 Pro, and numerous other topics, and you can find their answers below. As for Indiana Jones and the Great Circles, it's set to release on Xbox and PC on December 9, with a PS5 release date set for spring 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>As we get closer to release, what has MachineGames had to learn over the course of this experience in order to make Indiana Jones everything you want it to be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jens Andersson, Creative Director, MachineGames:</strong> Well, it's been a long development. We had to learn a lot, but I talked about this just now as well a little bit, where you bring everything you have from your previous project into the next project. So you have this base to build on going all the way back from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay">Chronicles of Riddick</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-darkness">The Darkness</a>... <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein</a>... but applying the same processes that we did those games to an Indiana Jones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means story first, focusing what's the story we want to tell. Focus on the characters. What do you want to do as Indiana Jones? Then build it from there. And then we pull in all the things we've learned over the years on what works and what doesn't, and what we like, what we don't like. And I think the things that we needed to learn, obviously we needed to deviate from the double shotgun kind of approach to a game where you have a whip and then you have a revolver and you have your brains. We need puzzles in there. How do we do those with our design sensibilities, with our player agency driven kind of mentality? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So how do we make it feel like you're playing Indiana Jones, that's all there is really. And then extrapolate from there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think when a lot of people think of Indiana Jones, they think of Indy running away from the boulder or fighting Nazis on the tank or various action set pieces.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> And we have those, but there's so much more and that's why the character is so interesting. He's a professor, he's an archeologist, but he also know how to punch. He infiltrates, he uses disguises. There's a wealth of interesting choices that this character makes that we want to bring to the player.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Well, we don't want to have insta-kill moments when you pick the wrong object necessarily, but... There is gnarly stuff in there as well</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think one of my favorite moments is from Last Crusade where it's like you have chosen wisely or you've chosen poorly. Are those kinds of choices in Great Circle? Can you insta-age into a corpse? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson: </strong>Well, we don't want to have insta-kill moments when you pick the wrong object necessarily, but... There is gnarly stuff in there as well. We are trying to make this as an authentic Indiana Jones story as we can. There's plenty of good story beats that fits into an Indiana Jones' story and universe, and we want to make that as much as possible. There's obviously some things that happen that works better in our game setup, being a first-person adventure game, like the boulder thing, you have something coming at your back. It's hard to do something like that in first-person, while puzzles are such a big part of the Indiana Jones character, even though we don't see too much in the movies. So we're try to do that really well instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Craig Derrick, Executive Producer, Lucasfilm Games: </strong>We don't really have jump scares necessarily, but we have the creepy crawlies sometimes... And there's a couple of moments when you'll see Indy in a precarious situation and you'll feel like it's claustrophobic. You'll feel like it's a little bit scary and still in the safest possible way, but I think we bring much of that, as you say, authenticity of the films into this game throughout it. It's an extraordinary experience to go through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There was a point where I was in the Vatican and I pulled out my revolver and I shot a bunch of Nazis. But you made it so you can't shoot the dog.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> Yeah, we made it so you can't shoot the dog directly... [Indiana Jones] is a dog person. So this is obviously a little bit different than Wolfenstein as well, where the dog will explode. But it's family-friendly IP in many ways. How do we do that well? Well, these are the kind of things that we do. We have dogs as enemies, but you don't really hurt the dogs. You scare them away.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones Movies, Games, and TV Shows in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm kind of relieved honestly because there's so many games where I'm like, "I don't want to do that. Don't make me hurt the dog."</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick: </strong>I saw you do it, too. I saw you get to that moment and I thought, "I wonder if she's going to try."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, it was going to eat me otherwise, so it was kind of a kill or be killed kind of moment. Talking about iD Tech briefly, I'm wondering what advantages iD Tech affords over something like say Unreal Engine?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson: </strong>So we've been working with iD Tech for a long, long while now. We've actually branched off, and applied our own special sauce to it. The big advantage with having your own engine is that you get to do whatever you want — you can tailor the engine towards what you are trying to do. At the same time, it's such a robust engine. That's why we're doing the PlayStation 5 version. It's by nature a multi-platform engine. So we get a little bit of what's good in both worlds. There are other engines out there that are really good, but I think we can compete with them visually toe-to-toe, is that the saying?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You brought up the PS5. </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">How's the move to PS5 been going</a><strong> and are there any plans to support the PS5 Pro with added features?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> I don't think we've said anything regarding the PS5 Pro, have we? No. So we are obviously working on it. It's coming out next spring, right? It's going well. Again, it's by its core, a multi-platform engine, so there are no huge restructuring or anything like that needed. So it's going well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's it been like to go from making your own franchise in Wolfenstein and that kind of thing to a licensed game where I'm sure that there are so many different check marks to go through, layers of approvals.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> So of all the games we worked on, Riddick, Darkness, even Wolfenstein, they weren't invented at MachineGames. They're built on another IP, even though it was kind of in-house IP. With Indiana Jones, obviously we get the pleasure of working with these guys Lucasfilm games and that's hard, but wonderful. You need to share. But they come in with this wealth of experience and expertise. They know what makes the characters tick. They know everything about the world. They can provide all the information that we need. So it's about finding that, "How do we make this an effective collaboration?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick: </strong>Yeah, I was just going to say, because Lucasfilm Games in collaboration with MachineGames, it very much starts off as, "What are we working on together? What's the experience of making an Indiana Jones game and how do we make that as easy as possible?" We want them to do what they do best, which is make these great games. And as you've spoken about a little bit of how do they take what that DNA is and apply it to an Indiana Jones experience that might not entirely be exactly what they've experienced previously and how do we do that together?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we spent a good amount of time talking through, "What does it mean to play as Indiana Jones? What does it feel to have sort of an intellectual wit to look at a scene or look at a sequence and think of it as how would you solve this sequence? Or how would you get through this without using a gun, without this sort of violence? How do you do that?" And then if there's an opportunity for the player to do that, what do those mechanisms do? And so much of that is just dialogue and conversation with this team. And it's been wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> There's a strong and mental trust that's needed and that we have that it wouldn't work without. And I think the way we make games at MachineGames as well makes it a little bit easier because we are such a story-first studio. So in the first couple of months of the product, we had the story already, and once you align on that, you have the bones of the game. It's easier to come to agreement with everything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> Well, you solve the tone and the texture of the world that way. When you're speaking about not just the character of Indiana Jones, but Henry Jones and the sort of globetrotting adventure part of that. When we're working through that, it's really what are those beats of that story? What are the important parts of the IP that we can cover? And they've nailed it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That's why we're doing the PlayStation 5 version. It's by nature a multi-platform engine. So we get a little bit of what's good in both worlds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>If you don't mind me saying, I think that Lucasfilm Games has a little bit of a reputation, at least among Star Wars developers, for being quite strict in its approach to the IP. Does it have a different approach to Indiana Jones and are there any lessons you've taken from your experiences working on Star Wars?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick: </strong>No, I don't know that... We're protective and I think it's important to ensure that the partners that we work with — whether it's Star Wars, whether it's Indiana Jones — understand how we see the world and the stories. And I think for this one, it's been just as straightforward as the others, at least in my experience. But I think it's all about authenticity. I know we use that a lot here, but we say, "If someone comes in, wants to tell a great Indiana Jones story and understands what that means for us, it's also us speaking to the audience. It's about speaking to the history of the IP. It's about making sure that we're doing the right thing for the audience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> There are a number of things that have made this easy and we are all big, big Indiana Jones fans. We want to make a game that feels like an Indiana Jones game. Once you have that, you've won half the battle already because we want the same thing. So the rest is figuring out the details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> There's no shortage of passion that we see across all our projects and this team and came right from the very beginning with that amazing story. And then just this again, said earlier, coming in and describing how they wanted to treat it makes everything else go through very, very smooth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So do you have the same approach to Indy as you do with Star Wars or are there different considerations at play?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> I don't think we do. I think it's all the same. We really want to treat the worlds of our stories at Lucasfilm and Lucasfilm Games the same. We do make more Star Wars games than we do Indiana Jones games, but from that point, it's always really the same method.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Todd Howard, I think is a producer on this project.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Derrick: Producer, yeah.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Known for being a huge Indy fan, spent a lot of time </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-indiana-jones-game-george-lucas-machinegames">pitching it to various sources</a><strong>, finally got to make the game. I know he's a very busy man. How involved is he in the day-to-day of this project?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> Well, for the majority of the project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">he obviously shipped Starfield</a>, so he had a day job, but he's been with us all the way through, providing feedback, providing advice, so I don't know what that means in terms of hours, but he's been involved... This game wouldn't exist without him obviously, so we're happy to have him butt in and give us his expertise on everything.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">17 Details From the Indiana Jones and The Great Circle Trailer</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So much of this game is an obvious real love letter to Indiana Jones, but does it take any swings that really push the mythos and the franchise forward? In what ways does this game look forward rather than into the past?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> I would say this is not a movie. This is a game and we're making something big, something new, something in my mind, very exciting. We're not seeing a new movie on the horizon, but we're seeing a game. So that's the primary thing that it brings. Other than that, just as you say, it's a love letter. We are telling a very authentic Indiana Jones story, so we want to be part of it, what it means long term. Who knows?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> What I like though is that it's sitting between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/raiders-of-the-lost-ark">Raiders of Lost Ark</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade">The Last Crusade</a>, and the story that you experience in this game enriches those films, as much as the films bring a lot of story back to this. You know where Indy goes from a story standpoint through this experience when you pick him back up in The Last Crusade. So there is a little bit of, it might not be moving the character forward in a different direction, but it is moving the character forward in a place that you've already seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>He's been in five movies and the Young Indiana Jones, he's a very well-known and established character. But is there a new side of Indiana Jones to explore in this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick: </strong>I think you see really is him being impulsive. And I think at a moment in this story, he's running away from problems. He's looking for that next adventure and he's not looking to settle down. And so I think there's a little bit of what you may already know about the character... And that might explain a little bit of who he is as a character in this time of his life. What is he running away from and what is he running to? And I think that shapes a little bit of his identity in this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> I don't think we're trying to change anything. We want to build on what's there and enrich on it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think at a moment in this story, he's running away from problems. He's looking for that next adventure and he's not looking to settle down</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Indy's been all over the world in all of his movies. Was there an area in The Great Circle that you were designing that you were like, "Oh, this is fun. We've never really seen Indiana Jones in this particular context before."</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson: </strong>We evaluated plenty of areas. The ones we ended up with are the ones that we felt were good for the story and were good for gameplay. We wanted to have these kind of varied biomes from the jungles of Sukhothai to the deserts of Giza. I've also seen some snowy parts of the game. It's what you said, it's part of the Indiana Jones to visit all these kind of different places. And that works really great for a video game as well. We want to have that. So yeah, all of these are our choices where we want the game to take place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there going to be a point where the world opens up and you can jump to different areas?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> Well, in a way it's obviously a linear, very driven story that takes you around the world. We are doing this game a little bit different than previous games that we worked on where we're allowed to go back to previous locations and continue playing from there. It's almost like a time jump back. So you will be able to 100 percent the game on a single save lot. And the reason why we're doing it like that is that we have these really wide, big areas like Giza, and then we have stretches of more linear rollercoaster rides, and there's a lot of optional content in there... a lot of hidden mysteries and things like that. So we want players who focus on the story to be able to play through it, and if they really love an area,  they can go back and just finish up everything without having to replay the more linear sections. It doesn't fit into the narrative story, but from a gameplay perspective, you can do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is this game canon?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> It's authentic to Indiana Jones. It's authentic to the stories that we've told. And again, to the point of between the two movies and how the story really connects those two movies. So it's an authentically told story that I think fits really well in everything else you've experienced with Indiana Jones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is this a standalone story or a jumping-off point with the franchise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson: </strong>It needs to be a stand-alone story. And where we go from there, we'll see. It needs to be a self-contained story, like any of the movies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I was asking earlier about choices. Will there be meaningful choices that you can make that impact the end of the story? Or is it more of a linear story in that regard?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson: </strong>It's more of a linear story to be honest. It's a really well-told, well-acted by our amazing cast with a proper conclusion. And then you can keep going and discover everything that the world has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I was looking at the difficulty settings and I saw light, moderate, hard, very hard. Was there any discussion of a hardcore mode or anything even higher?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> So many discussions. Very hard is actually a very recent addition. I really like that we have separate action difficulty and adventure difficulty. I just think it's fun with action and adventure. But more to the point, we want to make this game accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. And some people do enjoy the challenge of combat and some people enjoy the puzzles more. It is hard to have a single version of that. The action difficulty is a wider range because it makes more sense to give more options there. For the adventure part, we actually designed to versions of many puzzles and we didn't want to have that work be exponentially harder. So it kind of works. Either you like puzzles or you don't. For action, it's about how twitchy it is, what feats can you pull off with the controller,</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>There was a talk about a separate story expansion called Order of the Giants. Can you give me any more details about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> No really, not. It's coming out Spring 2025. It's a story-based DLC. That's what I can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/report-disney-lost-over-100-192008233.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dial of Destiny reportedly lost $100 million for Disney</a><strong>, and I think a lot of people came away from that going, "Is Indy done?" And so I guess sort of bluntly I have to ask: Is Indiana Jones still relevant in 2024?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Derrick:</strong> I think Indiana Jones is still relevant in 2024. I think the characters feels really contemporary and yet also authentic to the franchise. I think what we talked about here is you have a great performer in Troy Baker who feels like he's embodying Indiana Jones. We have a great new story at the heart of this game that players who are familiar with Indiana Jones and the stories of Indiana Jones, I think, will really feel there's callbacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And again, we use the idea that this feels authentic. It feels real. It feels like it's a part of every experience you've had with Indiana Jones. And then for those players that are less familiar or coming in new to this, it's going be an introduction to the character. And I think the mix of gameplay, the way that the story plays, the focus on adventure and exploration and puzzle solving... I think there's a way to introduce the character. And I think then to me, that makes it relevant. It makes it a really fun experience for people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Andersson:</strong> We wouldn't be making it if we didn't think it was relevant. That's the easy answer really. This game is a love letter to everything. There's so much stuff in there that's fan service almost, just a wealth of stuff that people who've seen in the movies can enjoy. But this game is coming to Game Pass. A lot of people are going to boot this up having never having seen an Indiana Jones movie, and it needs to work for them too. And so we made sure that you don't need to know who this character is to enjoy this video game. How well they relate to it. We'll see soon, right? I'm optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

I never really saw more than 1 or 2 steps ahead of me, it was very improvisational and based on what I thought would feel good as I playtested.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there is some logic that can be found, I think the kind of steps I took could be categorized in four ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Searching for Inspiration</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Player Physics</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Camera Motion</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VFX and SFX</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So I’d bounce between each of those in a loop for about 3 years, and the end result is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Echo Point Nova</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Searching for inspiration">Searching for inspiration</h2><p>Image via Greylock Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Echo Point Nova</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wears its inspirations on its sleeve so I have no shame in sharing the games that inspired the mechanics. Often when I was stuck in getting a mechanic that didn't feel right, I’d play games to see how other devs solved it, or sometimes I would just be playing a game for fun and realize I really like how the devs solved something I had been puzzling over.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hoverboard was born out of the sprint to crouch slide mechanic as seen in most modern shooters, in particular Call of Duty. I had built a similar mechanic into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Echo Point Nova</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because it felt cool, and was really enjoying it as a way to traverse down slopes. I realized it would be nice if I could traverse this way even up slopes and got to thinking what would justify that. Well, what can slide wherever, whenever, for as long as you want? A hoverboard! Thus the board was born.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m not sure where the idea for grapple came from, I think it’s just a cool thing to have in games. A grapple was a major request for my last game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Severed Steel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but I could never figure out a way to add it without totally breaking the balance of the game, so starting a new game was an opportunity to implement a grapple.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the biggest influence on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Echo Point Nova</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s grapple was from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Halo Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I thought the way they handled steering it (just look in the direction you want to go) was great. I also liked the different ways they automatically ended a grapple to stop the player from getting stuck grappling when they don’t want to be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text"><br>Player physics</h2><p>Image via Greylock Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hoverboarding is based on Unreal’s walking physics with friction and deceleration disabled. Also, typically a player hits their max walk speed quickly, but a hoverboard takes a few seconds of holding forward to hit top speed giving it a feeling of accelerating a vehicle. Probably the trickiest part was in getting the board to recognize and launch off slopes; by default the Unreal character motion really wants to stick to slopes so I had to write some slope detection code to figure out when the player should catch some air. Unreal also makes a lot of assumptions about how you want to handle Z velocity when falling off ledges or multi jumping, and thankfully I was able to override many to make things feel how I wanted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The grapple runs on a tick checking that determines if the player is looking at anything they can grapple on; it also remembers if the player recently looked at something grapple-able and will let them grapple to it even if they aren't quite still looking at it. This keeps things flowy and lets the player be a little imprecise with the grapples while traveling at high speed. When the player grapples their velocity interpolates between their current velocity and the desired grapple velocity over about a second. Their desired grapple velocity is essentially where they are looking. If the player’s velocity is not in the direction of their grapple, or if they are close enough to their grapple point, or if they are looking away from their grapple, the grapple breaks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text"><br>Camera motion</h2><p>Image via Greylock Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve found that camera motion is important to getting the feel of these motions right (along with options to turn off any camera flourish, for players who don’t enjoy it).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For both grapple and hoverboard, FOV distortion I think really helps sell the sense of speed. The faster the player is moving, the wider their FOV is. I think someone who worked with me on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Severed Steel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggested this idea and I quite like it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For hoverboarding I do a couple things with the camera to sell the feeling of being on a board. I gently bob the camera up and down while in surf mode, to give the feeling of being on a floating object. When the player strafes on the board I tilt the camera like one might tilt their body to guide a snowboard, and I also tilt the camera to match the right or left slope when surfing perpendicular to a slope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A very important part of moving it is smoothing the movement when the character snaps between points. The way unreal handles stairs is to essentially teleport the character between each step which results in jarring camera teleporting by default. So, I’m always smoothing the camera so jumps like that aren't disruptive.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VFX and SFX">VFX and SFX</h2><p>Image via Greylock Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These might not need explanation but I think they have to be mentioned for this article to be complete. The hoverboard has a pulsing electric engine sound effect which I pitch up based on the player's velocity. It also has particle FX attached to the board that kick up debris, the type of debris changes depending on the surface the player is on and the speed of the debris changes depending on player velocity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the grapple I thought it was important to have a snappy sound to confirm a successful grapple, along with a bright obvious beam to show what you grappled to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final takeaway">Final takeaway</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’d like to highlight how any given game mechanic can’t really be viewed in isolation. So, for player physics, I can’t even imagine what it would have felt like in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Echo Point Nova </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">without camera effects, sound FX, and VFX. We can expand that further and say that all this work on getting the feel of movement tuned wouldn't matter if the levels weren't interesting, and we can zoom out even further and say the movement system wouldn’t matter if it was unlocked in a weird part of the game or wasn’t tutorialized well. While we are zooming out, let's zoom out more to my workflow. I lead a small indie dev team where I’m the only programmer with engine access, so ultimately I can change what I want when I want. This allowed me to iterate as much as I wanted in whatever order I wanted to, which enabled my workflow where I could bounce between player physics, sound FX, VFX, and whatever else I wanted. I’m not sure how replicable such a flow would be for a larger team or a team with less centralization of decision making, but if such a method is compatible with your team then maybe give it a try.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope you enjoyed reading this!

		<p>Nintendo has announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for Nintendo Switch, coming out on 30th March 2025 for the game’s 10th anniversary, and removing one more reason to keep you Wii U plugged in… or maybe even to keep it at all!</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Coming March 20th, 2025 (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKHz71V7Csc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition promises to enhance the sci-fi RPG epic on its way to the Switch, with the original game pushing the Wii U to the limits and making certain sacrifices to stick to 30FPS – though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaYfIdZ-_a0">it did manage to hold this target a lot</a>.</p>


<p>The Definitive Edition does also promise some new story elements. It’s not clear what this will be, and could be integrated into the main story alongside other side-missions and quests, or a separate addendum, similar to what we’ve seen with the most recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to other entries in the series, there’s a pretty big tonal shift for Xenoblade Chronicles X, with more of a sci-fi feel, some clashing art styles, and more. The game takes us to the year 2054 with Earth destroyed in the crossfire of an alien war, and just a small number of survivors surviving to make it to the planet Mira. It’s up to you to explore this land as part of BLADE, help found New Los Angeles, and take on online missions and grand multiplayer Global Nemesis Battles for up to 31 players – the online is returning for this Nintendo Switch remaster.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is one of the last major Nintendo Wii U games that will be ported to Nintendo Switch – and quite possibly doing so right around the launch of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/"> the anticipated Switch successor</a>. Pretty much everything else, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/09/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review/">Mario</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">platformers</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review/">Donkey Kong</a>, and even other niche JRPGs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/15/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore</a> have been ported across. At this point, it’s really just the run-of-the-mill sports and Mario RPGs, and games that can only work with the Wii U Gamepad’s second screen that are trapped on the system – your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/04/22/affordable-space-adventures-review/">Affordable Space Adventures</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review/">Star Fox Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review/">Star Fox Guard</a>, Nintendo Land are the last few standouts (for better or worse)</p>
<p>Looking back at the original release and our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X review</a>, Dom said, “Xenoblade Chronicles X is a genuinely enthralling game. It doesn’t take it easy on you though, and the perseverance and attention required may override the spectacle and beauty found here. Fans of the last game may also struggle with the tonal and technical shift, but if you want to experience one of the most involving, creative and expansive open worlds ever created, Xenoblade Chronicles X is essential.”</p>
