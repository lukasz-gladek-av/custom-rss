            <p>Former RPS sealife correspondent Nate once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maneater-review">described the game Maneater</a> as "an ecstatically violent simulation of being a fool's idea of a shark", which stuck with me. The Jaws Effect is a reasonably well known phenomenon <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275954344_The_Jaws_Effect_How_movie_narratives_are_used_to_influence_policy_responses_to_shark_bites_in_Western_Australia">coined in a paper</a> that explores the impact the 1975 film had on Australian policy response to shark bites, although the term is now used a bit more broadly to refer to how sharks are villainised in pop culture - villainisation obviously being an absurdly human and dramatic concept to apply to a hungry or scared fish.</p>
<p>Jaws <a href="https://jeevoka.com/jaws-is-responsible-for-killing-a-colossal-amount-of-sharks/s">did actually result in an increase in shark culls</a>, but its lasting legacy has also been argued to be more insididous. Depending on whether you're looking at stats from the UN or from conservation charities, the number of sharks killed or mutilated and harvested each year for fins and other parts ranges between about 10 and 100 million, and it's been <a href="https://sharkstewards.org/how-jaws-influenced-shark-perception/">argued this continues</a> with relatively little pushback as compared to similar wildlife atrocities due to wide-reaching perception that ranges from apathy to vilification. A sharknado of lies, if you will.</p>

<p>It's a sort of reverse Finding Nemo effect - not the discredited idea that everyone rushed out and bought clownfish after seeing it, but the one that worker Sarah Wynn Williams writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People">in her book on Meta</a>, where a UN colleague in conversation tells her the Pixar films were the "single most impactful thing to actually protect the oceans over the last decade‚Äù. This is obviously a bit proverbial but the basic point that fictional media does stuff wot is also sometimes real should pretty much be a given by this point anyway.</p>
<p>All of which is the sort of shit that goes rushing through my head before I can get around to writing "lol look at the funny shark game". Even though, sure, the shark game <em>does</em> look funny. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shark-dentist">Shark Dentist</a> is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_Dentist">Crocodile Dentist </a>but with ray tracing and convincingly grimy teeth barnacles, set in an office that looks like the room from the first Saw film. The idea is you go poking around in a sedated shark's gumline and then act all shocked when it chomps your ears off.</p>
<p>Shark, quite famously, do not need the dentist because they're diligent flossers, and also because they replace their teeth frequently. This is fine. If this shark dentist was real they would be too stupid to live anyway, because they don't seem to have considered it might be prudent to bind the shark's jaws before getting in there with a buzzsaw. Here are some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3423280/Shark_Dentist">Steam</a> features:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Intense Gameplay:</strong> Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Roguelike Mechanics:</strong> Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</p>
<p><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Tool Interaction:</strong> Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Organic Balance:</strong> Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's for "lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw", which reminds me I never asked Nate about his feelings on The Meg combining two of his great loves - sealife and Jason Statham. I'll report back. Shark Dentist's release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shark-dentist-is-about-operating-on-a-fools-idea-of-a-shark]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's time to get totally radical, dudefolks. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the latest nostalgia-fest about avian athletes artfully acing acrobatic boardiness, drops in full today, July 11th. Though, thanks to pre-order early access meaning the game sort of released three days ago, its modding community is already off and running.</p>
<p>If you've spent the past few months watching old X Games reruns and thinking to yourself that all the shreddage might be better if Bob Burnqvist were an Edwardian nanny, a train chaser, or a gabagool enthusiast, I've got some good news.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking a glance at what THPS 3+4's Nexus Mods page has to offer as of this fine Friday, the answer is an awful lot of character skins swaps from modder Huckleberrypie, who's got a long and illustrious history of sticking different models into games. Here's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/barbieandthe12dancingprincesses/mods/3">Terry Honk</a> as the main character of Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses, a video game I had no idea existed until this morning.</p>
<p>They've clearly been working hard throughout these few early access days. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/11">Tommy Angelo</a> from the Mafia games, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/10">Tony Soprano</a> from the mafia game that was also a TV show, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/5">Snow White</a> from the Dwarven mafia, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/4">Elsa</a> from Frozen, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/3">the obligatory CJ</a> from GTA San Andreas - they're all here, swapped in for the Birdman and Brazilian prodigy Rayssa Leal while modders work out how to pull off standalone character additions.</p>
<p>For some reason, though, I can't take my eyes off one particular Huckleberrypie creation. It's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/12">Mary Poppins</a> from the 2018 film Mary Poppins Returns, which I haven't seen, but assume involves Mary Poppins coming back to force everyone to remember how to spell supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.</p>

<p>Along with the above video of Mary shredding the supercalifuck out of a park run, the modder's penned a backstory to explain her journey to skating superstardom. "Years after the events of the first film, Mary Poppins comes to the Bankses' aid when Michael's wife passed away and his family fell in dire straits due to the depression," it reads, "Mary clearly needed a break from all the turmoil her charges went through, and so she turned to her hobby of performing rock music and tearing up the park with her trusty skateboard."
</p>
<p>I don't care if it's the exact same narrative Huckleberrypie weaved for one of their multiple <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater1and2/mods/102">THPS 1+2 Mary Popins mods</a>, it's moving stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, the other mods on offer for 3+4 on release include a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/1">port of a 1+2 mod</a> that adds the likes of custom restarts and a free roam cam. Plus, there's the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/2">quick startup</a> for folks who can't stand three seconds of logo splashes. Oh, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/tonyhawksproskater34/mods/7">Master Chief</a> skating on a mini-tank.</p>
<p>Do you think Mary would have hit the 900 before Tony Hawk in real life, if she weren't a fictional character? I do, and if you disagree, you're just wrong.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-drops-in-full-today-so-of-course-a-modder-already-has-mary-poppins-poppin-kickflips]]></content:encoded>

Each one is based on a real racehorse, with the personalities, designs and stats of each character reflecting their IRL counterparts. With the 2021 free-to-play mobile game finally getting its English-language debut this June on Steam, more international fans have been discovering the charms of Umamusume‚Äôs characters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/image007-1752223496532.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has enjoyed a successful launch in the west via Steam.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pink-haired Haru Urara seems to have struck a particular chord with some players. To say she has a bubbly, positive, can-do attitude would be an understatement. Even though she often loses races, she is good friends with the other horse-girls and often buys them souvenirs. Like Umamusume‚Äôs other characters, plucky Haru Urara is based on the real life horse of the same name, who is now 29-years-old and enjoying her retirement at <a href="https://www.matha-farm.com/%E9%A6%AC%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%B9%E4%BB%8B/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matha Farm</u></a> in Japan‚Äôs Chiba Prefecture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone loves an underdog, or an underhorse in this case. Haru Urara raced from 1998 to 2004, however she didn‚Äôt win a single one of her 113 races. Although she made it to second and third place a handful of times, she spent most of her career literally lagging behind (source: <a href="https://www.jbis.jp/horse/0000307965/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>JBIS Search</u></a>). So much so that she became famous for losing, becoming a kind of national symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/gettyimages-154598960-1752223029427.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yutaka Take riding Haru Urara in 2004.

Even the betting slips with her name on were being used as charms to ward against traffic accidents (the word ‚Äú<em>ataranai</em>‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt win‚Äù stamped on losing betting slips is a homonym for not being hit, by a car for example). In 2018, Haru Urara became a local celebrity again when she was featured on Chiba police‚Äôs traffic safety posters, getting paid 600kg worth of carrots (source: <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20180822-RPWWJE7OAVJCFL6YLXXVVS6TIQ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Sankei News</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to July 2025, and users posting real life Haru Urara content on X noticed a sudden uptick of likes and follows, likely the Umamusume effect in action. X user animal_love_kaz, a self-confessed fan of retired racehorses who frequently posts photos and updates noted that their Haru Urara birthday post suddenly got thousands more likes overnight, with their overseas account gaining 400 new followers.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-leaked-document-allegedly-shows-why-krafton-delayed-the-game.1241244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The delay of Subnautica 2 has sparked into somewhat of a controversy between developer Unknown Worlds and parent company KRAFTON. Let's take a minute to recap what happened, chronologically:</p>



<ul>
<li>The game was originally meant to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-is-getting-a-new-game-by-june-2025-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by June 2025</a>, but that clearly didn't happen</li>



<li>Earlier this month, KRAFTON <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced</a> the Unknown Worlds studio leadership (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) with industry veteran Steve Papoutsis</li>



<li>This week, Bloomberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that KRAFTON had delayed Subnautica 2 to 2026. They also added that this would cause Unknown Worlds to lose a $250 million bonus linked to reaching a certain amount of revenue by the end of the year.</li>



<li>The delay was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>. However, KRAFTON claimed that it was not at all influenced by financial or contractual considerations.</li>



<li>Shortly afterward, the Korean publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked</a> the former leadership directly, stating that they had abandoned their responsibilities and caused the game to slip. For example, they said Charlie Cleveland focused on a personal film project of his instead of working on the game. </li>



<li>The studio leads would have allegedly received 90% of that $250 million bonus.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, some Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an internal KRAFTON document that shows exactly why the publisher didn't want the game to launch. In the current state, Subnautica 2 lacked the 'level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion.' The document also adds that content was removed from the original plan for the early access launch, such as two biomes, one type of Leviathan, certain creatures, several tools, about six hours of narrative content, and even the character customization feature. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>Basically, KRAFTON highlighted that the current version of Subnautica 2 wouldn't make users happy, thus the need for the delay to add more content and polish before making the game available to the public.</p>



<p>The former Unknown Worlds executives aren't taking those accusations lying down, though. A few hours ago, Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Reddit community</a> that he and the other execs are filing a lawsuit against KRAFTON:</p>



<p><em>We‚Äôve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public - you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life‚Äôs work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>



<p>Cleveland also denied that the $250 million bonus would have gone almost entirely to them. He said that they had always shared profits with the team and this would not have been different. </p>



<p>Needless to say, KRAFTON is likely to respond in kind to the lawsuit. We'll keep you apprised of any further updates.</p>

            <p>Tides Of Torment, the next DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, has been pushed back from its original Summer release window to later in the year, with September onwards sounding the likeliest from a<a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/75"> new blog post</a>.</p>
<p>And that's‚Ä¶honestly where the bad news ends, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the blog is filled with some exciting and pretty respectable thoughts about future updates. Even the reason for Tides Of Torment's delay ("the short answer was no", it didn't hit the team's standards) strikes me as a good sign, since it means the DLC team at least feel they've got the breathing room to not rush out something they're not happy with. It's too nice outside for my PC to be running the kind of temps 1000 angry sea elves are going to result in, anyway.</p>
<p>Ah, yes: Sea Elves are confirmed now, led by Sea Lord Aislinn. Expect more details from a new video in August, by the sound of it.</p>

<p>There's siege improvements coming to the Proving Ground beta branch later this month.

We‚Äôve seen a few folk asking for specific characters that might not fit in any of our current DLC formats, so we are exploring how we might introduce a smaller style of DLC that brings a single LL, or Hero Unit alongside a few favoured additions. We‚Äôre working out how these would fit with our schedules, but we have a good idea for who the first one could be, and she‚Äôs someone near and dear to your blood."</p></blockquote>
<p>That last bit is very likely a hint toward Vampire lord Neferata, but I'm more interested in what this might mean for future expansions. The blog later drops hints for a teaser for an announcement of a promise at CA's 25th anniversary bash in December for "one of the biggest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> content packs ever created in the trilogy", which might have a few of you huffing the Clan Skurvy grog fumes if you've kept up with things. </p>
<p>One of the more credible lines of speculation I've seen is that this is some sort of End Times pack, marking the winding down of the trilogy in favour of Total Warty Thousand, itself expected to be announced as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">multiple new Total War games CA have hinted at</a>. But single lord or other smaller DLCs sound like a great way to extend the life of Warhammer 3 without requiring the resources of the bigger expansions. Also, Rich Aldridge said he likes Halfling Soup Tanks in a video once. Just saying. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy producer, director, and designer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Anime News Network</a> at last week's Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, California. One of the first questions was about the viability of turn-based combat for future installments in the series. It was Yoshida himself who infamously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that, as the visuals get more realistic, it is increasingly challenging for some gamers to stomach turn-based combat without feeling a dissonance. That's one of the reasons Final Fantasy XVI went with action combat only, angering some fans in the process.</p>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which does feature turn-based combat (albeit spiced up with real time elements), did Yoshida change his mind? Not quite, based on his answer, though he did not exclude the possibility that the next Final Fantasy might have turn-based combat.</p>



<p><em>With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system. That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based. I'm not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida was chosen as the producer of Final Fantasy XVI after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-naoki-yoshida-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his excellent work as director of Final Fantasy XIV</a>. What did he learn during the development of the single player game?</p>



<p><em>There's a lot, but if I were to pick one, we were able to learn how to produce a high-end video game. There were a lot of learning points through that, and I feel like we gleaned a lot of know-how through the process. I want to challenge myself or apply to future works on how we can swiftly produce something of high quality and minimize the development period without lowering the quality.</em></p>



<p>Yoshida then said that he and his Final Fantasy XIV already have plans up to version 10.0 (the game is currently at version 7.0 with the Dawntrail expansion). Lastly, he expressed the desire to make a new online game based on a brand-new intellectual property at some point, and he added he doesn't feel anywhere near his retirement (he's currently 52).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/krafton-replaces-subnautica-2-studio-co-founders-effective-immediately/">Krafton‚Äôs firing of Unknown Worlds founders and execs</a> last week and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/subnautica-2-delayed-to-2026-just-a-week-after-krafton-fired-studio-co-founders/">the delay of Subnautica 2</a> has already been pretty wild and messy, but the publisher has now rolled up its sleeves and stepped down into the mud wrestling pits to try and restore its reputation and honour in this situation. In response, studio founder Charlie Cleveland has announced a lawsuit against Krafton.</p>
<p>In a statement posted as a pop-up on the Krafton website ‚Äì in and of itself a pretty wild way to deliver such a message ‚Äì Krafton accuses studio founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire of effectively abandoning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2‚Äôs</a> development to focus on other projects ‚Äì including <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">an independent movie by Cleveland with a podcast and‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ AI-generated movie posters</a> ‚Äì despite repeated requests by Krafton for them to return to work. With the game originally expected to reach Early Access in early 2024, it‚Äôs already significantly delayed, and Krafton claim that it is significantly lacking in content for even this stage.</p>


<p>Additionally, Krafton states that 90% of the $250 million payout would have been reserved for studio executives Cleveland, McGuire and former CEO Ted Gill. Importantly, Krafton now state that for the rest of the Unknown Worlds team, they ‚Äúreaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltmkisws4c2w">Per Bloomberg‚Äôs Jason Schreier</a>, the purchase agreement would mean there‚Äôs $25 million to be divided between roughly 40 employees from a team of 100. It‚Äôs also still tied to revenue targets.</p>
<p>Making such strong accusations is very significant, because it opens Krafton up to libel and defamation lawsuits. Given the strong community pushback at the publisher, it‚Äôs clear they felt they had no choice but to air some dirty laundry.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">Charlie Cleveland‚Äôs rebuttal</a> states that they ‚Äúknow in our souls that the game is ready for Early Access‚Äù, echoing his statement from last week, and denies that they would have taken 90% of the $250 million bonus for themselves, stating that ‚ÄúHistorically we‚Äôve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we‚Äôll continue with the earnout/bonus as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>Most significantly, he announces that they are suing Krafton: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public ‚Äì you all deserve the full story.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs all an abject mess, and will leave gamers unsure of who to believe. The Subnautica subreddit, for example, seems to still be wholly backing the studio founders, while there‚Äôs more doubt in more general gaming subreddits, especially with Cleveland‚Äôs movie projects coming to light.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember is the the vast majority of the work and the employees are unchanged by this ugly spat. For their sake, maybe it‚Äôs best to take a step back and wait for more information to surface before making a conclusion. Sure, remove a wishlisting for the game if you want, but also be open to this project still being good and developed by those with the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Here is Krafton‚Äôs full statement:</p>
<p><em>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</em></p>
<h3><em><strong>Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment‚ÄìDespite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</strong></em></h3>
<p><em>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Background of Leadership Change&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica‚Äôs unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica‚Äôs future success. We collaborated closely with the studio‚Äôs leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</em></p>
<p><em>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</em></p>
<p><em>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</em></p>
<p><em>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership‚Äôs conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>KRAFTON‚Äôs Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>KRAFTON‚Äôs Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2‚Äôs development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica‚Äôs ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</em></p>
<p><em>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</strong></em></p>
<p>And Charlie Cleveland‚Äôs rebuttal</p>
<p><em>Hello everyone,</em></p>
<p><em>It continues to be an explosive and surreal time for the Subnautica team and community. None of this is what we wanted. But we truly appreciate the amazing support we‚Äôve gotten from everyone. It means a lot to us, especially now.</em></p>
<p><em>As I wrote last week, we know in our souls that the game is ready for Early Access ‚Äì that‚Äôs just how we roll. And we‚Äôd like nothing more than for you to play it (game devs <strong>live</strong> for this). But it‚Äôs not currently under our control.</em></p>
<p><em>We‚Äôve now filed a lawsuit against Krafton: the details should eventually become (at least mostly) public ‚Äì you all deserve the full story. Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list. But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life‚Äôs work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue. I‚Äôm in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we‚Äôve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we‚Äôll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Stay tuned.</em></p>
<p><em>-Charlie</em></p>

<p>It's also on the way to the Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/azure-striker-gunvolt-trilogy-enhanced-announced-for-switch">Azure Gunvolt Trilogy Enhanced</a></strong> getting confirmed for a worldwide release yesterday, Inti Creates has now lifted the lid on its 30th anniversary project <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/majogami">Majogami</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It will be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong> and is described as a new paper craft "2D action experience". You can see the official premiere in the video above, and below this is some PR to go with it.</p>
<p>The game stars a young woman named Shiroha who must cut through the horrors of a bizarre world after her father is turned into paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paper craft character action. Majogami stars Shiroha, a young woman who has lost her memory, who travels alongside Shiori, her father who has been turned to paper. With her katana, "Kamikiri", in hand, she travels through a bizarre world and cuts through the horrors she finds there in this 2D character action platformer.</p>
<p>Players take control of Shiroha who can move and attack instantly with her "Setsuna" ability, taking out enemies without missing a beat.</p>
<p>Along her journey, Shiroha will collect cards imbued with her memories called Recarte, and face off against the diverse Majogami, divine "Craft Witches" who control the world. These Majogami, with twisted hearts and powerful magic, stand in Shiroha's way as she tries to escape their domain. In addition to her Setsuna attack, she can rely on Shiori's defense sigils and the power of the guardians she meets, the Astrals, to transform herself into new fighting forms.<br>
By defeating these Majogami, Shiroha can slowly regain her memories of both her and Shiori's life, deepening their bonds and revealing her story.</p>
<p>Experience the touching family story and see Shiroha's determination to make it through this twisted world to the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title will be available digitally on the Switch 2 for <strong>$39.99 USD</strong> (or the regional equivalent), or you can grab it on the Switch for <strong>$34.99</strong>. A physical release has also been confirmed for Japan. Here's a look at the box art design:</p>

<p>The multiplayer component wasn't in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/company_of_heroes_collection">Company of Heroes Collection</a> when it arrived on the Switch in 2023, but it's now here.</p>
<p>After promising to add this in as a post-launch update, Feral Interactive has now patched in online "cross-platform multiplayer" in the latest game update. This will allow you to fight online in "up to four player online skirmishes". Here's the <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1943249112641548782">announcement in full via social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Atten-shun! Online, cross-platform multiplayer has arrived for the Company of Heroes Collection on Nintendo Switch! Update today and take the fight online in up to four player online skirmishes. Battle your buddies across the world be they on Switch or mobile!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When Company of Heroes Collection originally launched on Switch, we mentioned how "incomplete" the game felt without multiplayer, so it's great to see the team has finally delivered it.</p>
<p>Feral Interactive also recently confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> is now playable on Switch 2 thanks to a recent system firmware update.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:155975,184230 @ 1752228206 -->
<p>Will you be returning to the Company of Heroes Collection to check out multiplayer on Switch? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-is-not-a-%E2%80%98stop-killing-games%E2%80%99-explainer-i-just-think-it%E2%80%99s-interesting.1241133/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you don't know--and people not knowing is going to be part of this!--for the past year or so <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a petition has been floating around asking the European Union to step in and consider forcing video game publishers and studios to 'Stop Killing Games'</a>.</p><p>While some of the language involved has been questionable--the words "consumer movement"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> are a huge red flag when it comes to video games</a>, and the subject line is pretty dramatic--what's actually being asked is fairly reasonable! The petition,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/26/iphone-usb-c-lightning-connectors-apple-eu-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> which is seeking to have the EU consider roughly the same common sense enforcement that led Apple to adopt USB-C</a>, ultimately wants every multiplayer game to ship with the ability for fans to take over running its servers if a company decides to cease official support.</p><p>A good idea, and one that we can all get behind. Which a lot of folks already have; despite slowing through 2024 the petition recently passed the threshold for consideration by the EU, bringing it back into the news cycle. But for the past couple weeks, almost every time I've seen this petition mentioned, and especially on places like social media, it's been through the weirdest lenses. It feels like it's been almost impossible for anyone to simply cover this normally, because from the get-go it's been linked with <em>YouTuber drama</em>, something I would usually rather gnaw my own arm off before engaging with.</p><p>For example: I landed on the front page of Reddit yesterday and was greeted very close to the top by this:</p><p>Believe it or not, that's about 'Stop Killing Games'. You wouldn't know it unless you were on top of YouTuber drama though, because 'Pirate Software' spoke out against the petition,<a href="https://www.si.com/esports/news/pirate-software-leaves-off-brand-games-as-stop-killing-games-reaches-goal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and was then rounded upon by other channels, and then other people tried to lay blame for the campaign stalling through 2024, and I simply cannot bring myself to type any more about this</a>. Instead, I'm going to let my former colleague Ethan Gach <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-accursed-farms-piratesoftware-eu-1851785707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summarise</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The resurgence began with a new video from Accursed Farms two weeks ago titled, ‚ÄúThe end of Stop Killing Games.‚Äù In it, Scott laid out why he thought the initiative has run out of steam and was failing, laying no small part of the blame at the feet of fellow YouTuber Jason ‚ÄúThor‚Äù Hall, a former Blizzard developer more commonly known by his indie studio pseudonym Pirate Software. Scott accused Hall of leveraging the latter‚Äôs big viewership to misinterpret and spread falsehoods about the ‚ÄúStop Killing Games‚Äù initiative, in part by casting it as na√Øve and unworkable in the modern gaming landscape where always-online and server-centric releases are flopping all the time.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Exhausting. I did see some straight-faced news stories about the petition's success, but almost every time that news was<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-tops-12m-signatories-prompting-response-from-video-games-europe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> accompanied</a> by a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-has-hit-a-major-milestone-but-the-fights-just-begun-190431644.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> response</a> from publisher groups that was as predictable and self-serving as you'd expect, providing quotes and explanations that often had nothing to do with what was actually being proposed. For the most part, this campaign has lived and died on social media and video platforms.</p><p>In one way, this was to be expected. The movement was begun and led by a prominent YouTuber, Ross Scott, so some degree of that platform's culture was always bound to bleed into the fabric. But the extent to which it‚Äôs dominated the whole movement has been utterly fascinating to me. Whatever I think about drama (something YouTube culture is built on to an extent), it clearly hasn't had a negative effect; the petition now has over 300,000 more signatures than it needs, which should hopefully account for whatever percentage of the first one million will be wiped out for being ineligible (you have to live in the EU for this to count, for example, and you can bet a lot of Americans clicked "sign" anyway).</p><p>It's weird, then, but also extremely interesting! This is a <em>real thing</em>, aiming for a positive outcome through genuine, legislative means, a process you would normally expect to see driven by lobbyists and opportunistic politicians and any media outlet they'd want to get in front of. To see it instead live and breathe on YouTube, becoming something driven entirely by the people it will most directly benefit, is extremely cool. It's rare to see a positive democratic outcome in 2025, so (provided this actually leads somewhere) let's cherish them when and where we can, even if people had to feast on some <em>drama </em>to get there.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‚ÄòEmotional Support Chicken Nuggets‚Äô</h3></a><p>It‚Äôs a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/stop-killing-games-petition-eu-pirate-software-ross-scott]]></content:encoded>

I have a pair of these that I use at a <em>very loud </em>gym, and they do a top-notch job at drowning out my facility's terrible soundtrack so that I can properly listen to Dethklok during sessions. These come with a charging case and have an absurdly strong battery life, so you can use them on the go for a lengthy amount of time before you need to recharge. They also use a USB-C connection, so topping the battery up is fairly simple.</p><p>The other great thing about these earphones is that they can sync up seamlessly with your Apple devices and other hardware with Bluetooth functionality, like a TV. They're also quite comfortable with their silicone ear-tips, but you'll probably want to look for something from the sports department if you're planning to go for a jog as heavy movement can make them sit awkwardly. Still, if you're in the market for a comfortable set of earphones that can pump high-quality audio into your ear canals, these are some of the best on the market right now.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</a> -- $160 (<del>$253</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZB3KNML?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZB3KNML?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZB3KNML?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">iPad Air with M3 (11 and 13 inch models)</a>       </h2>                                                                                                                         <div><p>What's the best iPad for your use?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony and Sucker Punch Productions just wrapped up their July 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><u>Ghost of Y≈çtei</u></a> State of Play, showcasing a better look at its world, combat, and new modes ahead of its release date this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgM6poO2JmY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>20-minute gameplay presentation</u></a>, hosted by creative directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox, arrived today to help showcase how Atsu‚Äôs journey will be both familiar and new for players who enjoyed 2020‚Äôs Ghost of Tsushima. Any way you cut it, the Ghost of Y≈çtei State of Play is the closest look at one of the PlayStation 5‚Äôs biggest games of the year that we‚Äôve seen yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who missed out on the State of Play, IGN took the time to gather all of the highlights for you right here. You can check out everything revealed during the presentation below while we wait for more updates ahead of Ghost of Y≈çtei‚Äôs October 2, 2025, release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Sights and Sounds of Ezo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Y≈çtei focuses on Atsu as she seeks revenge against the Y≈çtei Six at any cost. It's a bloody journey that has led Atsu's enemies to fear her, with many worried that she is a legendary Onyro spirit come to life. Ghost of Y≈çtei fuels its journey of vengeance in a completely new way, allowing players to flash back to its protagonist's younger years with the simple press of a button.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveling throughout Ezo means encountering a land far different from the war-torn island of Tsushima. Beautiful in its own right, Ghost of Y≈çtei's new map encourages players to experience Atsu's journey how they please, with Sucker Punch going as far as to say the adventure "focuses on player freedom more than any game" it has ever made. One example of this newfound player freedom can be found in the Clue System, which can lead the player in new directions. While some information gained during an interrogation may see Atsu travel to snowy mountaintops that hide hidden attackers, another may take her to a village ravaged by fire and an army of samurai.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch wants players to choose to focus on combat, exploration, story, or whatever it is that satisfies their quest. However, one recommended way to see all Ezo has to offer involves simply using a spyglass and walking toward whatever catches your eye.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring a 1603 Japan means finding familiar points of interest, such as new Bamboo Strike challenges and even more Hot Springs to relax in, but players can also look forward to taking out difficult fights as a bounty hunter, too. There are also Altars of Reflection, which unlock new abilities for Atsu that will no doubt aid her on her journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost of Y≈çtei Combat Get an Upgrade</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With a hefty price on Atsu's head, players will need to utilize an arsenal of new tools and weapons. While it looks like fans will have plenty of opportunities for standard sword encounters, some new blades will help spice things up. Highlights include the weapons like the katana and spear as well as the more unconvential kusarigama chain blade, the lengthy odachi, and even dual swords. Each offers specific advantages in battle depending on the circumstances, with all weapons featuring upgrades to utilize, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranged combat, meanwhile, will see Atsu primarily using two tools: a bow and a gun. The Ghost of Y≈çtei gameplay showed off a glimpse at how the latter can be used to quickly take out a distant enemy at the cost of stealth. In other words, Atsu comes with a few more tools than Ghost of Tsushima's Jin did, and she's got no reservations when it comes to using them to take out the Y≈çtei Six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between combat encounters and brushes with death, players can allow Atsu to rest under the stars. Here, you can cook food, play music, and even meet up with allies while taking in all Ezo's skies have to offer. With these changes also comes a replacement for the standard journal that is known as Atsu's Wolf Pack. Sucker Punch calls the menu system a "more character-driven way of managing allies and vendors" met during Atsu's journey. It's a straightforward way to see who might have something to offer, and it's wrapped up with art for each face you meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Ghost of Tsushima approached its connection to nature in one way, Ghost of Y≈çtei appears like it may depend the connection players have with the world around them. One way it will do this involves a new wolf companion who, as shown during the State of Play, can tear out an enemy's throat during combat. Traveling through a field of flowers, meanwhile, can give your character a boost while riding on your horse. Sucker Punch also showed off a first look at what appears to be a dense customization system for Atsu's armor as well as the ability to disarm enemies with enough well-timed attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei State of Play July 2025 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Kurosawa Mode Returns Alongside New Immersive Options</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kurosawa Mode, a black-and-white omage to legenadary director Akira Kurosawa, makes its return after fans fell in love with it in Ghost of Tsushima. It's a sign not only that Sucker Punch is happy with the response it received the first time around but that the team remains influenced by some of the prominent artists in the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This influence can also be felt in two additional modes: Miike Mode and Watanabe Mode. As some movie fans might have guessed, the former takes after 13 Assassins director Takashi Miike, moving the camera in closer with more blood and more mud. The latter, meanwhile, brings in the work of Samurai Champloo anime director Shinichir≈ç Watanabe by featuring original lo-fi beats that back moments of exploration and combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights from the Ghost of Y≈çtei State of Play include a first look at photo mode as well as options for Standard English audio, Subtitled English audio, and Samurai Cinema, which features fully voice acted Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Y≈çtei launches October 2, 2025, for PS5. As a last-minute surprise, Sucker Punch promised that special edition Ghost of Y≈çtei PS5 consoles and unique DualSense controllers will also be available at launch.

                <p>If you're looking to upgrade your iPhone, several professionally refurbished models are on sale during Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/phoenix-cms/articles/form?id=6533048/">Prime Day 2025 sale</a>, which ends July 11. Each of the discounted iPhones is certified through the Amazon Renewed Premium program. While these are pre-owned, they're all in full working order, usually just a step away from brand-new in quality. According to Amazon, each item has been professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by professionals, and there are "no visible cosmetic imperfections" when the item is held at arm's length. The only real loss here is the box, as Amazon will instead ship these iPhones out in generic packaging. Products are also eligible for a replacement or refund within 90 days. Note that these deals are only available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a>, so you'll need an active subscription to get the lowest price.</p><p>The upshot of choosing one of the refurbished models listed below is that they're all unlocked, meaning you can use them with your current service provider or take them with you if you decide to switch to a different company in the future. As for the discounted iPhones, there are a variety of models on sale here, though <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DNT2X82Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the iPhone Pro 16 is the best of the bunch</a>, and you can grab one for as low was $816 (was $979). To be fair, smartphone design is very iterative these days, so even the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRJ1HCCP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;th=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYL93774?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iPhone 14</a> are still worth picking up while they're discounted, especially if you haven't upgraded in a while. iPhone Pro and Pro Max models offer more power, better batteries, larger screens, and enhanced cameras compared to the standard models. There's also the larger Pro Max comes down to size mainly, with the Pro Max offering Apple's best hardware of the year on a larger scale.</p><p>These iPhone discounts will only be available during Prime Day, which runs until July 11, so grab them while you can. You'll find more deals on electronics, video games, Blu-rays, and beyond at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/phoenix-cms/articles/form?id=6533048/">GameSpot's Prime Day Deals Hub</a>, or you can browse the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full sale lineup at Amazon</a>.</p><div title="6532971 - Unlocked iPhones - Amazon Renewed P (Prime Day)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3827" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532971 - Unlocked iPhones - Amazon Renewed P (Prime Day)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">iPhone SE 3rd Gen</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BY77JM8T?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$194 (was $260)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Is the iPhone SE outclassed by Apple's other devices?

<p>He voiced multiple iconic characters</p>

<figure><a title="Pok√©mon" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/85dda83b216f8/pokemon.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pok√©mon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pok√©mon fans and the voice acting community are this week mourning the loss of James Carter Cathcart, who has passed away at the age of 71.</p>
<p>Cathcart was known for not only voicing characters like Gary Oak, but also Professor Oak and Team Rocket's James and Meowth later in his career. He also worked on other series like Yu-Gi-Oh! (Weevil Underwood) and Sonic the Hedgehog (Vector).</p>
<p>Voice actor Erica Schroeder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7dvZ8OAmN/?igsh=MWR6MHU0c2c4eXAxNQ%3D%3D">confirmed his passing on social media</a>, noting how he was "one of the most joyful, exuberant, kind-hearted and talented souls" and a master of the "pen, piano and microphone".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rest in peace dear sweet man. I will miss you. The community will miss you. The world will miss you. One of the most joyful, exuberant, kind-hearted and talented souls no longer walks with us. James Carter Cathcart you were one of a kind, a gentle, beautiful, playful genius and I was happy to call you my friend.<br>
Master of the pen, piano and microphone. Friend to many. Loving father and husband. Thank you for your gifts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pok√©mon community has taken to social media to pay its respects with messages like the following being shared to honour Cathcart's life and career:</p>


<p>Cathcart called time on his voice acting career in 2023 after he was diagnosed with throat cancer, but was still able to lend his voice to the original Pok√©mon series‚Äô finale, which aired in the same year.</p>
<p>On behalf of the community here at Nintendo Life, we extend our deepest sympathies to James' family and friends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After recently admitting that it had a ‚Äúspectacularly terrible response‚Äù to Joy-Con grip detachment complaints with its Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case, Dbrand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lwrl9q/joycon_detachment_update_part_3_we_fixed_it/">has some good news</a>: it says its redesigned Joy-Con grips fix the issue <em>and</em> the company will be able to mass produce them.</p><p>Dbrand had already promised it would be replacing the grips for everyone, and now we know that the replacement will be the redesign instead of a refined version of what‚Äôs already available. Here‚Äôs a video from Dbrand showing the Joy-Con not detaching while being held from the Joy-Con with the updated grips.</p><p>In addition to the modification to the Joy-Con grips ‚Äî which Dbrand is calling Joy-Lock ‚Äî the company says it will be sending out silicone friction pads to place on the Killswitch adapter for Nintendo‚Äôs dock to address ‚Äúthe issue of one-handed undocking on our Dock Adapter‚Äù and keep the adapter ‚Äúsnugly seated‚Äù on the dock.</p><p>By ‚Äúearly next week,‚Äù Dbrand says it will ‚Äúshare a production schedule that outlines when you‚Äôll be able to claim your free Joy-Lock replacements, and when you can expect them to ship.‚Äù New production and any unshipped orders will include the Joy-Lock Grips and have the silicone friction pads preinstalled on the Dock Adapter.</p><p>In June, some users of the original Killswitch Switch 2 case found that if they held the console primarily by a Joy-Con while the case and grips were on, the controller <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lgav3g/i_love_my_killswitch_2_buttttttt/">would pop off</a> and the console would drop down. Probably not what you want to have happen to your brand-new Nintendo console.</p><p>Dbrand published a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/">lengthy post</a> about the issue where it argued that ‚Äúnobody routinely holds their Switch 2 like this‚Äù and that Joy-Con detachment only happens if you hold the console in a very specific way. But many users compared that response to when Steve Jobs told people running into iPhone 4 reception issues to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html">‚Äújust avoid holding it that way.‚Äù</a></p><p>The company soon after published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/">a mea culpa post</a> where it said that ‚Äúyou should be allowed to hold it however the fuck you want, without detachment occurring‚Äù and outlined how it was working on two potential fixes: a slightly tweaked version of the original grip and the one with a bigger redesign.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704767/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-lock-grip-detachment-fixed]]></content:encoded>

The way she fights reflects this. Unlike Jin--who only relied on a few weapons to engage enemies in announced duels or assassinate foes from the shadows--Atsu can easily wade into open combat armed with a katana, spear, kusarigama, ≈çdachi, and dual swords, and then also wield a half bow, longbow, teppo, kunai, bombs, and blinding powder.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The gameplay revealed a rock-paper-scissors system to Atsu's arsenal, describing certain weapons as hard counters to specific threats--the ≈çdachi is especially useful for dealing with large enemies, for example, and the dual swords trump spear-wielders. Tsushima had a similar system, but it centered around <em>stances</em>, not weapons. Jin could change his stance and how he held his katana in a fight, with different stances being more adept for handling certain foes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's still unclear whether Y≈çtei's new weapon system is a complete replacement for Tsushima's stance system, but they do seem to embody similar roles in gameplay, so it seems likely.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with all the new weapons, Atsu can also disarm foes and ally with other characters, including a mysterious wolf that accompanies her on her mission of revenge. We didn't see much of this in action, so it's not immediately clear how inviting allies along affects gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Presumably, we'll get another showcase that dives into Atsu's skills and tools when it comes to stealth, as well as what gameplay with allies looks like. But even if we don't, we don't have to wait all that long to see the full game in action. Ghost of Y≈çtei is set to launch for PlayStation 5 on October 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Per Krafton, the three removed executives allegedly would have been eligible for 90% of the $250 million bonus promised to staff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ongoing drama around Subnautica 2's delay and its team's upheaval continues, with the company Krafton issuing a lengthy public statement today accusing the studio's leaders of having "abandoned responsibilities" on the game, alleging they focused on personal projects rather than fulfilling their contracted roles and suggesting the game's delay is their fault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the published statement sent to press, which we've reprinted in full below, Krafton claims it made "multiple requests" to Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director respectively, but claims they both declined. "In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project," the statement reads. "KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton also makes reference to a reported $250 million bonus that was promised to the development team, which would have paid out just a few months from now if it hit revenue targets. Per Krafton, 90% of this bonus was intended to go directly to Cleveland, McGuire, and former CEO Ted Gill prior to their removal from the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement concludes with Krafton promising "fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees...and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full content of the statement is as follows:</p><blockquote>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</blockquote><blockquote>‚Äî <strong> Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment‚ÄìDespite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</strong></blockquote><blockquote>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Background of Leadership Change</strong></blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica‚Äôs unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica‚Äôs future success. We collaborated closely with the studio‚Äôs leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.</blockquote><blockquote>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.</blockquote><blockquote>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership‚Äôs conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON‚Äôs Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team</strong></blockquote><blockquote>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON‚Äôs Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2‚Äôs development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica‚Äôs ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</blockquote><blockquote>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Subnautica 2's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">entire leadership team was replaced last week</a> with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis by owner Krafton, and the game was delayed to 2026.

In a statement to IGN at the time, Krafton claimed the delay was a response to playtester feedback, and had nothing to do with "any contractual or financial considerations."

A report from <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Game Developer</a> details some of the efforts affected by the lost funding, from the University of Washington's Game Research Group, which launched in 2024 to "improve the accessibility of critical video games in cultural heritage institutions for educational purposes," to a grant for a program at Arizona State University helping latinx students develop games about climate change.</p><p dir="ltr">Some projects had their funding removed just as they were about to complete. Rabindra Ratan, an associate professor at Michigan State, was developing a program to "reduce issues of Zoom fatigue and other types of gender and race inequities in the games industry related to virtual meetings." A $1.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation's Future of Work program enabled Ratan's work, but the Trump administration rescinded the grant earlier this year, preventing Ratan and his team from accessing the $200,000 they needed to complete the project.</p><p dir="ltr">Ratan and his crew had built a virtual meeting space, designed to be an effective alternative to Zoom. The platform is still accessible by the public, and Ratan intends to publicize more of the program's findings, but it will remain unfinished for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">Other multi-media projects, like the virtual reality game Paccha, have been affected on multiple fronts. Paccha lets players explore the Peruvian Andes as a student archeologist. The loss of funding has halted collaborations with the San Antonio Museum of Art and with inhabitants and workers in the village of Hualcayan, where the game is set. The developers are now hunting for new places to get funding.</p><p dir="ltr">The video game industry helps drive technological development, exploration, and experimentation, Ratan said, so the cuts could have an impact that reaches beyond the games industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"By limiting research in this industry, it is limiting science as a whole," Ratan said. "There's a slightly more direct negative consequence here in hindering progress in the games industry, namely being that progress in the games industry leads to other industries."</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full report at <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, which goes into more detail about affected projects.</p><p dir="ltr">In other federal government news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbi-seizes-prominent-nintendo-switch-piracy-site/1100-6533098/" data-ref-id="1100-6533098">FBI has seized a Nintendo Switch piracy site,</a> underlining the company's efforts against piracy.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image: Courtesy of The Strong, Rochester, New York</em></p>
