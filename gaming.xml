            <p>Former Xbox president Sarah Bond thanked former CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> and congratulated his successor, Asha Sharma, in a letter sent to all staff as news broke that she was leaving after eight years with the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years yesterday</a> (21st February), amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role, and Xbox president Bond depart the company.</p>
<p>In a message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/">LinkedIn</a>, Bond said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally". She did not share what those next steps would be.</p>
<p>"I've had the privilege of spending time with [new CEO] Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond said.</p>
<p>"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."</p>
<p>Bond added: "I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we've helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world."</p>
<p>She closed on thanking Spencer for his "mentorship and friendship over the years", and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for "his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft".</p>
<p>In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."</p>
<p>Spencer said: "Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve always wanted to go skydiving. <em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em>, from indie developer Aerial_Knight, lets me live out that dream — at least in a safe, virtual kind of way. It also lets me shoot bullets from finger guns, wield laser skulls, and wear cool sunglasses while I’m falling through the air. So maybe it’s better than the real thing.</p><p>Playing as a character named Smoke Wallace, who was bitten by a dragon that gave him the finger gun that can actually shoot bullets, you plummet toward the ground and try to pick off bad guys with that finger gun or by punching them up close. It’s a first-person game, and the perspective really helps sell the feeling that you’re falling through the sky.</p><p>Your goal is to survive each level without taking more than two hits from the bad guys or other dangers like lasers, all while taking down as many enemies as you can as quickly as possible. Your gun has a limited number of bullets, but you can refill your ammo by shooting or flying into balloons you’ll see as you fall.</p><p>Each level is short. I finished most of them in 45 seconds to a minute and a half. At the end, you get a letter grade based on how many enemies you take down, maxing out at S+++ if you reach a certain per-level goal. Since the terrain, obstacles, enemies, and speed boosts spawn in the same spot each level, repeating them to try and get that high score turns each level into fast-paced FPS puzzles you can crack to find the optimal route.</p><p>The game oozes style. Smoke Wallace has purple skin because of his dragon bite. He wears sunglasses, and you can pick different styles that give you different power-ups for finding the eggs, like one that briefly lets you fire six finger guns at a time. Every time you kill a bad guy, the game briefly goes into slow-motion. You’ll even take on bosses that include dragons and flying tanks. And throughout, you’ll be treated to an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.</p><p>I was done with <em>DropShot</em> after about two-and-a-half hours, and I could spend more time grinding S+++ scores if I wanted to. But I think the short length works in the game’s favor: <em>DropShot</em> explores its core mechanics in 50 great levels instead of stretching everything out into something that might wear thin. Even when I was nearing the end, I was still excited every time I flew through the sky.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/875259/dropshot-aerial-knight-review-pc-playstation-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I would not be in this line of work without The Legend of Zelda. It’s my favorite franchise of all time – video game or otherwise – and it’s the series that will always draw me back into gaming and Nintendo, no matter what. My story is not unique; I know several IGN editors who feel the exact same way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not a secret to anyone that Zelda is critically important to so many of us here: we’ve awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/masterpieces">seven different Zelda games a 10/10</a> since IGN was founded in 1996 (the most of any franchise), we were one of very few outlets to recognize <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-awards-2023-every-winner-announced">Tears of the Kingdom as Game of the Year</a> in a packed 2023, and we crowned Breath of the Wild as the greatest game ever made on our most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">Top 100 Games of All Time list</a>, compiled in 2021. It’s a series that’s constantly growing alongside us: how many franchises contain a game that’s essentially redefined a genre? You could argue Zelda would appear on that short list <em>at least </em>twice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So as The Legend of Zelda celebrates its 40th anniversary this weekend, a few of us wanted to share our personal memories of this beloved franchise that we hold most dear. These are our legends of Zelda.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link - By Seth Macy</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a lot of people whose first exposure to The Legend of Zelda franchise was The Adventure of Link. I'd go so far as to say, for most normal, well adjusted people, playing Zelda's NES sequel as their first foray into the series would turn them away from it forever. But not me. No. I was completely hooked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I rented Zelda 2 for a weekend and, when I went to school the following Monday, my thumbs hurt from playing for so long. And the thing is, I didn't really even understand what the hell was going on. I just fell in love with the setting, the weird way it transitioned from an overhead map to self-contained battles, and the massive castles filled with opportunities for Link to die. It set my young imagination on fire and I became obsessed with it from a stylistic and presentational point of view. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Legend of Zelda: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Nintendo's Zelda series has gone from 2D to 3D, from D-Pads to sticks to touch screens to motion controls and back. Here are all of Link's (and Zelda's and Tingle's) adventures over the years. Log in to check off which ones you've played, and add others to your backlog.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/legend-of-zelda-the-complete-playlist" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">I need to point out, at no point did I actually like the gameplay. It was, and remains, brutally difficult, practically impossible for a kid to complete over the course of a rental weekend. The Death Mountain section was where I hung it up many times out of sheer frustration. And even though I was so angry and defeated and saddened to be unable to get through to the end, I still could not resist renting it week after week. I pored through the tattered rental store copy of the manual, captivated by the art style – so distinctively Japanese and at the time, so new and exciting. I borrowed concepts for my own middle-school drawings and rudimentary pen and paper role-playing creations. I also didn't realize it at the time, but that top-down world view and the experience point grind had awakened in me a love for JRPGs I didn't even know existed at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until 2018 I finally beat The Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link, playing through the version available on Nintendo Switch Online, and only because I spammed the hell out of save states. Still, even all these years later, my imagination roars to life when I look at those classic illustrations, and I get a weird inkling to start up another playthrough. Then I remember how brutally unfun it is and I play something else. But man. What a world changing experience it was when I was a kid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening - By Brian Altano</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I hated school. OK, maybe "hated" is too strong a word. I strongly disliked school and it probably didn't like me very much back. To give the place some credit, I loved cracking jokes with my friends before class started. I loved that the cafeteria sold warm, three-for-a-dollar Otis Spunkmeyer cookies.  I loved every art class, the only class where the teacher didn't have to call my parents after and say "Brian is smart and creative, he just doesn't seem to care about this class." See, in 1993, I didn't want to be in school. All I wanted to do was play video games, talk about video games, read about video games, draw video game characters, and eat video game-themed breakfast cereals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A particular video game that I could not stop reading about (specifically in a Nintendo Power preview article that made frequent trips with me everywhere in my school backpack) was The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, the first portable Zelda game ever made, which was making its way to the Nintendo Game Boy. The idea of a Zelda game that I could bring with me everywhere was absolutely mindblowing at the time. I would hop off the school bus every day to do chores, scrounge for coins in the couch cushions, and save money until I had enough to buy Link's Awakening. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But if I’m being honest, the real cash cow was my daily lunch money. Every day I got three bucks for lunch, which back then was enough to buy a sad cafeteria meal and a drink, usually one of those hockey puck shaped breaded chicken patties smooshed between two wet buns with a canned ice tea made by some questionable bootleg brand like “Ol’ Orchard” or “Teaslees” to wash it down. But one day I realized that if I instead bought three Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, I'd A) still be sort of full, B) get to eat cookies for lunch like some sort of child king, and C) save two whole bucks a day to put towards The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I’d have the game in a few weeks without having to do much of anything for it. There were some downsides to this plan, obviously. For starters, I'd have to hide the money from my parents. I'd also have to find a way to buy the game without them knowing it. And lastly, (and I can confirm this as a father now) there’s a very real science fact that if a little kid eats nothing but sugary breakfast cereals and three chocolate chip cookies all day and then needs to focus on school work, that kid will instead bounce off of the walls like an insane little maniac. By now you’re probably figuring out why my teachers didn’t like me very much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few weeks (and probably several detentions and cavities later) I had successfully saved enough money to buy my game. I walked down a highway in New Jersey to that magical, brown roofed, giraffe themed castle known as Toys ‘R’ Us and came home with my treasure tucked inside the big pocket of my winter jacket. To be fair, I paid every penny for it, but by the way I covertly and anxiously snuck it into my house you’d think I stole the thing. To this day, my parents never found out. Dad, if you’re reading this, a different Brian Altano at IGN wrote it, not the one who is your son. He would never steal lunch money to buy a video game. Weird coincidence that there’s two guys here named Brian Altano, right? </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, for the next several months, my Game Boy came with me everywhere, but especially to school. On the bus, I played Zelda. In between classes, I played Zelda. On the playground, I played Zelda. Strangely enough, having video games to play at school between the actual school parts of school helped me focus on my classes more. Instead of day dreaming about when I’d get to play video games next, I’d walk into class feeling fresh after taking down another Zelda dungeon, and then I’d do everything the teacher needed me to do until I could play video games again. My grades started improving and my parents stopped getting as many disappointed phone calls from my teachers. This also coincided with me not eating chocolate chip cookies for lunch anymore, which also definitely helped. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So thank you to Link’s Awakening for being my first portable Zelda game, one of my favorite games ever made, and a game that rescued my academic career and also almost made me fail out of school. Thank you to Otis Spunkmeyer and Geoffrey Giraffe who went on to get married to each other, maybe. Apologies to my teachers and my parents and to the other Brian Altano here who is now in huge trouble with my dad. And happy birthday to The Legend of Zelda, a franchise that I’ll always be there for on day one, to purchase a brand new game with actual money that is no longer earned by eating chocolate chip cookies for lunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Zelda Timeline - By Logan Plant</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Spoilers for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule's history has been passed down countless times from one generation to the next. In that same tradition, I didn't discover my love for Zelda on my own: I inherited it. Just like every child with pointy ears who gets wrapped up in the never-ending battle for Hyrule, this story begins before my time. My dad played The Legend of Zelda at a friend’s house when he and my mom were in college, which led to them eventually saving to buy an NES of their own, just so they could bomb every last wall in that original 8-bit Hyrule. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward roughly a decade to when I entered the picture, born the same year as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time’s launch on N64. My mom tells me I’d sit on her lap and watch my dad explore a new Hyrule, this time in 3D. Like our favorite childhood bedtime stories, I have no recollection of witnessing Link’s journey to stop Ganondorf. I’ve just always known it. This universe of talking trees and evil pigs and boys without fairies carved a home in my mind during my earliest days and hasn’t budged since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is why it should come as no surprise that my first vivid memory comes from Hyrule, too. I’m four now, and my older sister and I are watching my dad fight the final boss of The Wind Waker. The very first thing I remember is Toon Link leaping into the air and plunging the Master Sword straight into Ganondorf’s skull. I was shocked: it was far and away the most violent, gruesome thing I’d ever seen. I recall walking into the living room to tell my mom what had happened, but then everything goes fuzzy again and all I’m left with is the everlasting image of Ganondorf turning to stone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter where I’ve gone, I’ve taken my love for Zelda with me. Breath of the Wild came out when I was in college, and I spent launch night marathoning it on the enormous, blurry TV in the dormitory lounge as my floormates passed by and watched for a bit on their way out to the evening’s events. Once the hall was empty, and the motion-activated overhead lights went dark, there was nothing left but me and the peaceful glow of the Great Plateau. I was confused when my friends returned just a few moments later. “You’re back already?” I asked, only to learn that four hours had glided by in what felt like minutes. That was the first of dozens of long nights with Breath of the Wild, and later, Tears of the Kingdom, which still managed to hijack my sleep schedule years after the days of going to college parties were long gone. Time changes all things, but Zelda has never seemed to mind.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan's Top 10 Zelda Games</h3><p>Only the best version of each game is included.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/MrHurgy/lists/logans-top-10-zelda-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda tells us a tale about an endless cycle of good rising up to ward off evil, and as we eagerly await its next chapter, I can’t help but wonder where I’ll be when a new 3D entry finally arrives. Maybe I’ll have a child of my own by then, and they’ll watch me take my first steps into whatever wild world Nintendo offers us next. Maybe their first memory will be something creepy or strange in a Zelda game years from now. I like to think they’ll play a new Zelda while off at college, homesick for their childhood but equally giddy to be experiencing a brand new take on Hyrule for themselves. And hopefully, they’ll always call their parents and siblings to talk about Zelda, just like I do to this day. That's a cycle I wouldn't mind repeating for generations to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Next Fest is happening right now, which is where developers releasing games on Steam all agree to launch demos of their games to encourage Wishlist additions and give players an excuse to check out games early. We have not played all the Steam Next Fest demos. There are a lot. But here are a few that we've played and enjoyed.</p><h2>Replaced</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/niPUvgTgnI8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The quick pitch here is Cyberpunk aesthetics, Limbo/Inside cinematic platformer puzzles and mood, and Batman Arkham combat. It seems to be a potent mix that is already really impressing us. You can watch us play and discuss the demo above.</p><h2>Denshattack</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGk7sIPzvQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Denshattack is a game that demos very, very well. In it, you control a train that can leap and stunt between tracks in a sort-of-post-apoclyptic Japan as you try to be the best train race trick performer in the world. It plays like a modern Dreamcast game and it's very cool. You can watch us play it above.</p><h2>Planet of Lana II</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTDTuPl56G8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unlike the other two games listed here, Planet of Lana II is a bit more of a known quantity, as any sequel is. I mentioned Limbo/Inside above and Planet of Lana II takes heavy inspiration from those games, and does it well. The sequel is shaping up to be a worthwhile follow-up to the first game and you can check out the demo with us above.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/20/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-20]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has declared the Saints Row franchise is "dead".</p>
<p>Last November, Stockman revealed he wanted to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly received 2022 reboot – developed after he had left Volition – and claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-saints-row-designer-says-unloved-2022-reboot-missed-the-mark-but-the-big-news-is-embracer-wants-him-to-pitch-a-revival">publisher Embracer Group had reached out to hear more</a> about his ideas.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, however, and Stockman is now less confident, responding to a fan on Discord that IP holder Embracer has "ghosted him" and "has zero ability to do anything with [the franchise]".</p>
<p>"[H]onestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," Stockman said in reply to a commenter who'd shared their dismay that the last canon game was released "a decade ago".</p> <div>

<p>"I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it," he added. "I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward, but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Stockman's comments come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team">after the CEO of Saber Interactive had some pretty damning words to say about the reboot</a> and its developer, Volition, after it was shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme.</p>
<p>"They didn't know what they were building," Matt Karch said. "They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>I found the 2022 game to be a very mediocre affair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">when I reviewed it back in 2022</a>, calling it a reboot that "won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises".</p>

            <guid>1442623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Four years after its release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s Steam Deck</a> is still the most popular handheld PC around and for good reason. The portable gaming device is easy to use, can play most 2D games you install on it with ease, handles 3D games fairly well, and can even be modded and tweaked if you so desire. It’s a marvelous machine, and if you are here, you likely own one or are about to buy one and want some video game recommendations. Thankfully, you’ve come to the right list, my friend.</p> <p>Below you’ll find the 15 best PC games to play on your <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-nintendo-switch-performance-pc-emulation-1849827018">Steam Deck</a>. For this list, we tried to include a mix of “classic” Steam Deck games—yes,<em> Vampire Survivors</em> is on here—as well as some titles that don’t always get mentioned when talking about the system. This list also features some bigger games as well as experiences that might be perfect for killing time at a bus stop or a short train ride. Lastly, for this list, we tried to stick to games that run well on the Deck without having to make weird tweaks or install mods.</p>

 <p>Hopefully, at least one of these games is what you were looking for and lets you enjoy your Steam Deck a little more.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>  <p>Any list of best Steam Deck games is legally obligated to include <em>Vampire Survivors.</em> At this point, Valve should just pay Poncle some amount of money to have <em>Vampire Survivors</em> pre-installed on all Steam Decks. Anyway, yeah, it’s cheap, fun, runs great, and is a perfect game for the Steam Deck. I’d say play it, but you likely already have.</p>

 <h2><em>Stardew Valley</em></h2>  <p>Another “legally obligated” recommendation, but hey, <em>Stardew Valley</em> is great, and it runs like a dream on Steam Deck. And if you want to get wild, unlike the Switch port of this popular cozy slice of life farming sim, <em>Stardew Valley</em> on Steam Deck can be modded. You don’t need to do that to play it, to be clear, but if you want to, it is an option on Deck.</p>

 <h2><em>Balatro</em></h2>  <p>Okay, last one of these “legally obligated” entries, but yes, <em>Balatro</em> is an incredible game. One of the best games released in the last few years. Playing this strange poker rogue-like with bizarre joker cards is a blast regardless of where you play. On Steam Deck, <em>Balatro</em> is a treat, won’t kill your battery, and takes up little room. A no-brainer to toss on your Deck.</p> <h2><em>Dave the Diver</em></h2>  <p>Some of the best games for the Steam Deck are ones built around “runs.” Games built like this let you hop in for a bit, then put the console to sleep when your bus arrives or your meeting starts. <em>Dave the Diver,</em> being split into different days, makes it one of these perfect Steam Deck games. Also helping is <em>Dave the Diver</em>‘s 2D art style which the Deck can handle without breaking a sweat. It’s never been easier to catch and cook digital fish on the go.</p>

 <h2><em>Blue Prince</em></h2>  <p>Someone told me this was their Steam Deck bedtime game, and I get it. Slowly exploring a cozy but mysterious mansion that shifts every time you visit and is filled with puzzles to solve is a perfect activity to engage in for a bit before calling it a night. <em>Blue Prince</em>‘s 3D visuals don’t push the Steam Deck hard, and it plays effortlessly on a gamepad, making this a fantastic way to play one of 2025’s best-reviewed games.</p> <h2><em>Dredge</em></h2>  <p>For those looking for something creepy to play on their Steam Deck, but not interested in a really scary game, <em>Dredge</em> is a great option. Not only does <em>Dredge</em> run well on the Deck, but it’s yet another game divided up into days, letting you jump in for a bit of fishing in its unsettling waters without making you commit to hours of cutscenes and action. Perfect for a lunch break run or a quick bit of game time on the toilet. Look, I’m not here to judge where or how you use the Deck, okay?</p> <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>  <p>You could probably fill up a Steam Deck with nothing but a ton of auto-shooter games that play a lot like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. (In fact, there’s one more coming up on this list.) But among&nbsp;the many, many games that followed in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>‘ wake, <a href="https://kotaku.com/deep-rock-galactic-survival-vampire-survivors-roguelike-1851276484"><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></a> is one of the best. Adding sci-fi dwarves and mining and sub-challenges to the formula helps elevate this one beyond a mere clone. It runs well on Deck, too, though its 3D visuals will eat up battery faster than <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Hades / Hades 2</em></h2>  <p>At one point, this list contained separate entries for <em>Hades</em> and its 2025 sequel. Then the list just had one, but mentioned the other. Let’s just save some time and internet ink and combine them into one entry. Both <em>Hades</em> games are impeccably designed action roguelikes that feature hot Greek gods, plenty of action, and gorgeous visuals that look like the coolest animated movie ever.&nbsp; And both <em>Hades</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064"><em>Hades 2</em></a> play like a dream on Steam Deck. You really can’t go wrong with your choice.</p> <h2><em>Sektori</em></h2>  <p><em>Geometry Wars</em> was a good game. What if someone made a new one? Well, they did, and it’s called <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-twin-stick-shooter-is-the-new-geometry-wars-and-it-rules-2000650227"><em>Sektori</em>, and it’s awesome</a> on any platform you play it on. And that includes the Steam Deck, where <em>Sektori</em> looks and runs flawlessly while delivering fast and fluid twin-stick shooter fun. You can’t ask for much more for $15.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-valve-pc-steam-deck-namco-bandai-stuttering-1848664299">When <em>Elden Ring</em> first arrived back in 2022</a>, the Steam Deck ended up being one of the best places to play FromSoftware’s hit open-world RPG. Flash forward to today, and it’s still a damn fine way to enjoy <em>Elden Ring.</em> It might not look as crisp as it will on a PS5 or a high-end PC, and it will eat your battery up quickly, but that’s all worth it to have such a fantastic game playable anywhere.</p> <h2><em>Resident Evil 2</em></h2>  <p>A surprising number of modern <em>Resident Evil</em> games run well on the Steam Deck, but I still think the remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em> might be the best one to play on Valve’s portable PC. It’s not too big, doesn’t push the system too hard, and is a great installment in the franchise. It might not be as easy to drop in and out of this game as others on the list, but <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is still a great choice to play on the Deck. Just maybe leave the lights on?</p> <h2><em>Big Hops</em></h2>  <p>Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-could-learn-something-from-this-incredible-3d-platformer-2000660289"><em>Big Hop</em>s</a> was just released in January, but that doesn’t change the fact that this 3D platformer heavily inspired by <em>Mario</em> deserves a place on this list. Not only because it’s a joyful and creative platformer about a frog with a very useful tongue, but also because it looks sharp as heck and runs perfectly at 60FPS on the Deck. The world needs more fun 3D platformers, and <em>Big Hops</em> is here to answer that call.</p>

 <h2><em>Warframe</em></h2>  <p>For a few different reasons, there aren’t many big live-service online games available for the Steam Deck. So, free-to-play ninja shooter <em>Warframe</em> being fully playable on the device is very cool. If you’ve always wanted to slice up robots and aliens while running 70MPH in a cyber ninja suit, this is the game for you. And you can do all of that and more while killing time at the airport, assuming you have a solid wi-fi connection, as <em>Warframe</em> is an online-only game.</p> <h2><em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em></h2>  <p>A 2D pixel art brawler is just about the perfect video game for the Steam Deck, and <em>TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</em> is one of the best you can find on Steam. So of course we added it to this list. And for those of you going “But this is better with other people!” don’t worry. You can just connect multiple gamepads to the Steam Deck and do some portable brawlin’ with pals wherever you want. Or connect your Steam Deck to a TV and enjoy one of the best <em>TMNT</em> games ever made.</p> <h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>  <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;but 3D and weirder is the elevator pitch for <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591"><em>Megabonk</em></a>. And it might be one of the best things to play on a Steam Deck. Even when the hordes of enemies get massive, the game’s framerate stays steady, and it feels perfect to play on a gamepad. The world doesn’t need many more auto-shooters, but it’s nice that we got one more that’s as good and fun as <em>Megabonk</em>. And it’s just $10.</p>

What will the future hold for Xbox with Phil Spencer departing and a new CEO coming in who has little to no experience of the gaming market? It’s been a downward trend for Xbox through this generation as a platform, and we’ll have to see if Microsoft is intent to accelerate this for their broader gaming approach, or if they’ll turn things around.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1259245e69a92"><a title="Zelda NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1259245e69a92/zelda-nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all pulled a 'Wait, Mario is <em>how old??</em>' last year as the prized plumber and the NES celebrated their 40th anniversaries, and what do you know, we're about to do it all over again for little old Link.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> is 40 years old today (in Japan, at least). On <strong>21st February 1986</strong>, Nintendo introduced the world to the fantasy land of Hyrule, complete with legendary princesses, magical triangles, evil pig men, and a little boy in a green nightcap. It was the first time anyone had heard Koji Kondo's iconic title theme — apparently substituted in at the eleventh hour after Nintendo discovered Maurice Ravel's 'Boléro' wasn't up for grabs — or read the words "It's dangerous to go alone! Take this". Without it, many of our favourite games of all time simply would not exist. So yes, we think this is a birthday worth acknowledging.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>We've all heard the stories about Shigeru Miyamoto's inspirations for the game, as he set out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619152426/https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/19/415568892/q-a-shigeru-miyamoto-on-the-origins-of-nintendos-famous-characters">replicate the feeling of exploring the woods and caves outside of his childhood home</a> as a boy. And that's exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Nintendo's big player from the year before, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>, was all about moving from left to right, something that vaguely resembled the 'quick fix' arcade experience for a new home console generation, the culmination of everything Nintendo had learned to that point.</p>
<p>Zelda was different. Launching with the Famicom Disk System (also 40 today), there was an open world at your disposal, items waiting in every dungeon, and rarely any set instruction to 'go here next". It's easy to overlook just how revolutionary and fresh the format was.</p>
<p>The story, by comparison, was something a little more familiar. Drawing inspiration from classic fairytales and high fantasy worlds established by the likes of Tolkien, Takashi Tezuka's story of good overcoming evil is a timeless one. An elf-like boy embarks on a quest to collect some magic rocks, overthrows a power-hungry prince, rescues the princess and restores peace to the land. We've all heard it before, but you can't knock its simplicity. And hey, did Tolkien ever write anything with a follow-up 'Second Quest' for those who have finished the first one? <em>Oh wait</em>...</p>
<figure data-uuid="1a7a7fd341391"><a title="Zelda NES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1a7a7fd341391/zelda-nes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remarkably, it still feels good today. We're not going to sit here and say that the original TLoZ packs quite the same open-world magic as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead</a> in 2026, but play any of them after experiencing this first slice of Hyrule, and you'll spot Nintendo's fingerprints everywhere.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's always been pretty easy to get your hands on the original game in the four decades since its launch. Be it through re-released GBA or GameCube packages, Virtual Consoles, Nintendo Switch Online, special edition Game &amp; Watches or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> retro systems, we've never been too far away from a way to dive into The Legend of Zelda, and every format will be someone's first.</p>
<p>And so, as we inflate our big '4' and '0' balloons, hang a banner, and let out a celebratory "HYYYYAAA", we thought we'd throw the reminiscing to you lovely lot. The Legend of Zelda has been playable in so many different forms, but which was your first experience with it?</p>
<p>We've listed each and every platform variant in the poll below, from the Famicom Disk System all the way up to NSO. Let's see where it started for everyone!</p>

What a week, eh?</p>
<p>Clearly not content with just the one surprise announcement this week, Nintendo delivered <em>two</em> almighty news drops to our door. First, we got an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-gets-nintendo-switch-2-upgrade-out-now">out-of-the-blue shadow drop</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (which looks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-xenoblade-chronicles-x-and-mira-are-even-more-magnificent-on-switch-2">really rather lovely</a>), and then there was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, which are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-officially-revealed-for-switch">now available to pre-order</a> and will go live after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">Presents showcase</a> next week.</p>
<p>We had plenty of reviews for you, too, as we shared our thoughts on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">8/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_mermaids_curse">Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse">7/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_bomberman_collection">Super Bomberman Collection</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">8/10</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_entropy_effect_x">BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/blazblue-entropy-effect-x">7/10</a>), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/love-eternal">6/10</a>).</p>
<p>Phew, we need some quality gaming time after all that! Let's see what everyone's up to this weekend.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I've been back on a bit of a Pokémon kick ever since EUIC last weekend, and have been enjoying getting back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_emerald">Pokémon Emerald</a> during my public transport trips. The GBA games are some of my very favourites, so, as you can imagine, I am rather pumped to pick up FireRed &amp; LeafGreen next week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's just more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a>. I'm a predictable man of simple tastes, what can I say?</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>This is a very easy one for me this week! When I'm sick, I make poor decisions, so last weekend I made the decision to get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-dreamlight-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>. I played the heck out of it back on Xbox during early access and always ummed and aahed about getting it for Switch, considering what I heard about the poor optimisation. On Switch 2, however, it's been running somewhat decently, which only makes me more excited for the upgrade next month. I've already sunk in close to 35hrs since getting it, and there's no stopping me yet. I forgot how much I loved it!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'm dogsitting, so I wonder what games she'll want to play. Maybe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wobbledogs">Wobbledogs</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/sims_2_pets">The Sims 2 Pets</a>? If only someone had made a Best Dogs list instead of Best Horses. I'm not horsesitting any time soon.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a>. In preparation for the new one, and figuring out if I really want to buy a Switch 2 just to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a>...</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Senior Video Producer</h2>
<p>Is a windfall of games a thing? Because that's what's happened to me this week. As a result, I frankly don't know what I'm going to be playing. No doubt I'll dabble in a little <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a>, get a bit further in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lorelei_and_the_laser_eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> (which is currently on sale), but I think I'm going to have to plan a bit more before I launch back into my current playthrough of Xenoblade Chronicles X. I've been tactfully putting it off hoping a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition would happen, and happen it so very much did.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-aos-ossiarch-bonereapers-review-them-bones</link>
            <guid>1442575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To hear the clacking of bones on hard stone is to know your doom, unless <em>you’re</em> the one controlling the Ossiarch Bonereapers in <em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em>! I got a chance to check out the brand new Battletome and some new units up for preorder courtesy of Games Workshop, so let’s open up the catacombs and check it out!</p><h2><strong>Ossiarch Bonereapers Battletome - What’s In It?</strong></h2><p>Like all good <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar </em>Battletomes, the new Ossiarch Bonereapers Battletome features everything you need to get an army of these clattering soldiers up and running.</p><h3><strong>What’s The Lore?</strong></h3><p>The book starts with a healthy heaping of lore, diving into these Chosen of Nagash with the level of depth and storytelling we’ve come to expect from Games Workshop.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-dramatic-shot.jpg?itok=JBAbFy2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="580">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-dramatic-shot.jpg?itok=O-bRR3ID 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="580">
                  

  </picture><p>Highly organized, far more so than your typical army of undead, the Ossiarch Bonereapers consist of legions of skeletons and construct hewn of bone and brought to life by soul fragments.&nbsp;</p><p>No pity, no mercy, no feeling at all except unwavering loyalty remains in these legions - making them a particularly deadly adversary for just about anyone with a beating heart.</p><p>Along with vivid descriptions of who the Bonereapers are, the lore section of the book (over forty pages) also tells the story of their impassive leader, Orpheon Katakros, Mortarch of the Necropolis. From his rise as Nagash’s leader to his various and impressive exploits, we get a clean picture of the undead captain.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-leader.jpg?itok=vf9mz60I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="973">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-leader.jpg?itok=083rFkhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="973">
                  

  </picture><p>From there, we learn about the various divisions within the army, what they’re made of (spoiler: bones!), and how the Bonereapers, like so many forces in the world of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, are out to smash and destroy the Skaven rat-men (at least there’s <em>something</em> most everyone can agree on).</p><h3><strong>The Rules</strong></h3><p>Rules-wise, the new Battletome walks us through what we need to bring this army to (undead) life! We start with Battle Traits. The Immortal Elite trait gives your army access to a number of “Relentless Discipline” points equal to a value attached to one of your Bonereaper heroes.</p><p>You can spend these points to access five valuable abilities, including spending a point to add 3” to a unit’s movement, spending a point to allow a unit that retreated to also charge, give a unit Ward (5+), and more - all until end of turn.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-battletome.jpg?itok=rmUiCSrB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="706">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ossiarch-bonereapers-battletome.jpg?itok=qM6wFiXU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1000" height="706">
                  

  </picture><p>There are also four battle formations to choose from when building your army: Grim Sentinels (strong against incoming charges), Nadirite Wedge (adding additional grits), The Inevitable Empire (lowering your opponent’s control value), and Remorseless Conquerors (adding to your run ability). It’s a clever way to begin building an army around a central theme, with each battle formation having its own distinct use.</p><p>There are also Heroic Traits which you can attach to a hero, making them uniquely strong and a bit more customized, rare relics you can give to a hero to help in their unwavering conquest, and spell lore that can empower your army’s weapons, douse your enemy’s in dark flaming magic, and drain your foes very life-force.</p><p>From there we dive into the Warscrolls for all available units, from the God of Death himself down to lowly foot soldiers, before moving onto Spearhead rules, Path to Glory rules, Armies of Renown, and Regiments of Renown. All in all, it’s a well-thought out and nicely paced new update to the rules for this iconic army.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Now let’s check in with the new units I got a chance to preview.</p><h2><strong>Ossiarch Bonereapers - New Units</strong></h2><p>Included with my review package from Games Workshop were the following four new model releases for the Ossiarch Bonereapers:</p><h3><strong>Liege-Mortek</strong></h3><p>First up is the Liege-Mortek, the infantry officers of the Ossiarch Bonereapers army. Stats are: Move 5”, Save 3+, Control 2, Health 5, with a 6+ ward save, and 5 Relentless Discipline points.</p><p>His Commander’s Weapon (5 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 2) pairs nicely with his <strong>Clinical Efficiency </strong>ability which allows a friendly visible Mortek Guard, Mortek Triaxes, or Mortek Crawler unit that hasn’t used an Attack ability yet to fight or shoot right after the Liege-Mortek fights, and they add 1 to their attacks for the rest of the turn.</p><p>This represents the flavor of an army officer well, as they lead the attack and then command a nearby unit to strike quickly.</p><h3><strong>Mortis Reapers</strong></h3><p>You’d think with a perfectly skilled and precise army, there’d be no room (or outside the box thinking) for an assassin - but you’d be wrong, as the Mortis Reapers prove! Stats: Move 6”, Save 5+, Control 1, Health 2.</p><p>With their Reaper’s Blades (3 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 1) (Anti-Hero (+1 Rend)), they slip behind enemy lines to dish out serious damage.</p><p>Their <strong>Necrocaches</strong> ability allows them to, at the end of any turn, roll a D3 for each enemy unit they’re in combat with. On a 2+, they inflict that many mortal wounds and then can move 6” (including through combat ranges of enemy units, but they cannot end the move in combat).</p><p>They also have the <strong>No Escaping The Tithe</strong> ability, which reads as such: Declare: If there are no enemy units within 6” of this unit, pick a terrain feature within 3” of this unit to be the target. Effect: Remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up again wholly within 3” of the target and more than 9” from all enemy units.</p><p>In other words, you can do a little bit of a hop around the board if no enemy units are daring enough to get close to your Mortis Reapers.</p><p><strong>Mortek Triaxes</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The Mortek Triaxes are up next, offering some ranged support. Stats: Move 4”, Save 5+, Control 1, Health 1, and a ward save of 6+.</p><p>They strike from a distance with their Osseous Bow (Range: 18”, 2 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 1), and they are ranged control masters.</p><p>Their Atavistic Nightmares ability allows them to move Balefire Braziers tokens around the board which reduces an enemy’s control score by 3 (wow!), and prevents healing or returning slain models!</p><p>It’s very rare to see this kind of ranged control support, and I think it’s a clever and really interactive and fun addition to the army (and the <em>AoS</em> in general).</p><h3><strong>Liege-Kavalos On War Chariot</strong></h3><p>Finally, thundering in is the Liege-Kavalos on War Chariot, an imposing model with Move 10”, Save 3+, Control 2, and Health 12. He’s also got a 6+ ward save, and offers his army a whopping 6 Relentless Discipline points.</p><p>Along with his Commander’s Blade (5 Attacks, 3+ Hit, 4+ Wound, Rend 1, Damage 2) (Charge (+1 Damage)), his abilities help him get into position and brush off attacks. The <strong>Grind Them To Dust</strong> ability triggers once per turn during your army phase, and lets you get a free pile-in for him and up to two visible friendly Kavalos War Chariots wholly within 12”. You pile-in, then pick an enemy unit in combat with the target and roll D3, on a 2+ you deal mortal damage to that enemy unit.</p><p>He also has the <strong>Masterful Charioteer</strong> ability, which gives him and up to 2 friendly Kavalos War Chariots within 12” of him Ward (5+) for the rest of the turn.</p><p>So you want to be charging in with him, but as a single unit charging sometimes leaves you in an awkward position or vulnerable - which is where these abilities will be crucial!</p><h2>Ossiarch Bonereapers - Final Thoughts</h2><p>I’m thrilled with the new models for the Ossiarch Bonereapers. Along with looking extremely cool, they’re all built around synergies with existing models - or offer up a new patch the army needed.</p><p>I’m especially fond of the Mortis Reapers, who are just this skulking, creeping force of death hunting down heroes and throwing grave-sand bombs. Extremely cool and wildly flavorful!</p><p>What do you think of these new releases? Will you be picking up the new Battletome and models?

            <guid>1442572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">We're early in the year, and with it, a new Warband and Rivals Deck is about to be released for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-starter-set-2023-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a60a44-5c6a-4787-be2e-abd18b18f684" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a>. This time around, we have <em>Thanatek's Tithe</em>, a Warband of corpse reapers led by Thanatek in search of the 'truebone'. The <em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck is all about holding Treasure Tokens to power up your attacks in a strange 'King of the Hill' twist on Warhammer Underworlds.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Thanatek's Tithe</em> is a Warband of five fighters. The leader Thanatek is accompanied by two Mortis Reapers and two Retainers. To start off, the look of this Warband is fantastic. Thanatek weilds a bladed dagger as well as a variety of magical objects. From there, the other groupings match each other quite closely.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-thanatek-s-tithe-miniatures.jpg?itok=2QQhm-Is 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whu-thanatek-s-tithe-miniatures.jpg?itok=BAaw5_BV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Each Mortis Reaper, as you might expect from the name, has two blades and snarled faces ready for attack, while the Retainers have heads that look like coffins. I'm a bit fan of when a design is legible, and from whatever distance it's very easy to pick out who is who in your Warband. It also helps that each of the Mortis Reapers and the Retainers shares the same stats, creating a very easy-to-interpret hierarchy.</p><p dir="ltr">While they're easy to spot from a distance, their play is far more technical. There are a number of abilities that I'll go through that are tied to the Leader, Mortis Reaper, or Retainer.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Leader, when at the start of a turn, you can pick an enemy fighter to be the posessor, basically a target for the turn, and every time it takes damage as part of a friendly attack, your Retainers can all be pushed one hex closer.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Collect Cadaver Tokens In <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The movement of your Retainers plays into this Warband's unique mechanic, cadaver tokens. You can gain cadaver tokens after a friendly fighter successfully hits a target who is adjacent to a Retainer.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-thanatek-s-tithe-abilities.jpg?itok=r0P7VsdE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">These cadaver tokens can be spent in a variety of ways:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e3cf94b7b1eafaaf9e780b46b3e9b5c8e">In your Power Phase, if a Mortis Reaper has been slain, you can remove a number of cadaver tokens and roll that many dice. With a good roll, you can raise that fighter.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e73c257a7c379a3200e259d32a5f57471">Alternatively, in your Power Phase, you can remove cadaver tokens and replace them with dice rolls to have Retainers attack enemy fighters who are adjacent</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="e0da62fd9f8d2651ed3049d94ce5bc95c">Lastly, you can remove cadaver tokens equal to the bounty of a character to Inspire it</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This movement of Mortis Reapers and Retainers is even better when you have access to your Leaders 'Soul-Linked Constructs' ability, which lets them use their melee attack with a friendly Retainer as the source of the attack.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The flow of this deck is to pick a target, move your Retainers in and get them close, earn your cadaver tokens, and then use them to keep your army alive, attacking, and powered up. Once your fighters are in place, attack with your Leader from anywhere you want on the board for additional chances at damage.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck</h2><p dir="ltr">As opposed to <em>Thanatek's Tithe</em>, which is all about moving through the board and stalking your enemies, the <em>Nexus of Power</em> Rivals Deck is about finding a good Treasure Token and holding down the fort to increase your range.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Friendly fighters are covetous while they are within 1 hex of a treasure token. Friendly covetous fighters' Range 1 melee weapon (excluding Upgrades) has +1 Range while they hold a treasure token."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">There's a far simpler focus in the <em>Nexus of Power </em>Rivals Deck: you should secure your upgrade and hold it in place.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-full-deck.jpg?itok=g0aLmcF8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-full-deck.jpg?itok=YvToQhDi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">For your objectives, you'll see rewards for melee attacks within a hex of a treasure token, having covetous fighters in enemy territory, getting a critical hit with a covetous fighter, and more. If there's some way to strategically move or attack with one or many covetous fighters then you should expect to earn some points with it.</p><p dir="ltr">This trend continues in the Power Deck. So many abilities read like standard Rival Deck cards with abilities like pushing a fighter 1 hex, give a weapon attack Grapple and Brutal, increase the range of a weapon +2. But ALL of these abilities also include the stipulation that it needs to occur within 1 hex of a treasure token.</p><p dir="ltr">For this Rivals Deck you're likely going to want to pick a bulky Warband that is able to post up at a singular location, or nearby Treasure Tokens, and do everything you can to bait your opponent into engagement to reap the benefits of the <em>Nexus of Power.</em></p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-objective-card.jpg?itok=RcFfudZX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Put Them Together, Or Keep Them Apart</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, when we've seen Games Workshop release a Warband and Rivals Deck together, there's some level of synergy that we can see between them. Abilities of the Warband complement the strategy of the Rivals Deck. For these two I found it was quite the opposite.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Thanatek's Tithe</em> always wants to be on the move and pushing towards whatever poor enemy fighter has been designated as the possessor, and from there the whole Warband slowly but surely skulks up on their opponents. The <em>Nexus of Power</em> is instead about positioning yourself favorably and then not moving far to maximise the Power Cards you can use and your own stat benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, these two might get the most entertaining battles going on by going face-to-face with one another instead of working together.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/whu-nexus-of-power-power-cards.jpg?itok=hIfAtkS_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Warhammer Underworlds Thanatek's Tithe Warband </em>and <em>Nexus of Power Rivals Deck</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">While these two components might not work together what it does offer is a healthy variety of gameplay for anyone interested in getting a very defensive deck or a very aggressive deck. If one of these offerings doesn't speak to you then the other one certainly will.</p><p dir="ltr">For this Warband more than others I also just can't get past how fantastic the miniatures look from a distance and how legible they are.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Warhammer Underworlds Thanatek's Tithe Warband and Nexus of Power Rivals Deck were reviewed with copies provided by the publisher - All photos were taken over the course of the review</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Vehicles Will Be Improved in Dedicated Labs Tests]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vehicles-improved-testing-labs/</link>
            <guid>1442569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dice/" id="2384">DICE</a> is acutely aware of the issues that poorly-balanced and unoptimized vehicles are causing in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a>. It’s something that must be added to the ever-growing list of player woes, given the state of the shooter at present.</p>



<p>Even the arrival of the season two update did little to revitalize the ‘game-changing’ Battlefield 6, which was released last October with a goal to bring about a major resurgence for the franchise. Now, DICE is preparing to tackle the issues in the game piecemeal and has identified vehicle feedback as being a cause for concern.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-weakest-vehicles-are-being-upgraded-hopefully">Battlefield 6’s Weakest Vehicles Are Being Upgraded (Hopefully)</h2>



<p>In a recent interview, DICE advised that it’s starting to look at player feedback around vehicles. This is one of the most tentative, divisive topics in the Battlefield 6 space, which continues to be contentious, even amongst the most die-hard fans of the franchise. It’s not in a good spot, and the game that the company thought would hit 100 million players has… Not done that.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-agrees-that-some-battlefield-6-vehicles-are-death-traps-and-is-planning-a-labs-test-dedicated-to-vehicle-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, DICE’s Kit Eklöf said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to take the light vehicle feedback with me to the team from you today.</p>



<p>But I also want to promote that there’s a Battlefield Labs test coming up where we’re going to test some vehicle improvements around this issue, specifically because we’ve heard the feedback that vehicles are death traps. We are going to try a package of vehicle improvements on Labs very soon, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a small thing, but a warranted one nonetheless. In Battlefield, many matches live and die by the vehicles players have at their disposal, and having an entire class that splinters into pieces at the first sight of incoming fire is <strong>not </strong>ideal.</p>



<p>Foot soldiers feel all too overpowered in Battlefield 6, effortlessly taking down hulking MBTs without much of a concern. That leaves a game that’s rooted in destruction feeling less destructive than you might like. The sight of a tank lurching towards you used to instill you with a sense of dread, but now it’s just a sign to switch classes and whomp it with a rocket or two, no drama.</p>

            <p>
Xbox CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role. Additionally, Xbox president Sarah Bond will depart the company.
</p>
<p>
"Last fall, I shared with [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life," Spencer - who joined Microsoft in 1988 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-named-new-boss-of-xbox">became the boss of Xbox in 2014</a> - wrote in an email to staff. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead."
</p>
<p>
“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team," Spencer continued. "She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right." Spencer added he'll remain in an advisory role "through the summer".
</p>
<p>
As part of his retirement announcement, Spencer also confirmed the departure of Xbox president Sarah Bond, who he said had "decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter." He called Bond's work "instrumental during a defining period for Xbox", wishing her "the very best in what comes next". Bond joined Xbox in 2017 and was named Xbox president in 2022. As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Matt Booty, he's received a new role amid Xbox's significant executive overhaul, and will now work closely with the newly appointed Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.
</p><p>
In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."
</p>
<p>
"I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players," Sharma continued. "The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward... We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways."
</p>
<p>
Sharma also made what she called "three commitments", referencing "great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". On games, she said Microsoft - which has made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping cuts across its gaming division in recent years,</a> including layoffs and team closures - will "empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas." She also promised to "take risks" and "enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."
</p>
<p>
On the return of Xbox, Sharma said the company would "celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are... Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise." Sharma did not explicitly reference the "next-gen hardware" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">announced by then-president Sarah Bond last year</a> amid reports Microsoft was ending console development.
</p><p>
On the future, Sharma spoke of the "reinvention of play", pledging to "invent new business models and new ways to play" that will "meet the moment". This will include the building of "a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories". Additionally, she promised the team will "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."
</p>
<p>
"The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through," Sharma concluded. "We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not. Thank you for welcoming me into this journey."
</p>
<p>
In a separate email to staff, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Sharma would bring "deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth." He also thanked Spencer for his "extraordinary leadership and partnership".

            <title><![CDATA[BioShock Movie and New Game’s Releases Will Roughly Coincide, Says Movie Producer]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-new-game-releases-will-roughly-coincide/</link>
            <guid>1442551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>BioShock movie adaptation</strong> has been in discussion for a long time. Less than a year after the original game's debut, publisher <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> announced that it had signed a deal with <strong>Universal Studios</strong> for a film that would have been directed by <strong>Gore Verbinski</strong> (The Ring, the first three Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Lone Ranger) and written by <strong>John Logan</strong> (Gladiator, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Skyfall, and Spectre). </p>



<p>The tentative theatrical release window was <strong>2010</strong>, but the project kept being put on hold for various concerns, including budget and the director's insistence on making it R-rated. Eventually, it was cancelled, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-cancelled-weeks-before-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verbinski would reveal years later</a></strong> that it only happened a few weeks before filming was supposed to begin.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to August 2022, and Take-Two <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found new partners for the BioShock movie adaptation</a>: <strong>Netflix</strong> and <strong>Vertigo Entertainment</strong>. This new project has been assigned to <strong>Francis Lawrence</strong>, the director of Constantine, I Am Legend, The Hunger Games, and most recently, The Long Walk. <strong>Michael Green</strong> (Logan, Alien: Covenant, Blade Runner 2049) was originally supposed to write. The BioShock movie is also supposed to have <strong>franchise creator Ken Levine involved in some capacity</strong>, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-has-ken-levine-involved-in-some-capacity-director-explains-what-makes-the-ip-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's what we were told in late 2022</a>.</p>



<p>However, there were delays this time as well. In July 2024, at San Diego Comic-Con, producer <strong>Rory Lee</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-is-still-going-forward-albeit-with-a-reduced-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the project was still alive, but <strong>Netflix had reduced the budget, making it a more personal experience rather than a sprawling epic</strong>. Last year, the film director himself, Francis Lawrence, said progress was finally being made, based on a new screenplay penned by <strong>Justin Rhodes</strong> (Terminator: Dark Fate, Secret Level). </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider has </a><span><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank">received an update from producer Rory Lee</a>, who shared that the project should finally be</span> made once Lawrence is done with the latest The Hunger Games film. Perhaps even more interestingly for gamers, he claims that <strong>Take-Two and Netflix are planning to have the BioShock movie launch coincide with the release of the new game</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it. I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.</em></p>



<p><strong>The next BioShock game also ran into major trouble</strong> throughout its development. First <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in December 2019 to be in the works at <strong>Cloud Chamber</strong>, it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly rebooted several times</a></strong>. In August 2025, it was announced that <strong>Rod Fergusson</strong> (Gears of War, Diablo) <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been brought in as the new studio head</a> to help hone the focus ahead of the game's final stages. </p>



<p>Fergusson has a proven track record of doing exactly that, and indeed the same happened with the last BioShock game released, <strong>2013's Infinite</strong>, with Fergusson hired in 2012 ahead of the game's March 2013 launch. It looks like he'll have more time with the next BioShock, which is now <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be targeting a late 2027 debut</a></strong>. That's two solid years of working on polishing and refining the game.</p>



<p>Of course, the game could always slip. Still, after a long wait on both fronts, it looks like we can expect both the BioShock movie and the BioShock game in 2027-2028, as Take-Two and Netflix hope they'll feed on each other's hype. By the way, old rumors suggested <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-sequel-set-in-antarctica-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game could take place in Antarctica</a></strong>, but who knows if that changed in all these years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="46189111e6777"><a title="Virtual Console" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46189111e6777/virtual-console.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has already ruled out the Game Boy Advance titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> coming to the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' service, so how about the possibility of more Game Boy purchases via the eShop, similar to the Virtual Console releases during the 3DS and Wii U generations.</p>
<p>Well, in case you missed it, this release for Pokémon's 30th anniversary, which is taking place next week on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, is a special occasion. In other words, it doesn't necessarily guarantee more standalone purchases from this era (or from other generations of "classic" Nintendo hardware) going forward, as there are seemingly no plans for "Virtual Console types of offerings".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fgnmush&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Although it's not an outright "no", according to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">official FAQ for the upcoming Pokémon releases</a>, the company insists it remains focused on offering its classic titles through the paid Switch Online + Expansion service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Nintendo:</strong> "</em><em>We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason behind these particular classic game releases being handled "differently" is because the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">apparently thought it would be "fun"</a> to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon like this. To join in on the fun, you'll be required to pay <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> for each title.</p>
<p>Even if Nintendo's comment here was to rule out the return of "Virtual Console types of offerings", other companies such as Hamster Corporation has recently upped retro support with the announcement of its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives collection</a>. This new library from Hamster revives select titles from multiple console generations, and some titles are already available on the eShop.</p>
<p>Nintendo's most recent update to the Switch Online service is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/virtual-boy-for-switch-1-and-2-is-it-really-worth-revisting-nintendos-greatest-folly">launch of the Virtual Boy library</a> earlier this week. To access this particular library of games, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack membership and one of the new accessories (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/can-you-use-labo-vr-goggles-for-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-and-other-nintendo-classics-vb-questions-answered">or try one of the workarounds</a>).</p>

<p>What are your thoughts about this? Is Pokémon just an exception here? Would you like to see more classic games (or at least retro Pokémon titles) follow this model? Could you see Virtual Console-style offerings returning in some way or form one day? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-seemingly-rules-out-virtual-console-revival-says-it-remains-focused-on-offering-classics-via-switch-online]]></content:encoded>

<p>Releasing on Switch next week!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>A week out from Pokémon Day and Pokémon's official 30th anniversary celebrations, Nintendo has officially announced the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> as standalone eShop releases.</p>
<p>The announcement has surprised (and shocked) trainers around the globe in all sorts of ways and if the existing info dump wasn't already enough, the official Pokémon YouTube channel is now sharing additional footage of the returning Game Boy Advance titles.</p>
<p>In this particular video, we're given a side-by-side of the FireRed and LeafGreen opening themes, and how exactly you can expect them to look if you end up purchasing them for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each (or your regional equivalent) on the Switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The excitement of the Kanto region, as well as the charming Pokémon you know and love, are just as you remember them with updated graphics in Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version. The Sevii Islands—not present in Pokémon Red or Pokémon Blue—have also been added, greatly expanding the areas you can explore and the scope of your adventure.

<p>We're fast approaching the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> on the Switch 2, and ahead of what might just be one of the most-anticipated games of 2026, Capcom has issued a special notice to the "Resident Evil community" about spoilers and leaks.</p>
<p>In a message on social media, it asks fans to "please" not "post or share any pre-release leaks and spoilers" of the new entry starring the series' icon Leon S. Kennedy and the FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>Capcom has also mentioned in the same notice how its legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices if required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capcom:</strong> "We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are planning on jumping into this new Resident Evil experience on release, and don't want any spoilers, at least you know now to tread carefully over the coming days. Leaks tied to Requiem's story (and more) are already supposedly circulating on social media, subreddits and elsewhere online.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, and there'll be two amiibo released later this year.</p>

<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma gives her stance on AI. She also firmly believes that human beings are the ones responsible for great stories in gaming.</p>



<p>On February 20, 2026, Xbox underwent a great restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-shares-memo-to-her-team-following-departure-at-xbox/" id="178381">Sarah Bond, former Xbox president</a>, also stepped down. In their place, Asha Sharma has been named new EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-vision-for-xbox-and-the-future-of-microsoft-gaming">Asha Sharma’s Vision for Xbox and the Future of Microsoft Gaming</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma, who was previously the head of CoreAI at Microsoft, commented on her stance on AI in gaming. She admits the industry is in a tumultuous place but remains optimistic and open-minded about the future.</p>



<p>Speaking of the future, while she does have a background in AI, she also has no tolerance for “bad AI.” Furthermore, she also believes in protecting what she believes in. As that pertains to AI, she is cognisant that AI is part of gaming’s future, as it has played a role in its past. Still, she believes humans tell good stories.</p>



<p>“AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new “growth engines,” but that “great stories are created by humans.”</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-review</link>
            <guid>1442464</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not have the same kind of ambition or bells and whistles as its contemporaries, but Styx holds a special place in my heart as one of very few pure stealth game series we have left. Will you find the incredibly creative scenarios of Hitman or the insane level of polish and replayability of Dishonored? Nope. Instead Styx contents itself with simply being a reliable way for stealth fans to get their fix, and Styx: Blades of Greed is no exception. More often than not, the usual playbook of sneaking around, stealing and assassinating everything in sight, is as fun as it’s ever been, and this sequel makes some important tweaks, like removing weak multiplayer mechanics to refocus on a solo stealth experience and swapping smaller, mission-based maps for absolutely massive regions. But it’s also saddled with quite a few of the same issues it’s always had, finicky movement, performance issues, and an unremarkable story, which are as disappointing as they are completely expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor from 2017, Blades of Greed puts you in the leather boots of an elderly, grumpy goblin as you sneak into small spaces, stab humans, elves, and monsters in their soft places, and use an arsenal of gadgets and special abilities to overcome the fact that getting spotted will get you killed in two seconds flat. There are some modest additions, like a couple of new gadgets and abilities that let you do things like mind control NPCs from afar or use a grappling hook to close large gaps in a short period of time, but for the most part there’s very little that’s changed about the moment-to-moment gameplay. You’ll still find, for example, the ol’ reliable ability to turn yourself invisible for a short period of time, and will still find yourself hiding inside closets and barrels before popping out to slit the throat of some idiot guard. Good times. As ever, stealth is absolutely the star of the show, and Blades of Greed has the same high quality sneaking around that you’d hope it would.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Styx: Blades of Greed Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story in Styx has never been very good, and Blades of Greed lives up to those low expectations by having a completely forgettable story in spite of the fact that its protagonist is inherently interesting and unique. After developing a craving for magical abilities granted to you by quartz crystals found throughout the world, you begin a repetitive journey to, well, find more of it, and 90% of the campaign is just going from place-to-place stealing these glowing rocks to power yourself up with little in the way of plot in between those scavenger hunts. You meet some characters along the way, like a gadget-obsessed dwarf and an orc who becomes your spiritual guide, but they don’t get enough screen time to leave much of an impression and what they do get isn’t used effectively, with everyone spouting off explanations of telling you what you need to do next and little else. You’re unlikely to have come to the Styx series looking for an engaging story, but just in case you were hoping to be pleasantly surprised: I wouldn’t count on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the vast majority of Styx’s bones remain the same, one major change is that instead of treading (and sometimes retreading) through mission-specific levels, Blades of Greed lets you loose in three extremely large maps filled with both mandatory and optional areas to explore, pilfer, and fall to your death within. It’s a neat idea that allows for significantly more freedom over prior adventures, and it’s quite easy to become distracted and assassinate your way through an entire region before realizing you didn’t even really have any objective behind any of it, except that it’s just hard to see a guard walking by unaware and not take him down. These huge levels also allow you to express creativity in how you navigate the area and solve the problem of getting around when every 10 feet there’s someone who could kill you by breathing on you. When you’re staring at an objective that’s a mountain’s distance above you, you’ll need to just creep around and try things to figure out how to get there – maybe you’ll find a nice spot on the side of a tower to make daring leaps while avoiding the notice of guards along the way, or maybe you’ll find a quieter path via a sewer system that leads you to the same spot, but is infested with giant bugs that will swarm you if you get too close.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That can be a really interesting stealth challenge to figure out, but comes with some unique drawbacks as well. For one, it can be exhausting to have to cross such a massive area slowly sneaking along all the while, and if you try to just sprint past everything to get to the objective, you should be prepared to reload a whole bunch as you work through the trial and error process of doing so. That travel time feels significantly less focused and curated than the more linear model for level design as well, and oftentimes you’re kinda just half-assedly sneaking through ruins and across rooftops with no real obstacles along the way until you get to the place that the objective marker wants you to be, at which point things start to feel much more focused. In other words, it’s a whole lot of fat before you get to the meat of the main objectives. I actually spent the vast majority of the more than 20 hours it took me to beat Blades of Greed trying to figure out where exactly my next objective was and how to get there, rather than actually pulling off the heist in question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that each of these maps is pretty awesome across the board. The Wall is an absurdly cool vertical labyrinth of concrete castles and rickety slums, Turquoise Dawn is a jungle of trees, swamps, and massive, deadly roaches swarming in dark areas, and the Akenash Ruins are a ruined, kingdom where everything floats in the air unnaturally and enemies are extremely weird monsters, like something out of Elden Ring. Each visit to these places throughout the story unlocks new areas to explore, though you’ll also do quite a bit of backtracking through areas you’ve already been, which is a bit of a drag. Still, these are some of the more interesting areas I’ve stalked the halls of in a stealth game and highlights the unique, strange, and magically-infused world that this curmudgeonly goblin calls home.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Stealth Games</h3><p>If you like to remain unseen, here are the best games for you to see.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Tieguytravis/lists/tieguytravis-favorite-stealth-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the huge amount of space these maps have can be pretty great to explore, they sometimes feel a bit too big for the much smaller objectives within them. The story’s main objectives are much smaller than a typical stealth mission, usually just requiring you to steal a key and open a locked door, or shut down a machine so you can reach your objective – miniature quests that usually only take a couple minutes to complete, if that. Once you’ve checked it off your list, you’re back to the mostly uneventful traveling stealth as you find a way to the next objective, often requiring you to backtrack through some of the same spots in the process, which is how I have spent the bulk of the adventure so far. On the bright side, this format means you’re basically just locked into a constant stream of pure, unadulterated stealth scenarios for hours on end as you work your way through each set of missions, and since that’s Blades of Greed’s strong suit, you’re getting exactly what the doctor ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re familiar with the shortcomings of the previous Styx games, then you’ll probably be less-than-stoked to hear that Blades of Greed doesn’t address most of these. Combat, which is a last resort, but sometimes required, is quite sloppy and overly simplistic, and moving around, especially jumping onto ledges and the like can be finicky at times and caused me to fall to my death or get caught out in the open dozens of times by this point. Worse than those though, are the usual performance issues and technical challenges, like NPCs becoming invisible while talking to them and frames dropping to horrifyingly low levels after extended play sessions. Framerate issues are actually a fair bit worse than I remember them being in previous games, presumably due to the significantly larger maps, and it can get pretty bad for long stretches when there’s a lot happening on screen. Most of these issues are sort of baked into Styx by this point, but it’s still worth shouting out that the bulk of this stuff has mostly gone unaddressed, seemingly.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed offers strong stealth mechanics and some truly awesome maps to explore decorated by the usual jankiness we’ve come to expect from the series. When you’re sneaking through these vast regions, slitting people’s throats and pulling off badass heists, it’s just as rad as ever, and the additional bag of magical tricks offers some new ways to outsmart your pursuers. Those good times are offset by a whole host of drawbacks, from the weak story, the extra fat added from large areas where objectives are miles apart, and performance issues that can be quite annoying. Blades of Greed still makes for a good time and offers a pure stealth experience that’s harder to find these days – you’ll just have to sneak around its rough parts to enjoy it.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-review]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1442461</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are coming to Nintendo Switch next week to celebrate the series 30th anniversary. And while The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-has-a-whole-faq-on-why-its-selling-pokmon-firered-and-leafgreen-separately-for-20-each">answered a number of questions about the releases</a> that probably shouldn't have been necessary to ask to begin with, there's one question we still don't know the answer to: Will these games be compatible with Pokémon Home?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the non-Pokénerds out there, Pokémon Home is a cloud-based, paid subscription service that allows users to store Pokémon from various games, as well as move them between certain compatible games. The service has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-home/Pokemon_HOME_3.0_Update">directly compatible with every new Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch</a>, as well as Pokémon GO, and it also works with Pokémon Bank, a similar program that existed on the 3DS. The explanations and rules are a bit convoluted, but essentially, it's only through Bank and Home that Pokémon from older games such as Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal (in their Virtual Console on Nintendo 3DS incarnations) can be brought forward to modern games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, with some finagling, Pokémon fans can essentially bring a beloved monster from any mainline Pokémon game they've ever played (except the original Game Boy cartridges for Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal) to Pokemon Home and, if it's compatible, transfer it for use into a modern game and continue their adventures. It's been a cool way for collectors to track their PokéDexes, and for long-time fans to keep beloved monsters from their childhoods by their side as adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original FireRed and LeafGreen are compatible with Home in this way too, though the process is, as suggested above, a bit complicated. In order to get Pokemon OUT of FireRed and LeafGreen into Home, you first have to use the Pal Park feature to transfer them to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum using a Nintendo DS system. Then, you have to use the Poke Transfer Lab (which requires two Nintendo DS systems) to move them from that game to Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. From there, you can move them into Pokémon Bank on a Nintendo 3DS, and then from Bank they can be transferred to Home. It's convoluted, but it's possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen on Nintendo Switch are compatible with Home directly, players can skip all that and bring monsters directly from those games into Home without having to own three different DS systems and multiple old game cartridges. However, players are concerned that this may not be the case. Earlier today, when the eShop page went live for FireRed and LeafGreen, it initially included the line, "Support for Pokémon HOME is coming soon. You'll be able to bring the Pokémon you catch and train to the place where all Pokémon gather-support for Pokémon HOME is coming to Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Version!” However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans noticed that line was almost immediately removed</a>, leaving the compatibility up in the air.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/20/screenshot-2026-02-20-134922-1771616985303.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of compatibility would be irritating enough if it was just a matter of convenience, but it's actually possible that Home not being available could cause issues with the gameplay itself. FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of the original Pokemon games Red and Green. Players are thus able to complete the "Kanto" PokéDex just by playing them and trading a few monsters back and forth with a friend who has the other version of the game. Though <em>online</em> features are apparently not available in these Switch ports (even though they were in the 3DS ports of Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal!), <em>local</em> trading is, so that's not the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What <em>is</em> the problem is the National Dex. In FireRed/LeafGreen, the "National Dex" was, at the time, the "full" Pokedex, containing all 151 original Pokemon as well as all new Pokemon added in the second generation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-gold-silver-crystal-version/List_of_Gen_2_Pokemon_(Johto_Pokedex)">Gold/Silver/Crystal</a>) and third (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Pokedex">Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a>). The National Dex unlocks in FireRed/LeafGreen's post-game, and with it comes the ability to catch many of these Pokémon in the wild in-game. However, not every Pokémon is available. The Johto and Hoenn starter Pokémon, legendaries like Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi, and dozens of others were only obtainable back in the day by trading from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, or XD. And none of those games are currently available on Nintendo Switch in a way that would be locally compatible for trade with FireRed/LeafGreen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which means that, upon release, FireRed/LeafGreen will not be completeable, at least not in the 100% sense, because the National Dex will be impossible to fill out. While that probably won't bother most casual players, it's a pretty notable oversight, especially given that the releases of other classic games on Virtual Console on 3DS seemed so well thought-out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible this is a lot of hullabaloo over nothing. Maybe the games<em> are </em>compatible with Home and Nintendo was just cleaning up language on the eShop page a bit. Maybe Home compatibility is coming in a few weeks or months, and Nintendo didn't want to set expectations too early. Maybe we're about to get an announcement of Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald on Nintendo Switch Online next week, and they'll be compatible locally. Maybe Colosseum and XD are coming to Switch Online (Nintendo has already teased them!), though these two games alone wouldn't canvas all the missing Pokemon. Maybe there's some other explanation! But it's weird that given Nintendo's extensive FAQ, they didn't address this glaring issue specifically. IGN reached out to both Nintendo and The Pokémon Company today to try and find out what the deal was. The Pokemon Company declined to comment, and we didn't hear back from Nintendo in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if neither company Koffings up an answer soon, we'll know more next week when the games actually launch and as the dust settles from Pokémon Day and all its announcements. Regardless, the rollout of FireRed and LeafGreen on Switch has been <em>real weird</em>, especially in light of past efforts to preserve classic Pokémon games. Only Nintendo and The Pokémon Company knows why they don't just dump all these things on Switch Online and make the people happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Sarah Bond resigned from Xbox amid a restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. Bond shared her full memo to her Xbox team on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“Hi team,</p>



<p>I know there’s a lot of news to take in today.</p>



<p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we’ve helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world.</p>



<p>When we announced our intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022, I committed to helping lead Xbox through what would be a critical period of change. Over the past four years, we’ve navigated that moment together and positioned the business for what comes next. We took on some of the biggest challenges this organization has ever faced and did it as one team.</p>



<p>With that, I’ve decided this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally. We’re living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I’m energized by what’s ahead. This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter. I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand. She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I’m excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team. I’ll remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition and set the organization up for continued success.</p>



<p>I want to thank Phil for his mentorship and friendship over the years. He’s been a consistent champion of this business and the people who make it what it is, and I’ve learned a great deal from the way he leads through both opportunity and challenge. I’m grateful for his trust and support throughout my time on the team. I also want to thank Satya for his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft.</p>



<p>As I prepare to sign off, I’ve been reflecting on three simple questions I’ve tried to use to guide my days:</p>



<p>Did I bring my best?<br>Did I help someone else succeed?<br>Did I do my best work?</p>



<p>I hope the answer has been yes for many of you. It’s been a privilege to work alongside this team.</p>



<p>Always,<br>Sarah”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Microsoft Executive Vice President for Gaming Phil Spencer announced he will retire after 38 years at Microsoft and 12 years leading the company’s video game efforts. Asha Sharma, an executive currently in charge of Microsoft’s CoreAI division, will take his place.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond, who many assumed was being groomed as Spencer’s eventual replacement, is also resigning from the company. Current Xbox Studios Head Matt Booty, meanwhile, is being promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer and will work closely with Sharma.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">his departure note</a>, Spencer said he told Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last fall that he was “thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.” Spencer will remain at Microsoft “in an advisory role” through the summer to help Sharma during the transition, he wrote.</p>
<p>Spencer, who got his start at Microsoft as an intern in 1988, served as a manager and executive at Microsoft Game Studios in 2003. In 2014, he took over as Head of Xbox, guiding the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/05/head-of-xbox-says-plans-to-decouple-kinect-from-xbox-one-began-in-april/">through the aftermath</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/spencer-microsoft-almost-abandoned-xbox-brand-after-the-xbox-one-launch/">the troubled, Kinect-bundled launch of the Xbox One</a>. More recently, he helped shepherd the company’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/microsoft-purchases-bethesda-softworks-in-industry-changing-acquisition/">2020 purchase of Bethesda Softworks</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/microsoft-set-to-purchase-activision-blizzard-in-68-7-billion-deal/">its $68.7 billion merger with Activision Blizzard</a>, including the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/ftc-xbox-exclusive-starfield-is-powerful-evidence-against-activision-deal/">many</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/microsoft-fights-to-save-activision-merger-says-sony-protest-is-self-serving/">regulatory</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/uk-regulators-come-down-hard-against-microsofts-activision-acquisition/">battles</a> that followed that latter announcement.</p>
<h2>Meet the new boss</h2>
<p>Sharma, who joined Microsoft just two years ago after stints at Meta and Instacart, promised in an introductory message to preside over “the return of Xbox,” and a “recommit[ment] to our core fans and players.” That commitment would “start with console which has shaped who we are,” but expand “across PC, mobile, and cloud,” Sharma wrote.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major shakeup is taking place at the top of Microsoft’s gaming business, as long-time Xbox and Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer is retiring, effective from Monday 23rd February, with current President of Microsoft’s CoreAI, Asha Sharma is set to take over as the new CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>
<p>Xbox President Sarah Bond, who was easy to view as Spencer’s eventual successor, has resigned, while Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty is being promoted to Chief Content Officer.</p>


<p>Messages from all (except Bond) have been <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/">published by Microsoft</a>. Spencer said that he had been thinking about retiring for a little while, and that this handover has seen him work with his successor for several months now.</p>
<p>“Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team. Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.”</p>

<p data-cy="paragraph">Sharma might not have been the most obvious choice from the outside, and coming from an AI background will certainly be a cause for concern to many gamers, where generative AI is viewed very negatively.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it. That starts with three commitments. First, great games. Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most. I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, the return of Xbox. We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world. We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“Third, future of play. We are witnessing the reinvention of play. To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">There’s definitely some reassuring sentiments within that, though I would argue that saying your first job is to understand what’s going on makes this sound more of a hurried appointment. We will have to see how much institutional change follows.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">Phil Spencer had been at the helm of Microsoft’s gaming efforts for over a decade, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/31/phil-spencer-fills-the-spot-of-head-of-xbox-at-microsoft/">taking over in 2014</a> and setting about steading the suddenly floundering console gaming business. He moved quickly to cut the price of the Xbox One by removing the Kinect from the bundle, made gamer-positive moves like championing backwards compatibility, and enacted major changes to the Xbox business model by promising day-and-date PC releases for Xbox games (and releasing them on Steam), as well as introducing Xbox Game Pass. He also saw Xbox exclusives start to come to PlayStation, breaking down traditional barriers.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">However, he’s also been at the helm more recent difficult times for the brand. The Xbox Series X|S launch did not go as successfully as planned, not least with significant game delays for the likes of Halo Infinite, studio acquisitions took a long time to bear fruit, Xbox Game Pass started to see market saturation, and then successive price increases to both consoles and services.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">With an eye to the future, now might be the best time for him to step aside, but Xbox as a brand feels somewhat nebulous right now. There’s a lot of rumours about what their next console might be like, whether it’s more PC-like than console and with rival storefronts, or traditional. Microsoft will inevitably be very keen to see AI used in some fashion, having demoed AI helpers with Minecraft in recent years (and that was before the current madness). But with a new CEO all of that could change. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[That’s It, I’m Calling It, Xbox Is Dead, Time Of Death February 20]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114</link>
            <guid>1442422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you read <em>Kotaku</em> even semi-regularly, you already know that Xbox has been in a weird spot for some time now. And with today’s news that both <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">Xbox boss Phil Spencer and President Sarah Bond are leaving</a> and the new head of the brand will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">a former Meta exec who previously lead Microsoft’s AI division</a>, I think it’s time to call it. Xbox is dead. Time of death: February 20, 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-earnings-q2-game-pass-hardware-next-gen-pc-2000663911">This death is far from sudden or surprising</a>. If anything, we’ve all seen it coming for a while now. Reading the news about Xbox often felt like checking in on someone battling a terminal disease and whose fight wasn’t going well. Looking at the endless layoffs, impossible demands from leadership, canceled projects, flops, games getting ported to PlayStation, and loads of mismanagement, it seemed clear that in recent years, Xbox wasn’t doing well.</p>

 <h2>The beginning of the end</h2> <p>If I had to pick the moment when things truly got bad, it would be when <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-xbox-merger-timeline-call-of-duty-1850108022">Xbox bought Activision Blizzard</a>. After spending $70 billion and enduring years of legal challenges to its efforts to buy the <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> publisher, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-finally-completes-activision-blizzard-deal-1850924662">Xbox finally pulled it off in 2023.</a> But suddenly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Xbox found itself under much more pressure to deliver</a>. Xbox was no longer just a console created by Microsoft as a small side hustle; instead it had morphed into a massive publisher with a huge suite of studios, franchises, and employees to manage. Over the next two years, everything started to change at Xbox.</p> <p>The company began de-emphasizing the idea that you even needed to own an Xbox to play Xbox games. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox, remember?</a> Want to play <em>Halo</em> or <em>Gears of War</em> but don’t own an Xbox? Don’t worry, the games are launching on PC. Don’t want to play on PC? It’s fine, you can stream them via your phone or TV. You don’t even have to buy the games, just pay for this monthly subscription. When a console brand stops trying to sell consoles, you can probably stick a fork in it.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">We here at <em>Kotaku</em> called the end of the console war around this time.</a> But we didn’t call the death of the Xbox just then. That’s because, despite all the signs, there was always that chance that Phil Spencer would right the ship again, as he had done before, and keep Xbox alive.</p>

 <h2>AI and porting <em>Halo</em></h2> <p>And then Microsoft, like all big tech giants these days, began investing even more billions of dollars into AI. And here was Xbox, a pricey side project that never made the company much money, but was costing the company a ton on massive deals to buy Bethesda and Activision. That was cash that could be spent on datacenters and Copilot, damn it!</p> <p>This is around the time that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">Microsoft began trying to shove AI into Xbox</a> in a very awkward fashion, one that felt removed from Spencer’s stewardship of the brand. In 2025, after already porting some of its smaller games, like <em>Sea of Thieves </em>and <em>Grounded</em>, to PlayStation and Switch, Xbox did the unthinkable. <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">It announced plans to bring <em>Halo</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, yet one more big sign that it was all over. Spencer would never promote this news on social media.</p>

 <p>That brings us to today. Xbox will no longer be run by a “gamer.” Instead, Asha Sharma, an AI executive who previously worked at Meta and InstaCart and who has no video game industry experience at all, has been put in charge of the brand despite another person, Sarah Bond, being seemingly the perfect successor to Spencer. Sharma’s hiring has generated a lot of speculation, with some theorizing that she’s a temp pick until Microsoft completely devours Xbox and turns it into nothing more than an icon on your desktop that you never click. Others have suggested she’s been put in place to help bring AI to Xbox in a big way, which seems very likely, too.</p> <p>Regardless of why she’s been made the new Xbox boss, it is now very clear: Xbox is dead. The corpse will linger around for a bit longer, but the odds of a new Xbox console hitting shelves are low. I suspect all future hardware will be rebranded PCs, like the ROG Ally X handheld from last year. A slow death for a console that once was huge, but was sunk by tech executives who had no idea what they were doing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-no-aggression-matchmaking/</link>
            <guid>1442419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought you were tricking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> into sorting you into PvE-focused lobbies, you’re mistaken. It has been confirmed directly from the source at Embark Studios that the popular extraction adventure game <strong>does not do that</strong>. It’s just a coincidence that you’re being filed in with players who want a more peaceful time of things.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios’</a> design director, Virgil Watkins, confirmed that Aggression-Based Matchmaking (or ABMM, to keep it simple) is <strong>not a thing </strong>in ARC Raiders. It’s not binary, and you don’t get <strong>either </strong>friendly or violent lobbies when you explore the world outside Speranza.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-doesn-t-have-friendly-lobbies">ARC Raiders Doesn’t Have Friendly Lobbies</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-full-interview-nobody-whatsoever-thought-wed-have-this-many-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer interview</a> with Embark Studios, it was <strong>confirmed </strong>in clear terms that ARC Raiders <strong>does not </strong>use Aggression-Based Matchmaking to funnel players into their matches.</p>



<p>This was confirmed by Virgil Watkins, the outspoken Embark developer who has been a fountain of knowledge of late:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t coin the term aggression-based matchmaking.</p>



<p>It’s not nearly as binary as people think. There’s no such thing as a friendly lobby or an aggressive lobby; the system is still mixing everybody, and everything’s down to human motivation. Just because you’re tending toward the more peaceful end doesn’t remove the autonomy from other people making a choice about wanting your stuff.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Watkins’ terms, it might <em>feel </em>binary, but it’s not. You can’t shoot raiders and magically be put into a more PvP-focused lobby in the next round. He stressed it’s more <strong>nuanced</strong> than that, and what’s more, it’s constantly being evolved as the game matures. The team <strong>has </strong>noticed that players ‘have more fun’ in safer lobbies, but they’re not forcing it either way.</p>



<p>Later, Watkins stressed that it’s always up to the player how violent their lobbies are. It was pointed out that nobody is forcing you to shoot other players; that’s entirely up to you. He explained how certain groups of players will always feel more motivated to engage other players, but that’s their prerogative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we just have to primarily make sure that the PvP side of the game is as fair as we can make it.</p>



<p>We still have the mantra—and this is even regardless of the formation of this PvE-heavy audience—that the game never asks you to fight other players. That’s entirely your own decision. So you’re always going to have people who have the motivation to fight, because there are people who just like PvP. </p>



<p>I think we need to keep making sure we’re providing them with the tools and means to do that in an engaging way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also made very clear that the end-of-round surveys that players are prompted to resolve do <strong>not </strong>have a bearing on matchmaking. If you were killed in a brutal bout of PvP and say that you hated the combat in that round, you won’t then be placed in a quieter, safer lobby the next go-around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Those are just to help us gauge how players felt about the round. They have no mechanical change on what happens to you. It is solely based on your actions in the round. Those just go to our data team and help us pair up like things that occurred in the server.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Do you feel like Embark Studios is being as up front as possible about ABMM in ARC Raiders, or do you still suspect it plays a major role in matchmaking? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

      <p>You may not have noticed, but we’re pretty fed up with the cash-ravenous marketing scheme otherwise known as generative AI around these parts. We – like so many others – are sick of being exploited and tired of the computer getting more expensive. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, we rant about that for <em>even more</em> than an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we find ourselves tangled in a rat king of interrelated AI stories: leftists apparently hate technology because they’re rejecting AI (and <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><u>the mass exploitation that comes with it</u></a>), the computer – a theoretically magical device hijacked by tech industry perverts – has <a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><u>become massively more expensive</u></a> as a result of AI, and a former indie games luminary has <a href="https://x.com/jasonrohrer/status/2022738409119461680?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dived into the deep end of AI psychosis</u></a> and given agents free rein to blow nearly $10,000 on the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping in mind that AI is nothing but stringing together sentences by predicting words at mass scale, we maintain a theme by moving along to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/"><u>prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi</u></a>, which also had a big week with the former <a href="https://www.avclub.com/substack-polymarket-expanded-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing Substack integration</u></a>. How is “data” that arises from what is functionally just gambling useful to writers, news organizations, or anyone? <a href="https://aftermath.site/journalism-prediction-markets/"><u>Beats us</u></a>! But here we are. Finally, we answer an all-timer of a mailbag question: “How many owls would you have to see in a day before you thought something weird was going on?”&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create our own prediction market where CNN pays the five of us to each flip a coin, and then gives us one million dollars.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Every part of the computer [is being affected by AI], and it’s just a bar full of guys that are doing this – that are ruining the computer. I love the computer. I love the computer so much. I love the computer with all my heart. I love technology. Somebody described me as a technologist the other day, and I had never thought of calling myself that, but it is true: I love technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that makes me saddest about this is that we are constantly made to hate the thing that many of us love, which is the computer. Because it either does evil things – which, fair, it’s technology; technology is often morally neutral to evil sometimes – but also because now we can’t even have it. The end of the personal computer, they want this now all in the cloud. They want you to rent their server space. It’s the enclosure of the commons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This also all raises the larger philosophical question that’s kind of answered by the powers that be that are propagating AI, which is: Who wants to surrender control to the cloud or AI agents or whatever? That’s not a thing that humans typically do well or that we enjoy. But then the question becomes: <em>Who </em>wants you to surrender control and why? AI is part of a larger push, under fascism, to make us more willing to just go along with whatever. It’s like “Oh, there’s always gonna be a degree of unpredictability or variability in AI agents handling stuff for us; look at how convenient it is.”&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, people in charge basically say “There’s always gonna be a degree of friction or strain under Dear Leader, but that’s fine; it’s the price of whatever good thing we’re collectively getting.” All of these are interrelated ideas that complement each other and, again, lead to the erosion of freedom and control in your own life – and being OK with that, at least philosophically.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But even within that framework, it doesn’t make sense. I think that gives them too much credit, because even phones aren’t going to be affordable. How are you gonna talk to their chatbots? The thing you need to talk to the chatbot needs RAM. They are now hoarding the RAM.&nbsp;</p><p>This sucks for everybody, but it also sucks for me personally. It makes me mad, because none of them want to talk about the fact that the computer’s fucking expensive now. … It’s all just five guys being annoying, like “Isn’t this great? Isn’t this fucking great?” No! Leave me alone, you fucking freak. I don’t care! But I have to care because that’s my job. I have to care because it’s something I love. I have to care because the computer means more to me than it ever will to these fucking people – any of them! They do not love the computer. They do not have love of the computer in their heart. They love the shape of the computer, they love selling the computer. They don’t fucking like being on the computer. They don’t like getting a computer to do things. They don’t like enjoying struggling with the computer and then having it pay off.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a thing I feel in my heart. It makes me so fucking mad, and I hate these people so much for insisting that I should be fucking excited for this. Because they have ruined a thing I like; they have made a thing I love hard to get, and I cannot stand that. None of them want to talk about that. None of them want to face that because they are either too stupid, too sold on this, or they’re looking at their Vanguard portfolio. And honestly I cannot stand that. Go away. Leave me alone. I want everything you do to crash.&nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/"><div><p>The Left Doesn’t Hate Technology, We Hate Being Exploited</p><p>Techno-cynics are all just wounded techno-optimists.</p><p><span>Gita Jackson</span></p></div></a></figure><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ram-prices-hdd-prices-ai-bubble-computer-expensive/"><div><p>I’m Tired Of These Useless Jackasses Making The Computer Expensive</p><p>RAM, flash memory, and HDDs are unaffordable because of a bunch of greedy idiots that do not love the computer.</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Chris Person</span></p></div></a></figure>
