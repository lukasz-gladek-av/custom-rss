            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes finding the correct box set for your Strike Team in Star Wars: Shatterpoint can be hard. But don't worry because we have you covered on that front, with a series of expansions that you should be keeping your eyes on to help you dominate the galaxy (or table). I just r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-elegant-weapon-for-more-civilized-0" rel="nofollow">eviewed some newer releases from the line</a>, and now Asmodee USA sent me review copies of all the expansions mentioned below, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>Plans And Preparations</h2>

<p>Admittedly, one of the main reasons that lured me towards this box was that it had Clone Commandos attached. This more or less worked in my favor because one of the main factions I'm trying to stick with is the Galactic Republic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=GproN-PH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=Z501NKsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of plans.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the keywords for the characters in this unit buff other Galactic Republic/Jedi characters. If you already have the Hello There or This Party's Over box, you can easily pair them together for real damage. If you want to get creative with it, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli works well with virtually anyone in the Galactic Republic without trying too hard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=Ndmh7iA0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=hcRH5bkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of preparation.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the thing I appreciated about this set was how dynamic the Clone minis were. They're posed extremely well, and one even comes with some slight cover to help make it feel more alive. Little details like that really help bring the whole set together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=ipzF1Nkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=fVgUdLpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Best boys.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches of Dathomir</h2>

<p>The Witches of Dathomir is a really interesting one, because they don't have a lot of synergy with many other troops, and the only one with the Separatist Alliance keyword is Savage Orpress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=zzAmPxMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=gX7TzRrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just in time for spooky season.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, it's not all doom and gloom because everyone in this set does share the Force User keyword, so you can pair them up with others who buff characters with the same trait. With all of that said, though, I still couldn't think of a more fun unit to play. Mother Talzin has a lot of incredible abilities that buff other characters with the Dathomiran keyword, one of which allows them to heal right after a character has been injured. While Savage Opress is about getting up close and personal, the Nightsister Acolytes can support from afar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=dRXPipsV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=yXPbSZu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get this guy up close for some serious damage.</figcaption></figure><p>This set, in particular, caters to many different play styles while encouraging you to try something new. Even if you're not entirely sold on them, each character in this unit can pack a serious punch in combat, and they are all some of the best models in the game. And I had the most fun when it came to painting these.</p>



<p>If I'm being perfectly honest, I had no business getting this set at all. The reason why I got this was 100% based on the rule of cool. Because if having a squad full of Ewoks fighting Vader and friends doesn't sound like a good time, I don't know what does.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=9jWTjk75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=AGudJd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Yubs.</figcaption></figure><p>What's unique about this set is that it comes with five models, but the trade-off is that each doesn't have a lot of health, so you have to be smart about how you use them. Thankfully, each character in this team is stacked to the brim with all sorts of abilities, and it does a great job at capturing the guerilla warfare vibes we see them do in the film.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=rqBk4szT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=fodno0Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Nubs.</figcaption></figure><p>To make things even better, they have a Battle Tactic card centered on trapping your opponent in one way or another. The only downside to this squad is that most of the synergy is based around other Ewoks, so if you pair them up with anything else, you won't get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>

<h2>High Ground Terrain Pack</h2>

<p>Terrain is one of those things that you can never have too much of, and the High Ground is a perfect addition for any game. As the name suggests, it offers a lot of elevated areas for your strike team to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=MRfUKqdV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=_EvrtvZJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They said the thing!</figcaption></figure><p>The one thing I especially enjoy about this set is the four bridges it comes with, because it adds an extra layer to a fight when the objective marker is right below you. The great thing with Shatterpoint Terrain is that each pack can be perfectly paired with the other. They all fit together more or less like a puzzle piece, so you never really have to worry about one set being out of place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=r0fpMagl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=XxQDRpV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is great for having a lot of elevated fights.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully, this tiny list made things a bit easier for you when deciding what to purchase in Star Wars: Shatterpoint. Many of these units can be used in various ways and offer unique play styles that encourage you to try new things. As I previously said, you can never go wrong with terrain because each offers something unique that adds flavor to the fight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves it when someone inevitably breaks out <i>Catan</i> at a party. And by everybody, I mean those who love getting locked into a board game that’ll take you about four hours to figure out how to best trade some supplies to expand your settlements. Joking aside, <i>Catan</i> can be a good time. But can it make for good TV? Netflix sure thinks so. It just acquired the rights to adapt it for the streaming screen.</p> <p>Announced via <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/catan-board-game-netflix-adaptations">a post on <i>Tudum</i></a>, Netflix is gearing up to bring the 1995 tabletop game centered on the thrills of bartering and colonizing to film and TV via a partnership with tabletop publisher Asmodee. The streaming service isn’t just investing in a single project, but rather “a slate of scripted and unscripted projects inspired by the hit board game.” On the partnership Jinny Howe, the head of scripted series at Netflix US and Canada, said:</p> <blockquote><p>We knew landing this deal would be as game-changing as a well-placed settlement, so we decided to pool our resources across series, features, animation, and games and show Asmodee the full power of Netflix when we work together. Hardcore “Settlers” are going to lose their minds, and new fans will finally learn just how important a sheep trade can be.</p></blockquote> <p>Honestly, if they just make a fancy animated manual for the board game, I’ll be happy. And I do mean that, as someone for whom it takes at least several rounds of a board game before the rules really click in my head. And this game has so many damn pieces and cards and rules. Ugh. Make it simple for me, Netflix. I’ll also take a <i>Catan</i>-based cottage core lesbian romance centered around some sheep farmers and their Australian Shepherd named Pepper. Assuming such a thing isn’t illegal to make anymore, that is.</p>

                <p>If you're familiar with the legendary Ninja Gaiden series you'll know that it is known for high-octane, jaw-dropping action and superhuman feats of strength and agility. While those are executed in-game by trained ninjas, in the real world there are precious few that can manage feats as impressive. One of those that can, however, is Emmanuel "Master" Rodrigues, a professional gamer that is capable of playing games at the highest level under extreme conditions.</p><p>To celebrate the launch of Ninja Gaiden 4, a brand-new entry in the iconic franchise developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, we took the action to the skies by playing the game on a helicopter soaring over Miami. And to make things even trickier, the 20-foot screen Master is playing on is also flying over city. Needless to say, it takes some serious skill to pull something like that off, let alone do it as well as he does.

have escaped toxic floodwaters by building skyscraper districts that tower above the ruined city below. The stunt was achieved using advanced sports broadcasting technology that was utilized to stream live gameplay from Emmanuel's helicopter to flying screen.</p><p>The stunt also represents the same precision, skill, and pushing limits that is required from Ninja Gaiden 4's two protagonists, Yakumo and Ryu Hayabusa. Ninja Gaiden 4 launches October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Xbox Play Anywhere. It is also also available on Steam and PlayStation 5. Those that have Game Pass can also play it there.</p><p>The Deluxe Edition of Ninja Gaiden 4 includes future gameplay content "The Two Masters," along with additional character skins, weapon skins, and in-game items.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/the-outlast-trials-pvp-invasion-mode-is-out-now-just-in-time-for-halloween/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outlast-trials-pvp-invasion-mode-is-out-now-just-in-time-for-halloween.1330765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p dir="ltr">The Outlast Trials has a new game mode, with the addition of Invasion in today’s update. This permanent new game mode brings PvP to the multiplayer horror game for the first time, arriving alongside the return of the time-limited Program Geister catalogue of outfits for Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outlast Trials | Geister Limited-Time Event &amp; Invasion Update Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCCMkEwIsGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Invasion Mode allows players to either play as Reagents or invade games as an Imposter. Only a limited set of Imposters can invade a particular trial, appearing as a knife wielding maniac, but those waiting be the eyes and ears for their teammate until it’s their turn. While observing, they can ping targets and help strategise, keeping the active Imposters informed. Those Imposters will appear armed with a knife, in either a Slash or Stab variety, with the former dealing damage and the latter needing to charge up for an instant kill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An Imposter only has a limited time to take down a target, being forced to head back to the nearest Insertion Gate or be electrocuted for being naughty, naughty players. They can also punished with death, which leads to a time penalty for their next spawn. They do have some key advantages, being able to see the noise made by Reagents, as well as being immune to psychosis gas and Prime Asset effects, though they won’t be able to pick up items.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of a match, Imposters will be evaluated for inflicting damage, slaying Reagents, and managing to survive their turn.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It’s all a rather interesting twist on the typical asymmetrical horror multiplayer game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, there’s two new MK Challenges:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Beguile the Children</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The television screen is the retina of the mind’s eye, where anything is true and everything is possible, especially when the audience cannot see the tools that are shaping their mind. Take control of the broadcast, reshape the subliminal message, and we will let you out.</em></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" role="presentation">Investigate the Minotaur</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Corporate power and dynastic wealth are the cornerstone of free societies, but only so long as extracurricular activities can be kept quiet. Once private hobbies become public scandals, the guilty must be exposed and destroyed so more tedious dynasties can be put in place. Find the evidence of the Buffalo Minotaur’s crimes, bring it to the press, and we will let you out.</em></p>

<p dir="ltr">And the Geister limited time event is on for Halloween, earning you tokens for completing Trials and Geister Tasks, will suffering through Geister Variators. The event runs from today through to 18th November, with even tokens earned unlocking exclusive cosmetics. Spend ’em while you have ’em!</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a> reveals that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">following the price hike</a> of Xbox Series X/S consoles in the US (the second one in the US in 2025), <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">raising the price of Xbox Game Pass</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">release of a very expensive Xbox-branded, ASUS-made handheld</a>, it's not just the average Xbox fan and consumer who's paying more for Xbox and Xbox-branded hardware. Game developers also have to pay more now for Xbox development kits.</p>



<p>Sources speaking to The Verge claim that the price for an Xbox development kit has jumped 33%, from its old $1,500 price tag to its new <strong>$2,000 USD</strong> price tag. Just like when Microsoft announced the price hike for Series X/S consoles, the increase "<em>reflects macroeconomic developments</em>." However, unlike the recent price increase in the US for the Series X/S, this price hike goes for anyone across the globe looking to grab a development kit.</p>



<p>It's worth noting here that development kit versions of consoles are inherently far more expensive than their consumer-facing counterparts. They come loaded with additional hardware and power that's designed to make them capable of testing various unfinished and unoptimized versions of games, and that's before even getting to the different suite of software options available to developers when they plug their games into these development kits to test them for a commercial release.</p>



<p>That's all to say that the initial $1,500 price tag is definitely expensive, but it's not out of the question that a development kit costs at least four figures to acquire. It's also worth noting that the price of development kits is often a difficult thing to pin down, since that's usually the sort of detail only shared under NDAs between game developers and manufacturers like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.</p>



<p>What's notable about this price increase is that it comes at a time when Microsoft has decidedly shirked off any notion that it is the home of 'the best deal in gaming' anymore and is now 'the most expensive deal in gaming' between the cost of an Xbox console and its premium subscription service, along with the fact that, just like the price increase of the Series X/S consoles, the price of development kits seems to be going up, at least in part, due to tariffs implemented by the current United States administration.</p>



<p>Despite several major successes, the video game industry, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/50-of-games-industry-layoffs-have-taken-place-in-california">particularly in the United States</a>, has remained in dire straits for the last few years. Raising the barrier to entry for developers who are potentially looking to put their games on Xbox makes it feel like Microsoft is trying to catch flies with vinegar rather than honey. Why would a studio that's already concerned about making the money they spend on making their game back go with a platform that has made it more expensive to be a part of from the jump?</p>



<p>Even considering that you can technically turn any Series X/S console you buy into a development kit by digging into the settings and paying a fee to Microsoft to get it up and running properly, due to the significant hardware limitations between what you get in a Series X versus the development kit, that's likely not an option for many developers. Of course, it all depends on the kind of game you're making, but the point stands that just using consumer-grade Series consoles is not a solid solution to getting around this price hike.</p>



<p>At least it lines up with what seems to be Microsoft's new approach to make Xbox the most expensive deal in gaming, whether you're playing the games, or making them.</p>

			<p>Today, developer Free Range Games and publisher North Beach Games announced the launch date of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-durins-folk-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a> for the survival game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.</p>



<p>This first expansion will be released on November 18 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. According to the developers, it will expand the game with more than 20 hours of added content (plus repeatable cooperative events set in randomized dungeons).</p>



<p>Durin's Folk will introduce new endgame content, including an additional story chapter rich with expanded lore, mysterious and challenging areas beyond the mountain’s caverns, thoughtful new gameplay mechanics, and more. </p>



<p>Players will now be able to rescue and recruit NPCs (non-player characters) meet in the mines of Moria, and these recruits will join your settlement and assume useful roles like blacksmith, miner, brewmaster, and guard. Over time, players may even build great works called Monuments with help from the aforementioned NPCs. Through the story, they will uncover the mystery of Durin's Tower, explore the area outside the mountain for the first time, and build massive bases in the large new play area. New materials, items, and recipes will provide more stuff to craft for the dwarven player characters. Lastly, Durin's Folk randomized endgame expeditions that players can repeatedly dive into to get juicy loot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been four years since </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536">Psychonauts 2</a>, </span></i><span>the last new Double Fine game. The studio’s off-kilter sensibilities have always appealed to me, and they’ve helped it create some really great and memorable games, so I was excited to finally have a new release from them in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. And while this unusual adventure about a lighthouse and a bird is shorter than I expected, what is here is a gorgeous, well-crafted, and incredibly creative game that pulls off an emotional story without a single word.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, out now on Xbox and PC, is the first Double Fine game to be completely developed and released since the studio was bought by Xbox. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067">And if you were worried that acquisition</a> would mean that Double Fine might no longer be free to get weird, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>will quickly assuage your fears. This is a game that, at least at the start, revolves around a sentient, walking lighthouse that befriends a cartoon bird, and the two of them embark on a long journey through a post-apocalyptic world devoid of humanity, but full of colorful and bizarre plants and critters.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Weird stuff, right? But while </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is an odd game, it ain’t an ugly one. This might be Double Fine’s best-looking game, with a wide color palette and a sometimes surreal and abstract art style that lives between hand-drawn and sculpted. Over the course of the game’s three- to four-hour runtime, I was always excited to see what the next area would look like, and…oh yeah, uhh, the game is very short.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s no getting around that fact. This is a $30 video game that most people will complete in just about three hours. There aren’t many puzzles, and few of them really pushed me to think all that much. There’s also no combat or skill trees. </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>isn’t a mechanically deep game or a complicated thing to play. Instead, Double Fine wants you to just vibe out with it for like three hours. Enjoy all the pretty colors, the weird shit, and hopefully, by the end, feel something.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And to </span><i><span>Keeper’s </span></i><span>credit, by the time credits rolled, I did indeed feel something. It’s wild to think that a story about a lighthouse and a bird with no dialogue could make me tear up a bit at the very end, but that’s exactly what happened. I didn’t expect it, but the conclusion was a wonderful way to end this epic journey.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“You’ll never look at lighthouses the same way again.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Double Fine</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Single-player adventure game with some puzzles and lots of vibes.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous art, wonderful music, perfect ending, not too long, very creative.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>A few performance hiccups, might be too short for some, lacks memorable puzzles.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S (played), PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>October 17, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Just over three hours and finished the game.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>In fact, I really didn’t expect most of what happens in </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>. You’ve seen trailers for the game and likely assume it’s one thing, and it is that for a while. But similar to EA’s </span><i><span>Split Fiction, Keeper</span></i><span> is a game that relishes in throwing curveballs at you. Every 30 minutes or so, Double Fine’s latest adventure zigs or zags in unexpected ways, and by the end, I was shocked that the game I was playing was the same one I’d started playing a few hours before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You may have noticed that I haven’t gone into detail about the specifics that make </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>so surprising, and that’s because, well, I don’t want to ruin any of the surprise. If you intend to play </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, I urge you to avoid videos of it and just hop in. You can easily knock this thing out in a single sitting, and despite a few performance hiccups, I did that and had a great experience. These are the kinds of games I want Xbox to fill Game Pass with, not new </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> titles that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">make the service more expensive</a> and fill up my hard drive with 4k textures of assault rifles. Give me more silly, strange, and heartfelt experiences that I can finish in a single sitting.</span></p> <p><span>If you were concerned about how Xbox’s ownership of the Double Fine might change it, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>is here to remind us all that the former indie studio is still doing its own thing. And while I don’t have insight into the daily operations of Double Fine or what’s happening behind the scenes, </span><i><span>Keeper </span></i><span>seems to indicate that even under Xbox, the studio behind</span><i><span> Brutal Legend</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Costume Ques</span></i><span>t will continue to make weird games filled with heart and not designed to maximize sales. And that fact, like </span><i><span>Keeper</span></i><span>, makes me really, really happy. </span></p>

This includes one of the most requested changes from the beta, which makes adjustments to the game's movement and the Dexterity perk.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest Dev Talk video featured Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce, who discussed the community complaints about the Dexterity perk. Black Ops 7 initially removed the ability to aim down sights with weapons while diving and sliding, and players needed to equip the Dexterity perk to get the same fluid movement offered in Black Ops 6. Scronce announced that player feedback was considered, and Dexterity will no longer be needed to ADS while sliding or diving. Players can still equip the perk to speed up those specific actions, but it's no longer required to perform the movement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We've got some BIG updates to MP coming out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> Beta in our latest Dev Talk:<br>✅ ADS &amp; Dexterity changes<br>✅ Aim assist adjustments<br>✅ Louder footsteps<br>✅ New slide tuning<br>✅ Perk distribution updates<br>✅ New Perk combinations<br>✅ Faster mantle speeds<br>➕ more to come! <a href="https://t.co/2BVcHUXnu0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/2BVcHUXnu0</a></p>  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1980680538773213197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Adjustments are also made to the game's sliding and the mantling movements. The slide speed is lowered and distance has been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">"It still feels great. It still feels fluid," Scronce said when discussing the slide tuning. "But we want to make sure that's not the only way you can enter an engagement."</p><p dir="ltr">For mantling, the developer agreed with feedback that some of the mantling speeds felt too slow. Scrone said the team is going through every mantle in the game to make sure they all have consistent speed and everything feels fast and fluid.</p><p dir="ltr">Perk changes were also announced. Some perks were moved to different categories, and unpopular perks were combined to make more powerful options. One complaint from the beta was that so many powerful perks were stacked in the slot 1 category, so some of the perks are now shifted around to allow players to choose better perk combinations. This includes Tac Mask being moved from slot 1 to slot 2, Tac Sprinter from slot 3 to slot 1, and Cold-Blooded from slot 1 to slot 3.</p><p dir="ltr">As for combined perks, Black Ops 7's Shadow perk is being combined with the Engineer perk. This will allow players to not only see enemy traps but also move past them without triggering any effects. For melee players, Bruiser is now combined with the Close Shave perk. This will allow increased health regen and score for melee kills.</p><p dir="ltr">Aim-assist changes are also confirmed. The developer revealed that data collected from the beta revealed controller players were winning close-range fights, while mouse-and-keyboard players were winning longer-range fights. Because of this, Treyarch is making changes to rotational aim assist, including requiring the right thumbstick to be moving in the direction of a target for aim assist to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has received a few other major changes since its initial reveal. Catering to community feedback, Activision revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Call of Duty's Carry Forward program was canceled</a>. Black Ops 6 weapons, operators skins, and cosmetic items will no longer transfer over to Black Ops 7, with the only exception being some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/">Zombies-related content</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher also revealed that Black Ops 7 would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-multiplayer-will-be-non-sbmm-by-default-at-launch/1100-6535334/">launch with little or no SBMM</a>, making the game's matchmaking feel more like the classic system used in older Call of Duty games. This matchmaking change is something a portion of the community has been requesting for years.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports Madden 26 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"As part of our ongoing commitment to authenticity, we’ve incorporated this record-setting event from the real NFL into the game," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-october-22-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">development blog</a> detailing the update reads. "The historic 70-yard field goal was an extraordinary achievement that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible on the field. We brought this into Madden, giving players the chance to recreate this iconic moment themselves."</p><p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little set this record during the 2025 NFL preseason in an August matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers--quite the impressive accomplishment considering it was the first game of the preseason for both teams. It surpassed the previous NFL regular-season record of 66 yards.</p><p>“Can’t lie, there was probably a little bit of doubt," Little told ESPN in an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45934622/jaguars-kicker-cam-little-nails-70-yard-field-goal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>. "But I mean, we attempted a lot of long field goals in training camp. Had some 60, probably 65-pluses before [in practice]. And so, you know, I really wanted to just go out there and see what it would do.”</p><p>The jersey and shoe Little wore during the kick are now on display in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although the kick does not count toward official NFL record books since it took place in the preseason.</p>

<p>Pop Up, Superstar!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="0ab8c7f0d20ff"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ab8c7f0d20ff/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>This week, London will be treated to its very first pop-up Nintendo Store, making all of us UK Mario fans clutch our wallets in fear.</p>
<p>The shop opens to the public tomorrow (<strong>22nd October</strong>) in the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, where it will be stocking its sweet merch until <strong>16th November</strong>. Those hoping to visit before 26th Oct will need to <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">book a ticket</a> to attend, but you'll be able to rock up as usual after this date — just expect some good old-fashioned queuing!</p>
<p>Before the doors <em>officially</em> open, we have been lucky enough to get a sneak peek at the store and see some of the wonderful goodies within. Keen to give all those hoping to attend in the coming weeks a heads up on what you can expect, we've assembled the following merch gallery, so you can start to prep those wishlists.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the following pieces if you've spent much time browsing the Japanese Nintendo stock online, but this gives us a good chance to get our hands on it <em>without</em> booking a flight to Tokyo...</p>
<p>Let's start with some clothing, perfect for DK enthusiasts and Nintendo all-rounders alike:</p>

<p>There's home decor featuring the likes of Pikmin and Splatoon:</p>

<p>It couldn't be a Nintendo Store without plushies galore:</p>

<p>Some particularly neat figures of the statues found in the flagship Nintendo Stores in the US and Japan:</p>
<figure data-uuid="6d5774430139e"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d5774430139e/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plenty of Switch 2 merch and amiibo — you know, for those who <em>haven't</em> seen one yet...</p>

<p>And finally, the checkout, where bank balances weep into their exclusive pop-up store London tote bags</p>
<figure data-uuid="1f3737adccea0"><a title="Nintendo Store London Pop-Up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f3737adccea0/nintendo-store-london-pop-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We should note that there's no guarantee all of this merchandise will be on the shelves if you visit the pop-up later in its run — if there's one thing we've learnt about exclusive merch, it's that it sells out <em>fast</em>. That said, the store will be sticking around for a good while, so there's still plenty of time to visit if you find yourself in the big city.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-pc-demo-bloober-team/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-in-time-for-halloween-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-a-free-demo-on-pc.1330717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's latest release, Cronos: The New Dawn, now has a demo available for players on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, to coincide with the game also being on sale on both storefronts just in time for the Halloween season.</p>



<p>The new demo is 30 minutes long, and it's not for nothing, since if you decide to pick up the game after playing the demo, your progress from the demo carries over into the full version of the game, so you can continue playing without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Console players are left out of the fun, unfortunately for them, but if you have a capable PC, you'll be able to try out Bloober Team's latest release after its stunning Silent Hill 2 Remake. You can also check out a trailer for the demo below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | PC Demo Available Now | STEAM &amp; EPIC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muJlwDnk9Dk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The demo covers the game's first mission, giving you an overview and introduction to the combat, how the creatures you'll face merge into bigger, more terrifying monsters, and give you a taste for two of the game's weapons. Also, even though console players are left out of getting a free demo, they're included with regard to Cronos: The New Dawn being on sale, since it is 15% off on Steam, the Epic Games Store, the PlayStation Store (beginning on Oct.22), the Microsoft Store, the Nintendo eShop, and GOG.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed</a> Cronos: The New Dawn last month, he gave it an 8/10 and praised its setting, story, and level design paired with the new merge mechanic. "<em>With its by-the-books survival horror experience, its first few hours feeling more frustrating than fun due to clunky combat and average enemy design, Cronos: The Dawn seemed to be nothing more than an unremarkable survival horror heavily inspired by the Dead Space series. Push past the around two hours mark, however, and the game blossoms into one of Bloober Team's best titles to date, thanks to its quirky mechanics, solid level design, unique setting and mystery-filled story.</em>"</p>



<p>If you're looking for other Halloween-appropriate games to play as we near the end of the month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-halloween-sale-2025/">the Epic Games Store's current Halloween sale has several horror games on sale,</a> including Bloober Team's other major release in recent years, Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-dev-kit-price-chinese-tariffs-microsoft-2000637701</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-xbox-dev-kits-to-2-000.1330714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Current-gen Xbox dev kits used to cost $1,500. They’ll now be $2,000 for any game studio who wants to make a game for Xbox Series X/S and doesn’t already have one.</p> <p>That’s according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers">The Verge</a></em> which says developers received the updated pricing in a recent email from Microsoft. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” the email to game development partners apparently reads. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.”</p> <p>Microsoft has been blaming “macroeconomic” conditions for all of its recent price hikes without explicitly blaming President Trump’s 30-percent tariffs on Chinese imports as part of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">administration’s ongoing trade war</a>. The 33-percent price hike on dev kits comes after similar increases to the price of the Xbox consoles players can buy online and in stores, as well as a 50-percent spike in Game Pass Ultimate membership fees this month.</p>

 <p>While the tariffs explain the new barriers to making games for Xbox, the price increase <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ally-x-price-next-gen-hardware-console-2000637280">won’t help perceptions</a> that Microsoft is deprioritizing its hardware amid a new multiplatform publishing push and reported mandates from the tech giant’s c-suite to boost profit wherever possible. Game Pass has been a boon to some of the indie developers who get deals with it, but there are also plenty of smaller third-party games that now seem to skip Xbox at launch.</p> <p>Even Moon Studios, maker of the hit Xbox platformer <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, recently suggested the console port of its top-down Soulslike <em>No Rest for the</em> <em>Wicked</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659">would skip Xbox</a> at launch because the investment wasn’t worth the payoff right now. Nevertheless, Microsoft says its still developing next-gen hardware, and did just launch the new Asus-made Xbox Ally PC gaming handhelds. A developer could get two $1,000 Xbox Ally Xs for the price of a new dev kit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low-2000637674</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-forerunner-55-now-cheaper-than-a-regular-watch-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low.1330711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to be training for the New York Marathon to benefit from a GPS running watch that understands your fitness level. Most people just want to run a few miles without guessing their pace, track progress over time and maybe figure out why some runs feel easier than others. The Garmin Forerunner 55 handles all of that without the overwhelming feature bloat of flagship models, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $199 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The core appeal lies in how this watch removes the mental load from running: You lace up, press start and the GPS tracks your route while the optical heart rate sensor monitors your effort level. After the run, you get clear feedback on distance covered, average pace per mile, heart rate zones throughout the workout, and total elevation gain if you tackled any hills. This data accumulates over weeks and months and reveals patterns that help you understand what’s actually improving versus what just feels different on any given day.</p>
<h2>Two Weeks Battery Life</h2>
<p>Smartwatch battery life usually means charging every night or every other day, and turn your fitness tracker into another device competing for outlet space. The <strong>Forerunner 55 runs for two full weeks in normal smartwatch mode</strong>, displaying time, notifications and daily stats without needing a charge. Switch to GPS mode for tracking runs and you get 20 hours of continuous recording which is enough for multiple marathons back-to-back if you were so inclined.</p>
<p><em>PacePro</em> is worthy of coverage because it answers a common race-morning headache for runners. It can be set with a desired finish time for a certain distance, after which it works out precisely what your pace through every part of a course must be. If it’s a hilly course, it even makes automatic adjustments for you, urging you to ease off on ascents and accelerate on downhills in order to reach your total time target.</p>



<p>Each day’s recommendations come on to the watch screen in the morning from Garmin’s algorithms based on your last few sessions of training, your current level of fitness, and your recovery condition. It’s not boilerplate “run 3 miles today” recommendations. The system may suggest interval sessions if you’ve been running continuously through the week, for example, or recommend a gentle recovery jog if yesterday’s tempo run was especially strenuous. Each recommendation includes bespoke aims for duration, pace, and heart rate ranges, which is basically like your own coach that is tailored to how your body is reacting to training.</p>



<p>The activity library goes well beyond running: <strong>There is cycling, track running, virtual treadmill run, pool swim, Pilates, HIIT, breathwork</strong> with specific tracking modes that retain suitable metrics for that specific type of activity. <strong>Pool swim mode automatically tracks</strong> strokes and number of laps while HIIT tracks work as well as intervals of rest. The watch can therefore be worn through the whole calendar year even as running becomes secondary through seasons or when cross-training is dictated due to injuries.</p>
<p>Wellness features run continuously in the background and tracks stress levels through heart rate variability, monitoring respiration rate throughout the day, and calculates your fitness age based on activity patterns and VO2 max estimates. The Body Battery metric deserves special mention because it quantifies energy levels on a 0-100 scale, helping you understand when you’re actually recovered enough for hard training versus when you should take it easy.</p>
<p>The <em>Connect IQ Store</em> opens up customization so that you can switch up the watch face, add data fields that expose exactly the measurements you are concerned with when running, and third-party apps that increase functionality. You can add a weather app, load training plans from specific coaches, or load in data pages that are optimized for triathlon training in case your interests are elsewhere than running.</p>

                <p>Fortnite is reportedly set to get a major update in November that adds a big crossover with the iconic animated franchise The Simpsons. Now, the latest leaks have suggested that it won't just be The Simpson family coming to Fortnite, but also some of Springfield's residents, including Ned Flanders.</p><p>Flanders is among the best-known characters on The Simpsons, so his inclusion in the update would be little surprise. We don't know if this is true just yet, so take the leak with a grain of salt for now. Will there be a skin that celebrates <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Stupid_Sexy_Flanders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"stupid sexy Flanders"</a>? We'll have to wait and see.</p><p>The rumored upcoming Fortnite collaboration with The Simpsons is said to be significant, with Fortnite adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">new map based on Springfield</a> and featuring its various points of interest, like the nuclear power plant where Homer works.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">everything we've heard so far about the rumored Simpsons collaboration with Fortnite.</a> The new season is rumored to begin in early November.</p><p>In semi-related news, a fan-made re-skin of The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run focusing on Futurama has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simpsons-hit-run-designer-loves-fan-made-futurama-re-skin/1100-6535602/" data-ref-id="1100-6535602">drawn the praise of one of the game's original designers</a>.</p><p>As for the TV series, The Simpsons debuted in 1989 and is now in its 37th season. The show was renewed earlier this year and will continue through at least Season 40 in 2028-2029. A second Simpsons Movie is coming as well, and it's set for release in July 2027, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-announced-coming-july-2027/1100-6535348/" data-ref-id="1100-6535348">on the same day as A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-pc-performance-test-%E2%80%93-stuttering-like-starved-bloodsuckers.1330684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As of the publication of this article, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is finally out on all platforms. It took 21 years and a near-cancellation to get this sequel, which is really more of a spiritual successor, but those who have been yearning for a new action roleplaying game in the world of Vampire: The Masquerade now have a new game to play. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review</a>, I wrote that the game, albeit flawed, is worth a look if you are into the setting and genre, although you're probably better off waiting for a discount. The other big reason to delay getting your hands on this game is that maybe, just maybe, the developers will be able to improve the optimization, which is currently dreadful on PC.</p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is powered by Unreal Engine 5. However, it is pretty basic in its feature set. There are no ray traced settings to enable, and the game as a whole is far from the best showcase of Epic's game-making technology. Even the texture work is not always great, and the open world of Seattle is quite small by current standards. Long story short, it's not doing anything special.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 4K PC Gameplay - Open World and Side Content" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIGBaYKn66w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, by now, we are used to reporting about Unreal Engine games having troubles with stuttering, but this is on another level entirely. As you can see in the gameplay video, the game stutters constantly while in the open world, whereas most titles that suffer from this issue only have that problem when loading another big chunk of the playable area. When you go inside interiors, the stuttering is slightly less prominent (but not at all gone).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I used NVIDIA FrameView and FLAT to better analyze the very same open world gameplay segment seen in the footage. The results are frankly astounding, and not in a good way. As you can see from the frame time graph, we have an inexplicable peak of 175 milliseconds, but even taking that aside, many times during the custom benchmark the frame time spiked beyond 40ms, meaning the frame rate dropped to 25 frames per second. It may have been for just a moment, but that's what makes it jarring.</p>



<p>The average frame rate is not at all a problem. With a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, settings set to Ultra, NVIDIA DLAA enabled and NVIDIA DLSS Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, the game averages 220 frames per second. The issue is that it constantly drops very low, then picks back up again, and so on and so forth, providing the opposite of a smooth experience.</p>



<p>By the way, this isn't like the case of Dying Light: The Beast, where Techland later <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-hotfix-patch-addresses-frame-generation-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to fix an issue with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation that caused undue stuttering</a>. I actually played most of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with Frame Generation turned off, simply because it couldn't really help at all with this game's stuttering, and the issue was still there.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to FLAT, the game was stuttering 20,29% of the entire time of the benchmark, which is by far the worst result I have ever seen. Usually, even the worst cases of stuttering reach around 9 or 10%. The analysis thus confirms the subjective experience: this is perhaps the worst example of stuttering seen in a long time in a PC game, and we've seen a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>As if that wasn't enough, like I mentioned in the full review, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 also completely lacks support for High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays. This is just outright unacceptable for a game of this caliber that launches in late 2025. The first triple-A games started implementing HDR eight years ago, and nowadays most displays support HDR. Besides, based on what developers tell me, it should be really easy to implement it via Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don't have much good news to share with regard to the technical side of this game. Like I said, we can only hope that some optimization fixes will be introduced with a patch, but I had already warned the development team after the preview build and there were pretty much no improvements from that build to the launch one. Maybe now they will take a closer look.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-is-up-for-sale-currently-reviewing-interest-%E2%80%9Cfrom-multiple-parties%E2%80%9D.1330681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced that it is officially up for sale</a> and that it is reviewing interest and inquiries "<em>from multiple parties</em>." The announcement comes as Warner Bros is in the middle of splitting from Discovery Global, though that split isn't stopping Warner Bros. Discovery from taking a look at any offers it gets for someone who wants to come in and pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>WBD says the decision to publicly announce it is up on the shelf comes from the "<em>unsolicited interest the Company has received</em>," and that its board will remain open to all options, including "<em>continuing to advance the Company's planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, WBD is saying that if there's any company that wants the whole kit-and-kaboodle, that's an option. If a company wants to just buy separate parts of the company, like, for example, a company purchasing just the Warner Bros. Games division, that's an option. Or, of course, the WBD board could just not take any of these purchase offers and continue on its current course to separate from Discovery Global by mid-2026.</p>



<p>WBD is also considering "<em>an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally</em>," president and chief executive officer of WBD, David Zaslav, added in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</em> <em>It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets</em>."</p>



<p>This is not the first time the idea of Warner Bros. Discovery, as an entire company, or its separate businesses, has been on the shelf. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-sale-full-abandoned/">heard several rumours</a> in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/">including around acquisition interest from companies like Sony</a>, that some sort of sale would be possible, though nothing has materialized as of yet.</p>



<p>Specifically regarding the games division of Warner Bros., it's not unfair to say that David Zaslav and his leadership have absolutely mucked it up in recent years. Despite WBD's struggles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/">Hogwarts Legacy was a stunning commercial success</a>, and yet, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-might-be-making-dc-comics-live-service-game/">obsession with live service games</a> that plagues the triple-A videogame industry seems to have struck Zaslav and company more than most, with declarations that even having <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/">the best-selling game in a calendar year in your portfolio "<em>isn't enough</em>."</a></p>



<p>While making triple-A games has become more expensive, it would certainly be easier if the company financing those triple-A games also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-11/warner-bros-discovery-chief-david-zaslavs-pay-hits-52-million-as-board-changes-loom">didn't have to pay insane salaries to its top executives</a>. Not over paying <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">for people who clearly aren't doing the best job</a> would also probably help retain the veteran, top-level talent that WBD used to have on its employment sheet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">instead of invoking mass layoffs and shuttering studios that have been around for decades</a>.</p>



<p>The whole statement from WBD today puports, like many of its statements, that this has all been done with shareholders in mind and that reviewing potential sales from interested parties "<em>is in the best interest of shareholders</em>." It's worth noting that what's also likely in the best interest of shareholders of WBD is giving Zaslav the boot, and installing a president who won't run the company so badly that it needs to go <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">through major restructuring</a> and/or beg for a saviour to swoop in and buy it while the franchises it holds licensing rights to still have value.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After raising prices on Xbox consoles and subscriptions, Microsoft is now turning its attention to Xbox developers. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the company is significantly increasing the price of its Xbox Development Kit (XDK) — the custom hardware used by developers to build Xbox games.</p><p>The current Xbox dev kit is moving from $1,500 to $2,000, a 33 percent jump in price. “The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,” says Microsoft in an announcement to Xbox developers, seen by <em>The Verge</em>. “We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.” I asked Microsoft to comment on the price rise, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p><p>The price increases to the Xbox dev kit come just a month after Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hiked the price of its Xbox Series X</a> console for the second time this year. The second price increase to the Series X means the console is now $150 more than it was just six months ago.</p><p>Microsoft also blamed “changes in the macroeconomic environment” for its latest Xbox console price hike last month, and both the increases to consoles and dev kits, 30 percent and 33 percent respectively, align with the Trump administration’s 30 percent tariff on imports from China. A recent report suggested that Microsoft is pushing to produce more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/800538/microsoft-surface-manufacturing-china-move-report">Xbox consoles outside of China</a>, in a clear attempt to reduce the impact of the tariffs.</p><p>The short announcement from Microsoft’s Xbox developer relations team makes it clear that this price increase goes into effect immediately. I understand it’s not just impacting US developers, as the price of these development kits is also going up across Europe and elsewhere. That’s likely because those “macroeconomic” conditions extend beyond just US tariffs, with currency fluctuations, production costs, and other elements impacting pricing.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox dev kit was already expensive because it comes with additional hardware on the inside and out, to let developers build and test Xbox games for both the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. Microsoft has equipped its latest dev kit with 40GB of GDDR6 memory, instead of the 16GB found on the Xbox Series X console. It also has a more compute units enabled, the all-important debugging tools onboard for testing games, and three USB ports at the front. Microsoft also equips its Xbox dev kits with a front panel display and five programmable buttons.</p><div><p>The dev kit price hikes also come just weeks after Microsoft hiked the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price of its Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscription by 50 percent.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/803237/microsoft-xbox-devkit-price-hikes-developers]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Sure, you can use your regular earbuds while gaming, but if you’re after immersive in-game sound with a solid mic that lets you chat with other players clearly, getting your hands on a gaming headset makes sense. Even better, you can snag one for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/">Amazon is being generous with a 20% discount on the HyperX CloudX gaming headset, bringing the price down to just $40.</a> The compatibility is impressive, and it offers exceptional comfort for longer sessions. Just note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so you might want to act fast to grab it before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive In-Game Sound for a Realistic Experience</h2>
<p>For under $50, you’re getting a headset that gives off a premium look and is quite sturdy. Ear cushions are plush, so you won’t need to take these off every couple of hours to give your ears a break. Sound-wise, you will enjoy rich audio and enhanced bass that makes you feel like you’re right in the middle of the action. Subtle footsteps in the background or whispers from the bad guys; you’re going to hear it all clearly.</p>
<p>There’s a detachable noise-cancellation microphone that cuts through background noise – your squad hears you without unwanted distractions. It comes with a flexible braided cable that lets you position the mic in different ways, plus withstands the daily wear and tear well. The mic also pops off when not in use. That way, you can use the headset like normal over-ear headphones whenever you want. Listening to music while working or playing a single-player title where you don’t need to give or take commands? Just take the mic off and you’re good to go.</p>



<p>Tweaking sound settings will be a matter of seconds, too. In-line audio controls make it easy to quickly make adjustments without digging into on-screen menus. As for compatibility, the headset works well with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S controllers. You can also use it with pretty much any device that has a 3.5mm audio jack, whether it’s your PC or a smartphone.</p>
<p>All things considered, this deal is offering a great chance to upgrade your in-game sound experience for less.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4904/"> It was already quite affordable at $60, but Amazon is letting you grab it for $40 for a short time</a>. The offer won’t last long, so be sure to grab it fast.</p>

<p>Despite rumours, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on its previously revealed release date, November 14, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don’t know, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from yesterday stated that there was evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7, with the game arriving a week earlier. However, Treyarch has debunked this claim, revealing that the release date for the upcoming title remains on track. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-to-release-on-november-14-as-planned">Black Ops 7 To Release on November 14 As Planned</h2>



<p>The latest post from Treyarch on <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses the release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The developers have stated, “We’re less than a month away from #BlackOps7’s launch on November 14,” which clears up any doubts about a potential announcement of a release date change. The post also talks about their newest dev talk dropping today, October 21, along with more juicy multiplayer updates from the beta. </p>

<p>Talking about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta, it was revealed that RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99% of the matches were cheater-free</a>, and cheaters were detected within three matches. This is excellent news for fans of the series, as Call of Duty has been one of the franchise’s biggest victims of in-game cheating. Hopefully, the case remains the same during launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 developers have announced that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-will-have-non-disbanding-lobbies-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature</a> non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. Additionally, the game didn’t include a Wall Run feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-wall-run-due-to-its-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to its timeline</a>.

Use Blazikens Seething Spirit to grab fire energy from your discard pile to build up Volcanion. In the meantime Volcanion can burn opposing Pokémon then use Scorching Cyclone for 160 damage then transfer all it's energy to a benched Pokémon.

Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/lego-toys">LEGO</a>, Hallmark has ventured into licenses and partnerships with companies that make fun things: video games, movies, TV shows, etc. One of the latest new Hallmark Keepsake ornaments for 2025 is one that will have Xbox fans (both current and lapsed) excited to put up their Christmas trees this year. It’s a small, yet intricately detailed, re-creation of the Xbox 360 console. It even plays the Halo theme song when you press the button. It’s available now, for $28.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound - Hallmark Keepsake Christmas Ornament 2025</h2><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229617"><div id="229617" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound (Plays Halo Theme Song)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 console ornament is 3.25 inches tall. It’s an almost perfectly scaled-down model of the iconic white console that was first released in 2005. The ornament has the console standing up, with a white Xbox 360 controller leaning against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As indicated by the higher-than-usual price, it’s a “With Light and Sound” ornament. The power button on the console glows green when you press it. It then emits the familiar Xbox 360 startup sound, followed by about 20 seconds of “Behold a Pale Horse,” a song from the Halo 3 soundtrack. You can watch a video of it on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing page</a>.</p></div><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229615"><div id="229615" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Halo 3 - Master Chief Xbox 360</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, also new this year in the Hallmark Keepsake line is an awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-3-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Halo 3 ornament</a> that features the game’s box, with Master Chief actually emerging from it, 3D-style.

The Xbox 360 paved the way for so many things we take for granted these days, from easy online play to huge open-world games. And even though the console came out 20 years ago, that’s the platform Grand Theft Auto V debuted on, a game that’s still relevant today in the lead-up to the sequel. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More New 2025 Hallmark Keepsake Ornaments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other new ornaments to choose from, including this awesome (yet pricy!) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-new-100-star-wars-hallmark-ornament-requires-a-separate-power-cord-purchase">Star Wars ornament</a> that requires a power cord that's sold separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

              <p>Wiring outdoor security cameras means drilling through walls, fishing cables through attics, hiring electricians and accepting permanent placement decisions you’ll regret six months later when you realize the angle is wrong. The <strong>Eufy security SoloCam S220</strong> solves all of that with a completely wireless design powered by a built-in solar panel that keeps itself charged indefinitely.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/">dropped it to an all-time low of $59 after applying both the automatic 35% discount and an additional on-page coupon, down from its usual $99 price</a>. For homeowners tired of package thieves, this represents the easiest path to outdoor surveillance that actually works.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4912/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The solar charging eliminates the largest headache with wireless cameras: battery anxiety. Older battery-powered wireless cameras must be recharged every few weeks or even months, requiring you to pull out ladders and break up coverage precisely when coverage is needed most. The <strong>unit power is fueled with only three hours of sunlight per day to keep it fully charged indefinitely</strong>. The <strong>built-in solar panel is flush-mounted</strong> on top of the camera enclosure so that no separate panel is needed to be mounted and no wires are needed to be run between modules. Even during short winter days when sunlight is scarce, the capacity of the battery reserves is enough to sustain recording through several weeks’ worth of cloudiness without maintenance.</p>

The <strong>2K resolution used here equates to 2304 x 1296 pixels</strong>, much clearer than 1080p standard-resolution cameras which top out at 1920 x 1080. The increased resolution means you can indeed <strong>read license plates from 20 feet distant</strong> or make out facial features well enough for police purposes.</p>



<p>The f/1.6 aperture owes more to image quality than most spec sheets describe. Aperture determines how much light reaches the sensor, with lower numbers meaning more light reaches it. An f/1.6 specification is outstanding for security webcams, which are usually around f/2.0 or larger. This larger aperture paired with infrared LEDs provides<strong> valuable night vision that reveals detail in almost complete darkness</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>AI detection system</strong> differentiates this from ordinary motion-activated cameras that buzz your phone every time a leaf moves by. The onboard processor interprets patterns of movement to differentiate humans from animals, cars, and natural movement such as swaying branches. You are only alerted when real people come into view, minimizing notification fatigue significantly. The camera is connected to Eufy’s HomeBase 3 hub for advanced facial tracking that can distinguish between your family members, regular package deliverers, and unfamiliar guests, although the camera operates fully without the hub on standard human detection.</p>



<p><strong>Installation requires approximately 15 minutes overall</strong>. The miniature housing is approximately 3 inches in diameter, small enough to be installed inconspically under eaves or on fence posts without appearing to be overt surveillance gear. Since it’s wire-free, you drill a single mounting hole, place the supplied anchor, and twist on the camera itself. The magnetic base lets you make angle adjustments without tools so that you can tweak your view after reviewing initial coverage.</p>
<p>Both discounts applied at $59 means you are paying well under many indoor cams but receive weatherproof build rated for outdoor use, solar charging which means no maintenance needed, and AI detection that works.</p>

                <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier is launching an investigation into developer Roblox Corporation, alleging that the online game creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is a "breeding ground" for predators that enables child abuse.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-issues-criminal-subpoenas-roblox-protect-children" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a> from the Republican's office, Uthmeier said he and his team will be issuing Roblox Corporation "criminal subpoenas" for "profiting off of our kids and exposing them to the most dangerous of harms." This investigation will allow Uthmeier to determine whether the company's action or inaction aids child abuse.</p><p>"Companies like Roblox have become breeding grounds for predators to get to and have access to our kids," Uthmeier said in an October 20 video posted to X. "These criminal subpoenas will enable us to gather more information for our prosecutors about the criminal activity taking place on the Roblox platform, as well as evidence on the predators that are out there and the victims that are abused."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are issuing criminal subpoenas to Roblox, which has become a breeding ground for predators to gain access to our kids. <a href="https://t.co/vcyTVnkrxU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/vcyTVnkrxU</a></p>  — Attorney General James Uthmeier (@AGJamesUthmeier) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Roblox has faced scrutiny over its child safety, particularly <span>following <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" rel="nofollow ">a</a></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> June 2024 Bloomberg report</a> that found the platform has a rampant pedophile problem. AGs Russell Coleman (R-Kentucky) and Liz Murrill (R-Louisiana) have issued lawsuits against Roblox for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/kentucky-lawsuit-roblox-fails-protect-children-popular-online-126310412" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">failing to protect children</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/louisiana-sues-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">facilitating the distribution of child sexual abuse material</a>. Meanwhile, two other lawsuits--<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roblox-online-gaming-giant-child-predator-allegations-lawsuits-2025-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one filed in Georgia</a> and <a href="https://www.kgns.tv/2025/08/22/13-year-old-girl-targeted-by-predator-roblox-lawsuit-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another in St. Louis</a>--alleged that two kids (one eight and the other 13) were targeted by predators. Nearly 40% of Roblox's users are under the age of 13, and although Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik said the recent negative press towards the game is based on events from "<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">five years ago</a>," these lawsuits were filed this year.</p><p>This is what prompted Uthmeier to investigate Roblox Corporation. He explained in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/sites/default/files/2025-0909_roblox.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the full subpoena</a> that, through the multiple investigations revealing that predators are grooming minors with the in-game currency Robux, the company must face justice.</p><p>"At the end of the day, we will stop at nothing to fight to protect our kids," he said. "And companies that act carelessly and expose them to harm will be held accountable."</p><p>Roblox Corporation now must respond to the subpoena and appear before Tampa, Florida's assistant statewide prosecutor Rita Pavan Peters on December 20.</p>
