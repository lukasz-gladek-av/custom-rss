		<p>TiMi Studios’s Team Jade has shared a fresh look at Delta Force: Hawk Ops, announcing that the game will be playable during the next Steam Next Fest in October, before kicking off PC Early Access in Q4 of this year. The game is coming to PS5, PS4, PC and mobile.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force - Gamescom 2024 Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DNcXW26gtPk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops is set to be a free-to-play online FPS, reviving the classic game franchise for a modern audience. The Delta Force will return with a lot of high tech and upgraded weapons within a dynamic world. Large scale multiplayer battles look like they will have the kind of vehicular combat and building destruction that will appeal to Battlefield fans, while there’s also the kinds of high tech gadgetry that has come to define Ghost Recon games of late.</p>
<p>There will be multiple game modes, including Havoc Warfare, which will include battles across land, sea and air, while Hazard Operations shifts gears for an extraction shooter form. There’s also a Black Hawk Down campaign that is inspired by the Ridley Scott film.</p>
<p>The game has been in development for a while, first at NovaLogic, before the rights were acquired by Tencent and development duties handed over to TiMi Studios, who are best known for having developed Call of Duty: Mobile.<sup id="cite_ref-4"></sup></p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/the-first-borderlands-movie-reviews-are-in-and-they-dont-hold-back/">Borderlands film release</a>, Gearbox has announced that Borderlands 4 is coming… and it’s coming next year in 2025!</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - Official Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>All that we have is this teaser trailer at this time, depicting a vast crystalline attack on a moon and planet, before the now iconic Psycho bandit mask is revealed to confim that yes, this is Borderlands 4. “The next Borderlands” was confirmed to be in development earlier this year, but this states clearly that it’s the next numbered entry in the series.</p>
<p>This announcement is sure to go down well amongst series fans. While the film did… not meet expectations, there’s still a huge amount of love for the Borderlands series and its spin-offs – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands.</a> We defniitely preferred Wonderlands to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">Borderlands 3,</a> in large part for the tone and style of humour, and hope Gearbox strikes a fresh balance between the two.</p>
<p>We said of Borderlands 3, “I’ve got very mixed feelings about Borderlands 3. Overall I like it and it’s fun to play, but it could have been so much more and the writing feels like time traveling back to your high school days and being surprised and a little disappointed at how immature everyone is. Few things in life are as embarrassing as the person you were five years ago. If you’re not embarrassed, then I’m sorry to say that you may well be the Borderlands 3 of your friend group; stuck in the past unable to grow or change in any meaningful way, relying on fart jokes as a stand-in for your personality.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Take-Two acquired Gearbox from Embracer for $460 million</a> – paid for in newly created stocks that Embracer is expected to cash out as soon as possible to help ease their cashflow problems. Borderlands 4 would have been deep into development at the time, pushing Take-Two to make the acquisition of one of their key money-makers. They also acquired the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/homeworld-3/">Homeworld</a>, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem IP at the same time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During a pre-Gamescom 2024 remote briefing event held by Bethesda, we learned more about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle through a remote presentation and subsequent roundtable Q&amp;A with two key developers: Game Director Jerk Gustafsson and Creative Director Axel Torvenius.</p>
<p>This time, the developers at MachineGames focused on showing off gameplay: how Indiana interacts with the world around him, how he traverses the environment, and how he deals with the enemy. They also highlighted some of his key tools: the camera and journal.</p>
<p>The developers claimed to have made the gameplay experience as interesting and authentic as possible. They described Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a game rich with detail, intriguing environments, and hidden secrets, evoking a sense of curiosity. For the temples of Sukhothai, they studied photographs and drawings from early expeditions to imagine what these temples actually looked like. Back then, they were much more overgrown, hidden away in the wilderness, and, of course, less renovated and reconstructed.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, players will encounter several well-guarded secrets and hidden ruins, such as the Sunsparker Chamber, a mysterious underground temple where an ancient artifact of great value can be found. This space was forged with forgotten techniques by builders that have since fallen into oblivion.</p>
<p>The game was designed around the charm and resourcefulness of the heroes, Indiana and his Italian journalist companion, Gina. This race for answers will take players to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more. The focus of this game is adventure. MachineGames wants exploration to feel truly rewarding with all of Indy's tools, and it's up to players to find clever and even unexpected uses for each of them.</p>
<p>That includes Indy's camera. Snapping photos may reveal historical insights and important clues. Similarly, the journal acts as a complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of the journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where Indiana has been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</p>
<p>The developers also discussed finer aspects of gameplay. Sometimes, Indiana will have to enter restricted areas; that's where disguises come in. Borrowing familiar mechanics seen in many games, players should keep far from those enemies with a sharp eye for spotting trespassers. Of course, the game features the whip, arguably Indy's most important tool. It's a powerful weapon in combat and a crucial tool for traversing lost ruins.</p>
<p>The key to the game's combat is carefully choosing the right approach. It is possible to outsmart enemies by stealth and smartly using the environment, such as picking up a nearby object to distract, stun, or subdue enemies while remaining unnoticed. In a brawl, Indiana must stand his ground with powerful combos, blocks, and defensive parries. Melee combat was designed to look and feel exciting. Precisely timing and mixing these moves is critical to landing a knockout combo or classic finisher, and these brawling skills can be seamlessly combined with the whip, revolver, and anything else within reach for creative combat.</p>
<p>Just like Indy, players will navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle was designed to fit seamlessly into the world, ranging from smaller challenges, hidden and forbidden secrets, to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries.</p>
<p>As players complete missions in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, they'll earn adventure points to expand Indy's skillset. There will be dozens of upgrades that let you customize his abilities to your playstyle; for example, the ability called True Grit gives Indy an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow.</p>
<p>The developers also explained that players are encouraged to take off the main path and uncover new missions, mysteries and secrets. The game's open areas provide the freedom to find your own adventures. Exploring with a keen eye is essential to making discoveries. The authentic locations set in 1930s you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, but the team hopes players always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets lurking around every corner.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game is officially scheduled to launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X this year (although a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> a PS5 version might be released in 2025).</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the game's timeline, where does it take place?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius:</strong> It is set near 1937, after the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, and it takes place a fairly short amount of time just after that movie is set in the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>We saw adventure points pop up when Indy snapped photos. How are these used in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>We have something in the game that we call adventure books. Those are items that you find in the world for exploration and playing the game, completing activities and missions. Also, through just exploration and discovery, you will be rewarded with adventure points. Each adventure book contains a skill, and you can use these points to unlock the skills. It's pretty straightforward, but we think it really works well for this type of game.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk more about how the journal and the camera work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>So, the journal is one of the core tools we have in the game. We like to see the journal as this guide that documents your journey from the very start to the end. Everything you do is basically documented in this journal throughout, and the camera plays a big part in that because we use the camera to take photos, and those photos you take are also added to your journal. The camera is also a very useful tool for solving puzzles because we use it a lot for taking photos for clues and additional information, and also for hints to solve puzzles. Everything is very connected and works well together, so we are quite happy with the results.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'A lot of focus has been going on specifically trying to analyze and look at the tone and the beats, specifically from the older movies, and we've been trying to dissect and pick out the cherries in terms of making sure that the comedy the tone and that whole vibe is translated into the game experience in several different ways.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong> What was the process/challenge of transitioning from Wolfenstein to Indiana Jones?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>I think I will take that one as well. It's actually a very good question because I've been thinking about it a little bit more lately, actually because we could see it on the team as well, that the step from going from what we are so used to doing with these pretty guns blazing, crazy shooting experience that we have done to something that is much more lighthearted, much more matinee in many ways, has been a pretty big step but also very fun. It has taken some time to do that transition for sure. But it's something that I think has been very refreshing for the team and the studio. It's been fun to work in many different ways.</p>
<p><strong>How has the team worked to capture the comedy of the film series to make Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feel authentic to the franchise?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>A lot of focus has been going on specifically trying to analyze and look at the tone and the beats, specifically from the older movies, and we've been trying to dissect and pick out the cherries in terms of making sure that the comedy the tone and that whole vibe is translated into the game experience in several different ways. We have parts of it in gameplay. We have interesting things and fun nods to it, like in a fistfight where you take down a guard with a finishing move, Indiana shakes his hand and he's like, oh, my knuckles are hurting.</p>
<p>We have a lot of it represented in cutscenes, dialogue, and how the narrative is written. We've been trying heavily to incorporate those aspects throughout the entire game experience, not only in cutscenes and narrative but also in gameplay and the minute-to-minute gameplay, basically.</p>
<p>I think that is also part of this whole transition into something that is much more matinee, like I mentioned before. Just going from something that is very action heavy and to focus on something that is more adventure heavy. Internally, we even call this machine games adventure to still have some of that action in there because we still have action in there And quite a lot of focus on the story itself, but also everything that involves these great adventures for visiting cool places around the world.</p>
<p>You get to explore these hidden temples that have been closed for thousands of years, bypass deadly traps, and then encounter a lot of cool and colorful characters from different cultures around the world. It's very adventure focused and I think that is the big difference for us as a studio. You will see a lot of that in the experience when you play the game, that it's something rather unique for us.</p>
<p><strong>How big are the environments in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and are there secrets to find off the beaten path within them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>We can say that this is by far the biggest game MachineGames has made so far. We have some sections of the game that are more open and some that are more linear. But the sections that are more open allow for a lot of exploration, and we have much content to explore that is not only tied to the golden path and the story path. There are plenty of opportunities to explore the environment and find secrets and hidden things. You will see there is a lot in there.</p>
<p><strong>What was your approach to figuring out the perfect ratio of action to more methodical moments of exploration and puzzle-solving?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Also a very good question. I think the starting point for us was to try to just ignore the shooting part because we know it so well, and we know that we can do it well. So it's never something that would concern us. We know that we can get that right.</p>
<p>Very early on, we did this pie chart with different types of experiences, everything from stealth to hand-to-hand combat, navigation, and traversals, especially including with, which is so important for a brand like this and started to focus on those things that we knew were going to be very challenging, especially in first person, like the game is played in with hand-to-hand and the whip combat. That was our starting point. Start with and focus on the things that we know would be difficult to develop first and then move back to the more easy stuff later.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It was always first-person. For us it's just such an obvious choice. In general, for me, it's all about presence, and I think presence also leads to the immersion that we're looking for. When it comes to a character like Indiana Jones, I want to play and be the character. I want to look and explore the world through his eyes.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Did you ever think of making Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in third person view, or was the goal always first person?</b></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>No, it was always first. That might sound weird, and I totally understand also that it's unexpected for a game like this, but for us it's just such an obvious choice. We have been working with first-person games for over 20 years. I just realized that it was like 20 years ago now since we released Riddick. So it's something that is very much part of our DNA. It's too important for us in the way we make games.</p>
<p>In general, for me, it's all about presence, and I think presence also leads to the immersion that we're looking for. When it comes to a character like Indiana Jones, I want to play and be the character. I want to look and explore the world through his eyes.</p>
<p>For me, that's a very important part of everything we do here, so it was a very easy choice. We also mix in some third-person elements here. We have very much gone back to our own history with games like Riddick and The Darkness, where we also mixed first-person and third-person perspectives. Everything is not in first person, even though the core experience is.</p>
<p>I think we have taken the path that we felt very secure in taking, but also a path that makes this type of game very unique, especially since we draw so much inspiration from the old classic point and click games as well and focus so much on the immersive adventure part.</p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>I just want to add that there's a great opportunity here as well for us because we do have a large section of the game that is about mystery, about solving puzzles, it's being up front and close to ancient relics, ruins, and scriptures. There is an intimacy to the adventure in the sense that you get really up close and can really inspect things, which is actually pretty nice how it plays out in the game now.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Riddick. Many dev team members worked on it before forming MachineGames. Was Escape from Butcher Bay a direct influence on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>In a way, yes. We did a game before Riddick, but Riddick was the first game where we really started to create this formula that we continue to work based on with strong character-driven storytelling mixed with a lot of variation in gameplay.</p>
<p>Even though everything from Riddick forward has been very focused on very mature, violent stories, and high intensity action, it's still very much what we want to do, even with this game. It's just that it shifts the tone quite drastically towards something that is much more matinee and that has been rather refreshing and nice for the team and fun for the team to work on. We feel very happy about where we are, but yes, Riddick was absolutely an inspiration for this game, too.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be separate difficulty scaling for puzzles versus combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Yes. We do have the option to tune down or lower the, I wouldn't say, make it easier but in a way, the complexity of the puzzles can be reduced a little bit for difficulty settings.</p>
<p>We will also, of course, have some options when it comes to difficulty in general. We call the setting the, you have the action experience that you can tune difficulty on, and then you also have the adventure experience where you can tune the difficulty on, and puzzles are part of the adventure experience. We like to think that we give the players more options than we have ever done before in our games, so that's fun, too.</p>
<p><strong>Can you speak to how difficult the puzzles might be in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle? Or are there any puzzles if they're too difficult? Are there hints given if needed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>It's also a pretty good question because I'm one of those guys who doesn't really like very difficult puzzles. I like to just enjoy the experience and don't be so challenged by them. But with that said, we do have a mix because I like a lot of variation and it's not like we have, some unique puzzle mechanic that just goes across the entire game. We try to do and create every puzzle in a very, in a different, unique way.</p>
<p>We have those big set piece or hero puzzles that are very much part of the main storyline. But, like Axel talked about, providing a lot of different content and a lot of optional content as well to players also allow us to do a number of, and quite a lot of them actually, these more challenging puzzles as well, but they are all optional when it comes to that level of challenge. But those who are looking for puzzles that can be hard to solve will also be happy.</p>

But those who are looking for puzzles that can be hard to solve will also be happy.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How dynamic will missions be? Can you choose to go in guns blazing, use stealth, or a mix of both?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>We've been trying to push to make sure that you should first try to use your wits and your whip to some extent to look at the environment and think and understand that there are optional ways of coming through obstacles. The only solution in this game is absolutely not to shoot your way through. You can potentially, in some scenarios, do that, but it's very dangerous in this game to fire a gun. It's dangerous to be shot at, and it's dangerous to shoot at.</p>
<p>We are trying to push the balance. You can use a gun, but we are balancing it towards more about being clever, how you solve a situation and how you navigate around an enemy rather than through them. It's funny actually, because in the beginning of the project, especially within the team and going back to everybody so used to do guns blazing, everybody was very concerned that, because I also want to allow and give the players the ability to do everything they have at disposal, so I never want to prevent the player to use their gun or the revolver in this case, and there was a lot of concern about that. 'Yeah, but players will just shoot your way through'. But given the focus, we had on everything else, especially the hand-to-hand, which also we use Riddick as a reference for.</p>
<p>In many ways, it moved us into a game now where we see people playing who rarely use the weapons, so that's very interesting to see, actually. It is stealth and hand to hand combat and the whip that is to go to. And that makes me very happy, but you, as a player, have a choice.</p>
<p>You can do pretty much whatever you want as long as you have the tools. There are many scenarios where it can come through an environment without using guns at all just by sneaking and stealth and being smart about how you are progressing. I like to see the whip as a good entry point to combat. Then you do the hand-to-hand stuff, and then if you really get cornered, yes, then maybe you can pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>Can you speak to the rough gameplay length of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Without mentioning specific hours in play length, what we can say is that this is by far the biggest game we've done at MachineGames. If you are exploring and doing everything and looking at all the content and playing out all the activities and missions, you will have your handful of hours to get through, that's for sure.</p>
<p>It depends on the player's style. If you're just running through the golden path and the story beats, then, of course, it will be shorter, but if you play everything, there's a lot of content in this game.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's big. Even if you just run through the storyline, it's still longer than any game we have done before. We're quite happy with it.</p>
<p><strong>Will we have big side missions during Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<div role="heading" aria-level="2" data-attrid="title">
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Yes, there will be a lot of different things or activities you can do. We also have this mix, like Axel was talking about earlier, of more linear missions combined with these bigger open areas. Usually, how they are constructed is that it's good to do one or two of these side missions within the open areas to continue towards the main story path. But those missions are still rather long, and it's a matter of hours, not minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Can you describe your working relationship with Lucasfilm Games? Did you visit their headquarters and look through the Indiana Jones archives?</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>The experience with Lucasfilm Games has been super cool. We've been very excited from the get go to have the opportunity to work with them and work closely with them because that's what we've been doing.</p>
<p>We've been having regular weekly meetings throughout the entire production with representatives of each department within Lucasfilm. That has been an extremely treasured resource when it comes to seeking their expertise. and vetting some of the designs that we've been working on to make sure that we were on track and on the path of selling the correct version of Indiana Jones, which is also, of course, the one that we want to push.</p>
<p>We have not been traveling physically, but we have had access to Lucasfilm archives. As nerds and fans of the IP, it's been extremely cool and privileged to be able to browse through old behind-the-scenes photos and weird concept art that you never thought existed, etc. From Raiders and the early movies.</p>
<p><strong>What was the process of balancing the expectations of an iconic character and franchise while also telling a unique story in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Oh, that's also a good question. I don't really know. We have been working with characters based on movies and franchises for a long time and we have been finding a way. You evolve them into something that we feel is our own. Obviously, Indiana Jones is a little bit different because it's such a well-known and iconic character, so that vault of knowledge that Lucasfilm possesses is very, has been very useful for us. But I wouldn't say that it has impacted us in any way when it comes to the work we do to create a good story.</p>
<p>I think what we set out to do from the beginning was also something that Axel was talking about earlier. We wanted to continue the story arc of this character that everybody learned to love from Raiders of the Lost Ark and then just take it from there. We have this gap between Raiders and The Last Crusade that is very interesting to us where we can find and fit this great circle of story in the timeline. But the process of working through a story and how we write the story has been pretty similar to what we have done before.</p>
<p>It's more about finding the tone to align with our ambition to try to fit it with these movies from the eighties and at the same time, the time it takes place in, 1947, with a more pulpy feeling. That combination mix has been a very good and interesting foundation, I would say, for our story, so we are extremely happy with it. Also, of course, we want to thank Todd Howard in many ways for bringing it to us because the whole great circle idea and building the story around that phenomenon was originally an idea from Todd Howard.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the movies, what are y'all's favorite Indiana Jones movies, and what film do you think the Great Circle is closest in tone to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>For me, it's easy. It's Raiders of the Lost Ark. childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Yeah, it's also our main reference point for the game. But I would still say Last Crusade because I also like that generation gap, and I like that part with River Phoenix and Sean Connery. There are also great actors there. So it's just more of this great matinee adventure for me. And I really love that, so I would say Last Crusade.</p>
<p><strong>Can you speak to the casting of Troy Baker and Indy in any direction to make him sound more like Harrison Ford?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Axel</strong> <strong>Torvenius: </strong>We are extremely happy that we have Troy. The first time I heard the test lines coming through, I thought, okay, this is the reference material. But no, it was actually Troy Baker. So we've been very happy that he's delivering as well as he does. I couldn't imagine anyone else doing&nbsp;a better job.</p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>He's also a super big Indie fan, and he's been extremely supportive and helpful as well. He even joins our blockhouse shoots here in the studio before the big shoots. That just shows his passion. It's been a great experience working with Troy.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be snakes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jerk Gustafsson: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a new stand-alone game that brings back the legendary hero Kyle Crane into a new zombie adventure. You get to play as Kyle Crane, where you explore a rural area, as Kyle Crane realizes there is more at stake than revenge.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a new thrilling 18+ hour standalone zombie adventure in the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, an area once a popular tourist destination. Kyle Crane endured 13 years of experiments, and you have to escape and hunt down your captors in an attempt to seek revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c50gFkG91jc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game comes almost ten years after the launch of the original Dying Light game, with Techland announcing that Roger Craig Smith has reprized his role of Kyle Crane for this new game. "Stepping back into Kyle Crane's shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend. And even though he's gone through a terrible time, there's still plenty of legendary hero left in him," says Smith.</p>
<p>Due to the experiments you underwent, you can unleash a beast-like power as you have zombie DNA flowing through your veins. While before you may have thought it was a curse, it is key to your survival in Castor Woods, and can help you make it through safely.</p>
<p>If you are hoping for multiplayer, you can play this game in 4-player co-op or solo, depending on your play style.</p>
<p>For those who own Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition, you can get Dying Light: The Beast for free, as this game was initially started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. At the moment, Dying Light: The Beast doesn't have an official release date or price tag, but if you have been considering exploring the franchise, now is the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-open-beta-is-out-now-introducing-a-brand-new-co-op-experience/">Dying Light 2: Stay Human</a> was released in 2022, receiving mostly positive reviews, and is currently popular on Steam. Dying Light 2: Stay Human is also on sale if this is a franchise you want to explore to prepare for Dying Light: The Beast.</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast has no official release date; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a> simply says, "Coming soon."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> cinematic-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> series, right up until the name <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reanimal">Reanimal</a> appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.</p>
<p>It’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Still, Reanimal does have a few new tricks that, even if it were a direct sequel to Tarsier’s previous works, would qualify it as a noticeable departure. It’s two player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, for starters. Local or online, though you’ll still be able to play through solo.</p>
<p>“The easy solution would have been to make it split-screen… but we didn’t want people to ever feel alone. We wanted to force players to go through together,” says narrative director David Mervik, who also wrote for both Little Nightmares games. Mervik cites Hazelight’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> as an influence, but says that Tarsier aimed for a more minimalist approach with Reanimal.</p>
<p>Mervik describes the aim as offering up “that cathartic experience of going through something awful together.” New, too, is a directed, shared camera; distinct from Little Nightmares’ fixed, side-on perspective. The aim here is more curated, directed scenes, even as you're off exploring optional locations.</p>
<p>The question that sparked the new direction for Reanimal was, says Mervik, “What if we could get that sense of adventure - with a slightly diminished scope than The Windwaker - with that thick claustrophobic dread that you feel in, like, Silent Hill 2."</p>
<p>“For us, [adventure] has been the word,” he continues. “We want that sense of excitement, but also that sense of abject terror. But if that’s all you ever feel, you begin to not feel anything.” So, you’ll be able to travel by boat, discovering smaller areas off the main path, and maybe help your crew of orphans discover more about what’s going on in this world.</p>
<p>But Reanimal’s most striking twist on Little Nightmares is its new preoccupation with big barnyard bastards. Swollen, titanic farm animals burst through crumbling walls like <a href="https://youtu.be/Z4l39b1ESVs">they’re hungry for tamacco</a>, and a multi-armed sheep who will <strong>never skip leg day</strong> climbs between two buildings. A giant pig perched on its hind legs slowly turns to face the camera and our protagonists as they flee through a rotting wooden shack. There’s another beastie that eludes classification, scurrying about the trailer with limbs emerging from a vast cocoon.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Tarsier Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The look of the characters and monsters is “centered around the shared past of these kids,” says Mervik. Ah, there's that Silent Hill inspiration again. The story focuses on five orphans, but you’ll play as one of two: a girl in an ennui-wracked bunny mask, or a boy who presumably tried to find a bunny mask, failed, and just popped a sack on his head. Tarsier aren’t saying much about what these kids are up to, but it’ll be your job to find out.</p>
<p>When Mervik talks about the tones and themes of Reanimal, he uses words that evoke a malformed peacefulness and vitality. A comforting scent made repugnant, like someone pissed in your bread maker while you weren’t looking. Corruption. Distortion. Defilement. Violence. “The world itself? I’d say violent is the word I’d use most. What this world is - why it’s the way it is. What it reflects. It’s violence. Oh, it’s a lovely pine forest. How can we destroy that? There’s very industrial settings, and what should be a nice water forest…”</p>
<p>And it’s there Mervik veers off topic, slightly, to talk about the opportunities the new camera offers to compose scenes in new ways, to give the player a sense of loneliness. As someone trying to report on the game, I find the sudden shift a little jarring. But, as someone who loved both Little Nightmares games dearly, Mervik's excitement is contagious. It feels, despite the tangent, like a deeply focused and intentional project.</p>
<p>Tarsier have never been shy about trimming their designwork, to the point where you could criticise the Little Nightmares games for running a bit short for their asking prices. Short, but never truncated. Perfectly formed, and perfectly unsettling. Reanimal looks to carry on that tradition. I’ll be counting down the days, even if I don’t think counting sheep is going to work for me anymore.</p>

            <p>There are unexpected things in life, like when one of the recipes in my Gousto box (basically Hello Fresh) didn't come packed with a key ingredient: a single red pepper. Devastating, especially since it's only ever happened to me once. Anyway, this is a long but no less meaningful segue to a game from the Far: Changing Tides and Lone Sails devs Okomotive that's just been announced at this year's Geoffcom show. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> and it's nothing to do with sailing across a decaying universe, but very much to do with alpine expeditions and friendly beasts. Very unexpected.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As the name suggests, Herdling is a singleplayer game that sees you "guide, protect, and fall in love with a motley herd of Calicorns". Calicorns being these large bison-looking things. The journey will involve steering your furry pals through mountains, "fog-wreathed forests", valleys, and snowy plateaus, all while honing your herding ability.</p>
<p>While it's not quite clear what exactly is going to challenge your herding ability, the game does involve "threats" and "light environmental puzzles". By light puzzles, I imagine there will be a gaping hole and you'll need to tell your Calicorns to nudge a plank of wood to bridge the gap. I could also see there being a section where you'll need to steer them through a dangerous darkness towards patches of light, where the patches of light are safe spaces. Such is the way of video games: I would bet a Gousto box containing five meals on these things being true.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we know there are going to be "stampede sequences", which can only mean a rush of wind and some soaring strings to accompany the rush. I'm fully expecting Herdling to be an emotional hit, perhaps a bit like the Last Guardian, but where you develop an affinity with an entire family of fur babies.</p>
<p>Herdling is due out sometime in 2025 and you can find the game over on its Steam page.</p>

            <p>How's this for a Gamescom 2024 moment: Peter Molyneux is back, and he's making a new god sim. The game in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/masters-of-albion">Masters Of Albion</a>, which now has a page on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">Steam</a>. In development at Molyneux's 2012-founded studio 22cans, it looks like a mix of Populous and Black &amp; White with knocked-together, toylike visuals, and a loose tower-defence format whereby monsters attack your villages at night. Here's the first trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>"The story of Albion is one of power and consequence, a rich and deep narrative set in a world full of quests and moral choices," explains the announcement blurb. "Navigate your way through intrigue and plot - kings come and go, lords shake you by the hand then stab you in the back, and the people work like dogs and are treated no better.</p>
<p>"Gifted godlike, ancient powers, you face an enemy the likes of which have not been seen in hundreds of years," it continues. "Magic is returning to the hills and halls of Albion, threatening to tear down the very foundations of society. Unravel the mystery of the mages, defeat the enemy that lurks in the night and conquer a sorcery that could kill us all."</p>
<p>Here's what all that involves in practice: by day, you'll build and manage villages using an old school Bullfrog hand cursor with a definite air of mischief. By dint of dragging, dropping and zooming you'll oversee everything from the design of weapons (breadswords, not so effective) to the stacking of house segments (watch you don't drop them - this game has Real Physics) and the pegging out of roads and fortifications. </p>
<p>You'll also need to "fulfil orders from the vying factions - food for the people, clothes for the Lords, weapons and armour for the King". Town progression seems to revolve around the Arcanum, where you can trade favours for new blocks, product parts and magical powers.</p>
<p>After the sun goes down, it's time to play Splat The Undead. You can hire and control heroes to smack up the night creatures in person, or rain hell upon them from turrets, but it looks far more fun to fry them with spells from your hand cursor. Possessing heroes is also how you'll explore the game's open world, it seems, founding new villages and doing quests for treasures.</p>
<p>All told, this seems rather promising. It sounds mean-spirited, but I never thought I'd ever describe a new Molyneux game as promising in this, the year 2024. I particularly like the Wes Anderson-ish viewing perspective. To address the various elephants in the room, Masters Of Albion is conspicuously devoid of shady monetisation mechanics, and most of the features look perfectly achievable. No acorns of overpromising so far.</p>

<p>Netflix has revealed their multiplayer title set in the Squid Game universe, Squid Game: Unleashed. The title was first announced during Netflix’s <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> in July. Check out Squid Game: Unleashed’s Gamescom trailer below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Squid Game: Unleashed is an upcoming mobile gaming title that will be available exclusively through the Netflix App on iOS and Android devices. The title will feature 32-player, party royale gameplay, where you will team up with friends to get through several courses of deadly obstacles. The trailer showcased classic stages from the hit South Korean TV series and some new ones to add to the challenge. No release date was revealed, but according to their previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-multiplayer-squid-game-title-gets-2024-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, the game should arrive in 2024, </p>



<p>Squid Game is a South Korean dystopian survival thriller created by Hwang Dong-hyuk for Netflix and released in 2021. The plot revolves around hundreds of participants competing in children’s games for a hefty cash prize. However, if you lose, you are not only out of the competition but also lose your life. The first season still holds the record as Netflix’s most-watched season, and with season 2 arriving on December 26, 2024, the anticipation for Squid Game: Unleashed will be at an all-time high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Playground Productions has officially announced the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/backyard-sports-returns-with-franchise-revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backyard Sports</a> franchise for the first time in a decade.

However, "Arc" machines are trying to stop you, as are other human players.</p><p>Stefan Strandberg, the co-founder and creative director at Embark, said in a statement that Arc Raiders has "changed and evolved" over the course of its development. However, Strandberg said the game's world has remained unchanged.</p><p>"Our inspiration draws from current-day themes taken to their extreme, like the prospect of colonizing space, at a time when the relationship between man and machine is becoming increasingly fraught," Strandberg said.</p><p>For more from Gamescom Opening Night Live, be sure to check out all the biggest news in the gallery below.</p>

            <p>
Tonight brings a first look at the next game in the legendary Batman: Arkham series - the upcoming entry coming to Meta Quest 3.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> is a prequel story set before Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum, though after existing prequel entry Arkham Oranges. 
</p>
<p>
In first-person, you'll be able to do many of the things you could in those entries - including boshing your enemies in the face with your fists, grappling across gaps and using various other bat-gadgets, plus switching on Detective Vision.

<p>
Developed by Camouflaj, Arkham Shadow was announced earlier this year and is a canonical new entry in the Arkhamverse - one that perhaps feels more familiar than Rocksteady's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>.
</p>
<p>
As in Arkham Oranges, Roger Craig Smith plays Batman, with Troy Baker as Harvey Dent and Tara Strong as Dr Harleen Quinzel - earlier versions of Two Face and Harley Quinn you'll be crossing paths with.
</p>
<p>Tonight's trailer includes an October release window. Meta Quest 3 owners, will you be picking it up?</p>

            <p>
ARC Raiders - the free-to-play PvPvE extraction shooter from The Finals developer Embark Studios - has resurfaced following an extended period of retooling, and is now launching as a premium title for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 next year.
</p>
<p>
If you're struggling to remember much about ARC Raiders, that might be because few details have been shared since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ea-and-dice-exec-patrick-soderlund-teases-new-project">announcement back in 2021</a>. It was originally set to release in 2022, but its launch has continued to slip since then - first into 2023 so Embark could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-arc-raiders-delayed-into-2023">focus on The Finals</a>, and latterly while the studio continued to tinker with the title following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-from-ex-dice-devs-embark-studios-has-had-a-genre-change">genre change</a>.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out its switch from co-operative third-person shooter to PvPvE extraction shooter (its original form "wasn't really fun", Embark admitted during a recent press event) wasn't to be ARC Raiders' only notable change. It's now been re-announced as a $40 USD premium title - jettisoning its previous free-to-play form, albeit while still remaining a live-service game.

<p>
Storywise, ARC Raiders catapults players into a "post-post-apocalyptic" future where humanity has fled underground to escape the ARC machines roaming the world's surface. However, resources found up top remain in high demand, which is where players - cast as a Raiders - come in. It's up to you and your squad (Arc Raiders can be played solo or in teams of up to three) to explore the world above - visiting one of its multiple large-scale maps each run - and gather resources. Success requires fending off ARC machines and other squads of players to make it back to the underground colony of Speranza alive.

Failure results in the loss of all items gathered during a mission (with some exceptions), but success means players can trade their loot and valuables with Speranza's locals. Speranza also serves as a hub where quests can be gathered, player's chambers can be upgraded and expanded, and their characters can be evolved to suit their preferred playstyle.
</p>
<p>
"Whether teaming up or going solo, it's a game that rewards thinking ahead and carefully observing the world around you, rather than running into action guns blazing," Embark says of its reworked shooter. "The gameplay is tactile, visceral, and grounded, with a rich and playful sandbox of gadgets and tools, beyond just guns and ammo."

<p>
Talking to press during its ARC Raiders re-reveal, Embark wouldn't be drawn on what these "gadgets and tools" might be, but hinted things like the zipline featured in its new trailer aren't just there for show. The studio also isn't quite ready to talk social features yet, choosing to sidestep a question inquiring about the likes of clans and guilds, but it <em>has</em> teased some of its post-launch live-service plans, saying players can expect existing areas of the world to expand and evolve over time, with brand-new areas set to be introduced too.
</p>
<p>
This new premium PvPvE iteration of ARC Raiders is set to get its first public Tech Test on Steam from 24th-27th October - and interested parties can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">sign up now</a>. The full game will be available on Steam, Epic, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S when it launches next year.

		<p>Starfield is getting two updates and the first is the free Rev-8 vehicle that will be available right about now. “Now is your chance to explore new frontiers (and reach new heights) in your very own land cruiser,” say Bethesda,</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Official REV-8 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1z1DbA_Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We also got an release date for the Shattered Space DLC and that will be out on September 30th 2024.&nbsp; There’s some decidedly spooky vibes to the DLC and trailer, with a mysterious power stirring the city of Dazra on House Va-runn’s hidden homeworld – this will be a big new area to explore akin to the other capital planets in the base game. Here you’ll investigate a new cosmic threat, explore a brand new planet and find new weapons, spacesuits, and gear.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Shattered Space - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNM1HFzQC8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“The home planet of House Va’ruun remains a mystery to the vast majority of the citizens of the Settled Systems,” say Bethesda. “The religious zealots that make up this clandestine faction are known only by their dangerous reputation. When a distress signal originating from a derelict star station leads you on a path to Va’ruun’kai, you’ll begin to uncover the secrets surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent. Explore a new location, take on new enemies and experience the story of House Va’ruun when Shattered Space launches later this year.”</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/06/starfield-review-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a look </a>at Starfield when it was released and this is what Stefan had to say:</p>
<p>“Skyrim and Fallout 4 had a space baby and named it Starfield. As with every child, there’s the hope that it will better its parents as it grows into adulthood, and from the time spent with Starfield, I’d say it’s right up there with Bethesda’s best. I’ve certainly enjoyed what I’ve seen so far and the new setting, but there’s just no getting away from the fact that it has its mother’s eyes and its dad’s nose.”</p>

		<p>Capcom has shared a good long look at Monster Hunter Wilds for Gamescom Opening Night Live, featuring plenty of big beastie battling. Monster Hunter Wilds is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 3rd Trailer | Lala Barina &amp; Scarlet Forest Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp4gR1QEvVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The third trailer for the game revealed the new Scarlet Forest locale, introduced us to battles with the Lala Barina, as well as the apex predator, the Rey Dau. Oh, and of course there was some new ways to cook and camp on show. Everybody loves cooking in games.</p>
<p>Capcom recently ran through the gamut of weapons and abilities that you’ll have available to you with a series of short and pithy individual video trailers – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-focus-mode-seikret-slinger-wirebug/">see the first of those here</a>.</p>
<p>Players will have access to new gadgets and companions like the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment.</p>
<p>And you have Focus Mode, a new mechanic and combat technique, letting you aim your attacks and guards more precisely. They will now go in the direction the camera is facing, giving you more manual control. Focus Mode will highlight wounds on monsters, which you’ll then want to directly target to deal extra damage. It also enables Focus Strikes, which are particular special attacks.</p>
