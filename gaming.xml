<p>Much like its predecessors (and, indeed, its successors), <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is a turn-based strategy RPG in which you'll be issuing commands to your characters and trying to keep them alive throughout various combat scenarios.</p><p>The game features permadeath, so if any of your troops fall during a battle, they're gone for good. Even plot-critical characters can fall in this way, although they'll be gravely wounded rather than dead, so you'll still see them during cutscenes.</p><p><em>Path of Radiance </em>is the first <em>Fire Emblem </em>game to feature fully-rendered 3D graphics, as well as voice acting and FMV cutscenes, but it's not the first title to come to the West; that honor goes to 2003's eponymous <em>Fire Emblem </em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a7f1d4bf-fa55-4e28-a6da-a9eb0190b12d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also on Switch Online!</a>).</p><p>You can check out a trailer for <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>'s Switch Online release right here. The trailer's in Japanese, but the game is available across the world, so you won't exclusively be playing the Japanese version.</p>
<p><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance </em>is available right now to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack addon. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Larian Studios, the team behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span>, is holding a Reddit AMA right now in which it talks about everything from its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429"><span>highly publicized use of genAI</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-switch-2-port-reddit-ama-2000658454"><span>likely-dead dream of a Switch 2 port</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. It is also talking about lessons it’s learned in its 30 years, and one thing it took away from </span><i><span>BG3 </span></i><span>is clear: Companions should ease into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>being horny</span></a><span> rather than professing their love for you very quickly.</span></p> <p><span>In the AMA, senior writer Kevin VanOrd responded to a question about what Larian would like to improve on, and he gave two encouraging answers: companions having deeper, more complex relationships with each other, and a much slower lead-in to romantic relationships than in previous games.</span></p> <p><span>“Companion relationships,” he wrote. “Firstly, to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players. Secondly, to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</span></p> <p><span>Putting aside the horny ramp for a second, the distinction VanOrd makes between deeper companion relationships and more banter is an important one. I’ve been replaying </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, and one thing BioWare really cooked with in that game is that your party is very clearly establishing their own relationships and dynamics with each other, regardless of your input and presence. Some of those result in romantic relationships, others solidify platonic ones with shared interests that go beyond the ambient dialogue you’ll hear running through the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I just stumbled upon an early cutscene of the detective Neve and the elven archeologist Bellara bonding over their shared love of detective stories, and </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>could have definitely used more moments like that to help dispel the feeling that party members are living on islands and largely separate from each other. Shadowheart and Lae’zel were better about this than most pairings in </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, as their violent rivalry became mutual respect, so Larian’s definitely got it in them.</span></p> <p><span>That horny ramp-up, though; I’m sure anyone who felt like Gale or Halsin were too forward in </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> will be glad to know Larian wants to rectify this in </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span>. The studio has since said that characters’ quick confessions of love were initially a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-d-d-companions-relationship-horny-bug-1850801750"><span>glitch in the game’s approval system</span></a><span>, but even after a patch, it hasn’t stopped folks from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-party-gale-wyll-1850729525"><span>associating </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>with its horned-up camp crew</span></a><span>. The RPG’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-sex-scene-romance-intimacy-halsin-gale-1850865892"><span>high-production sex scenes</span></a><span> have solidified it as one of the more mainstream “horny” games on the market, so it’s good to know Larian is cognizant of the criticism and wants to address it in future games.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-rpg-larian-bg3-loot-coop-2000658437</link>
            <guid>1401754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New information continues to trickle out about Larian Studios’ next RPG thanks to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">January AMA</a> held with some of the development team’s leads on Reddit. The game is in full production and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> maker is exploring timing around when to show off the first snippets of actual gameplay. In the meantime, we have plenty of morsels to chew on from the latest Q&amp;A, including comments on co-op, companion romances, and a possible Switch 2 port. Here’s everything new we just learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">about <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p> <h2>Hand-crafted loot could return</h2> <p>Loot in<em> Divinity: Original Sin 1</em> and <em>2</em> was random, but Larian wants to do something more like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> for<em> Divinity</em>. “The <em>BG3</em> approach of handcrafting every magic item worked well, and it’s something we’ve always wanted to do for&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em>,” head of design Nick Pechenin wrote. “Something we realized when working on randomized loot for <em>DOS1</em> and <em>DOS2</em> is that fully random loot is frequently confusing, so we added more and more rules and premade patterns to make it feel more intentional. In the end randomization did not save us much time.”</p>

 <h2>It’ll be made in the same engine as <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></h2> <p>Larian will continue iterating on its existing Divinity Engine for the next game. It’s not suddenly moving to Unreal like some other RPG studios.</p> <h2>Native keyboard movement controls?</h2> <p>Head of gameplay Artem Titov simply wrote “no.”</p> <h2>Of course <em>Divinity</em> will be co-op</h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of previous games, the next RPG will also be multiplayer at release. “The amount of players playing together will be depending on the final party size,” wrote scripting director Bert Stevens. “But since modding is planned for this project as well, player[s] will be essentially free to extend this. There is no hard limit to the amount of coop players.”</p>

 <h2>The goal with gameplay is to “embrace the chaos”</h2> <p>For players who love doing quests out of order and blazing their own path through a game, <em>Divinity</em> will continue Larian’s reputation for accommodating the weirdest player idiosyncrasies. “The first thing we tend to do when playtesting our own situations is run them out of sequence, break them in every conceivable way, and see how far we can push the boundaries of what’s possible,” wrote writing director Adam Smith. “The greatest joy I get is seeing somebody go so far off the beaten path that they assume we’ll have lost track of them, and then they stumble across something that we put there just for them.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> might have swimming?</h2> <p>One fan asked Larian which new <em>Divinity</em> mechanic it was most proud of and Pechenin gave a cryptic answer. “There was something that bothered me when I explored the starting areas of <em>DOS1</em>, <em>DOS2</em> and<em> BG3</em>,” he wrote. “It stares you right in the face if you think about it. In <em>Divinity</em> I can finally do the thing I wanted to do in every previous game.” Considering all three games start near a beach, some players think he’s talking about finally being able to hop into the water.</p>

 <h2>It’s ditching the magic armor system</h2> <p><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> introduced a new mechanic to the series by which armor for physical and magic damage were separate. That will, thank god, not be returning in <em>Divinity</em>. “There will be ways to protect your characters from harm, but you will not have to wait before you can use your fun skill on enemies,” Pechenin wrote. “We are still cooking a system that makes sure that you have to work harder to stunlock solo bosses with level 1 skills, but it won’t be tied to damage.”</p>

 <h2>What about the tone?</h2> <p>The debut cinematic trailer was extremely grim and R-rated. Will the rest of the game follow in that vein? According to Smith,<em> Divinity</em> definitely aims to be more “grounded” and embrace some “folk horror vibes,” but will also still have plenty of humor, tragedy, and other emotional beats. “I laughed out loud reviewing a dialogue this morning!” he wrote. “I mentioned in the answer to another question that a game this size needs lots of tonal diversity.”</p>

 <h2>How will the camera work in&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>?</h2> <p>“The camera will work very similar as in <em>BG3</em>,” Stevens confirmed. “So a hybrid of top-down and 3rd person camera!”</p> <h2>Will<em> Divinity</em> finally let you look up at the sky?</h2> <p>Probably not. “There is no real engine limitation to allow looking at the sky,” Stevens wrote. “How the camera works is entirely a design choice. Alternative camera angles are always considered. If they benefit the game, we will for sure add it.”</p> <h2><em>Divinity</em> is a standalone story rather than a direct sequel to <em>Original Sin 2</em></h2> <p>While <em>Original Sin 2</em> retconned some of the series’ previous lore, the new game will take place in that world but tell a separate story. “It’s in the same continuity, but it’s a standalone story,” Smith confirmed. “Long-term <em>Divinity</em> fans will find lots of familiar things but it’s never just fanservice – it has to serve the story we’re telling.”</p>

 <h2>Companions will have deeper relationships with each other this time around</h2> <p><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was great at deep relationships between the player and their party, but less so between the individual companions. More interesting relationships between party members is a priority for <em>Divinity</em>. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd wrote that the team wants “to have more interaction between companions – not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players.”</p> <h2>And be less aggressively horny…</h2> <p>He wrote that the other main goal with the companion writing this time around is “to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural.”</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em> on Switch 2 is being considered but not promised</h2> <p>“We love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next <em>Divinity</em> game,” Stevens wrote.</p> <h2>Lizard romance?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylpp1p/">Confirmed</a>.</p>

                <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke, as well as creative directors, recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">participated in an AMA on Reddit</a> to set expectations for the studio’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/">upcoming Divinity game</a>, particularly about its stance on generative AI--a hot-button topic in the industry right now. Responding to a fan question about the role of generative AI in game development, Vincke was rather blunt: "There is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity."</p><p>His comments arrive amid wider debate over how and whether AI should be used in creative processes, especially as some high-profile games have faced backlash for such use. One notable example is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the acclaimed RPG that had two Indie Game Awards (including Game of the Year and Debut Game) rescinded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">when it was revealed the title had included AI-generated assets</a> during development, violating strict no-AI rules--even though those assets were patched out later.</p><p>In the AMA, Vincke acknowledged that previous discussions about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">experimenting with AI tools for concept-art had been confusing</a>. To make its intentions clear, the studio has elected to avoid generative AI entirely in concept-art creation for Divinity. As Vincke put it, there should be no doubt about where the art came from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5lWeGhq2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kz5lWeGhq2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We've decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept-art development. That way, there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," Vinke replied. "Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better, in general, the gameplay is. We think GenAI can help with this, and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game."</p><p>Vinke did note that the creative assets will not be generated from outside. If an AI model is used to create something, it will be trained on data or art that Larian itself owns.</p><p>Fans weren't done there, though: A follow-up question asked whether the no-AI stance applied only to concept-art, or if it extended to other creative areas such as writing. They also pointed out previous mentions of using AI for placeholder text and wondered whether such use could undesirably influence final content. Larian's writing director, Adam Smith, responded: "The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries, or other writing in Divinity."</p><p>Smith went further in explaining that using AI to generate placeholder text offered no real benefit after working with a model. "We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best, and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts--and there are a lot of them--are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous."</p><p>Earlier last year, in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a>, Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do," doubling down on using it only for quickening the workflow. There is no release date yet for Divinity, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/"> Larian</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/" data-ref-id="1100-6537029"> is feeling the pressure</a> on how to follow up on the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>

            <guid>1401739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you plan on staying out for longer than five hours with a cell phone, you have a power bank. For the most part, these things are boring bricks. Though they keep trying to add new features (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/856225/power-banks-are-the-latest-victims-of-feature-creep?ref=aftermath.site"><u>many of I will concede are useless</u></a>), the most exciting features are “will it charge my phone?” followed by “how much?” and maybe “how fast?” But, being me, I asked myself “how far can these things be pushed?”, which is how I ended up purchasing the humorously named Cuktech 15 Ultra, an attractive and modestly priced little brick that unfortunately has one incredibly sick feature that has now ruined me forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Cuktech, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1nru4ev/cuktech_visit/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which I believe is named</u></a> after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86uk_converter?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ćuk converter</u></a> and is pronounced “chook tech,” makes well-made gear. The Cuktech 15 Ultra boasts a capacity of 20,000 mAh, has a bright and beautiful screen that displays the charging speed of each port, and claims to have 140w output which is generally overkill but nice if you have a MacBook Pro (The highest end iPhone currently caps out at 40w tops, which is fairly fast for most people.). USB-C charging standards are annoying to keep straight and are only interesting if you have a bizarre obsession. What makes the 15 Ultra interesting is not that it has a high output, but that it has a mode dubbed “Beast Mode” that it claims allows for two simultaneous inputs of up to 165 watts (the internal meter capped at around 160w for me) for the majority of the time plugged in before it starts ramping down.</p><p>What this means is that, given adequate cables and bricks, the Cuktech 15 Ultra charges fast. Like, concerningly fast.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbwmhtwh222z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigen5agpgbecr4bfrjoeo4ucn4xftpujlvrtgcyywj7jj6khe5gs4"><p lang="en">Currently testing how fast I can charge my USB-C power bank.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3mbwmhtwh222z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-08T18:30:49.217Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Let's see how fast this bad boy can go.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It should be noted that other power banks do actually do this, albeit at a way higher price point. Anker has a power bank that will take two inputs at a claimed maximum input of 240 watts, but that bank costs $200. I don’t know about you, but I don’t make $200 power bank money, but I do make $60 power bank money on a good day, which is what the 15 Ultra costs as of this writing. You will also need a few sufficiently fast chargers and cables if you wanna make the most of it. That’s an additional cost, but one that’s easier for me to swallow because I need those anyway for my various gadgets and gizmos. Having a spare GaN charger or two that can handle a total output of 100w or 140w is always useful.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbwn3yaggk2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihjld5eyzj2pwqv3m3rsfa2jwj72sjw3scamrngtmjltptwyxzrje"><p lang="en">12 minutes later.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3mbwn3yaggk2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-08T18:42:04.827Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Woooooooo.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Beast Mode or any disarmingly fast charging mode so refreshing is that it completely saves your ass if you are a deeply lazy or neurologically distractible person. Repeatedly I find myself in the following situation: my phone is hovering at like 36 percent, my power bank is empty, and I have to leave in 15-20 minutes. Once I get the correct number of chargers going, 15-20 minutes is precisely as much time as I need to dump a huge amount of juice into the power bank along with my phone. It is not that the charging feature saves a lot of time, but the time it saves is in the exact right place.</p><p>I should stress that this is not a rigorous testing of the parameters of the required charging cables, power adapters, safety and advertised battery duration of the Cucktech 15 Ultra. Lithium Ion batteries are complicated and that is long, tedious work that I respect. I do know the exact power testers to buy on Aliexpress if I ever decide to make that a thing for Aftermath, and maybe I will down the line.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I actually kinda dig the display! It's not bad.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I do, however, regularly visit the blogs of guys who consistently do this kind of testing. <a href="https://www.chargerlab.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chargerlab</u></a> and its more consistently updated Chinese language site <a href="https://www.chongdiantou.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chongdiantou</u></a> do teardowns and regular updates about new charging gear coming out of China, and it’s a fun way to see what’s on the horizon. There’s a German person named <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargingSheet/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chargingsheet who has their own subreddit</u></a> devoted to USB chargers and cables who was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChargingSheet/comments/1ii7vse/cuktech_15_ultra_210w_20000_mah_powerbank_mit/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>impressed by the 15 Ultra</u></a> (although found it to be a little large). <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-cables?ref=aftermath.site"><u>TinkerVault’s</u></a> testing of <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-power-sources?ref=aftermath.site"><u>chargers</u></a> and <a href="https://www.tinkervault.com/usb-cables?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cables</u></a> is useful when trying to find good gear, and it was very useful when trying to find enough juice to max out the Cuktech 15 Ultra.</p><p>This blog is not simply me endorsing the Cuktech 15 Ultra specifically – it’s well made enough, a very good deal for the features and comes with a nice cable. But there’s like five million charger brands out there right now. What I am marveling at is a feature that I expect will become standardized more and more in the future: the ability to crank as much juice as you can into a battery pack in the shortest time possible. Is charging a personal battery pack that fast a good idea? Is that hubris? Who can say. All I know is I have a learning disability that this helps with and the battery pack makes a really cool warp speed animation when you <em>really </em>get that sucker goin’.</p>

            <guid>1401721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee271c23347b8"><a title="My Mario Marketing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee271c23347b8/my-mario-marketing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-is-bringing-the-my-mario-line-to-the-west-in-february">bringing its 'My Mario' collection to the West</a> next month. It launched a cute new marketing campaign showing happy parents and young children putting the products to the test, but the images quickly set AI alarm bells ringing for many on social media (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-my-mario-generative-ai/">The Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>You see, in a lot of the promotional images, commenters online thought that the fingers just don't add up. One model's thumb appears bent back to an impossible angle, while another hand holding up a toddler has been criticised for its finger length and placement.</p>
<p>Hands and fingers have been used as something of a Gen-AI litmus test in recent years, with the software's difficulties in accurately portraying their position (or quantity) becoming a telltale sign of whether an image is the real deal. Such an approach seems to have been applied to Nintendo's new campaign, with the big reveal on <a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620">Twitter</a> being met with a tidal wave of replies accusing the company of resorting to "AI slop" in its marketing.</p>

<p>But things aren't as clean-cut this time around. While that thumb is undoubtedly looking a little funky, there's every chance that we're looking at nothing more than a post-shoot editing mix-up — and, to our eyes, the other hands look perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, several users have come to Nintendo's <em>defence</em> following the AI accusations. "I know the hands may look weird but that's what hands do lol," one user wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eternazrael.bsky.social/post/3mbwkyxp3os2r">Bluesky</a>, "I [swear to god] we've gotten to the point where if you bend your hand in a weird way it's automatically ai".</p>

<p>We ran all four of the images used in the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS" tabindex="-1">@NintendoStoreUS</a> reveal tweet through both the <a href="https://notegpt.io/ai-image-detector">NoteGBT</a> and <a href="https://decopy.ai/ai-image-detector/">Decopy</a> AI image detectors (which may use the same analysis software) with differing results. The much-discussed 'weird thumb' picture was said to have a 63.84% to 82% chance that it used some form of AI generation, while the other three came in at &gt;1%. Another detector, <a href="https://www.zerogpt.com/ai-image-detector">ZeroGBT</a>, concluded that the thumb picture had a 3% chance of being AI-generated, while the others had a 97% chance of being digitally edited. So big pinches of salt all round.</p>
<p>Of course, digital editing with Photoshop and the like is a completely standard practice for basically any marketing image these days. Almost every Nintendo promo will likely undergo <em>some kind of</em> post-shoot editing, and there's every chance that these wonky digits are just a byproduct of that.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Nintendo of America for a comment, and we will update this post as soon as we hear anything back.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-says-ai-generated-images-were-not-used-in-mario-kart-world">Nintendo has been accused of using AI-generated images</a> in its products. Back in May, a company spokesperson told Eurogamer that "AI-generated images were not used in the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>", after an online theory suspected the Switch 2 launch title of relying on AI placeholders for many of its billboards and signs.</p>
<p>Miyamoto has previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-to-go-in-different-direction-to-current-ai-trends-says-miyamoto">stated</a> that Nintendo would "rather go in a different direction" than the rest of the industry when it comes to the use of AI in game development.</p>

			<p>Valve's reveal of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">was one of 2025's biggest announcements</a>, and while players are excited about the potential of the new GabeCube, one question has hovered above the new hardware like a dark cloud (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">that grows even darker with memory shortage complications</a>): <strong>how much will the Steam Machine cost?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we don't yet have official pricing, but a leak from a Czech retailer may have just provided our first indication as to what the latest gaming box will cost. Shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingnewsandleaks/comments/1q88b1u/grain_of_salt_steam_machine_price_leaked_1000_for/">Reddit's GamingLeaksandRumors page by user chusskaptaan</a>, a third-party Czech retailer known as <a href="https://www.smarty.cz/Valve-Steam-Machine-512GB-4p249960">Smarty.cz has a live listing for the Steam Machine</a>, featuring two different models.</p>



<p>The first is a <strong>512GB</strong> model, which, according to the website's source code, seems to cost <strong>19,826 CZK</strong>, or approximately <strong>$950 USD</strong>. The other model is a <strong>2TB</strong> version, and it seems to be listed at <strong></strong><strong>22,305 CZK</strong>, or <strong>$1,070 USD.</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that these prices are estimates based on a conversion from Czech Koruna, and as the post itself notes, third-party retailers could have their own markups, which means the actual retail price of the machine from Valve could very well be lower.</p>



<p>That said, while Valve hasn't made any official announcements about the price, it's been made <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">clear from multiple sides of the tech industry that prices on hardware will increase</a> due to the current memory crisis, and when Valve was asked <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">if the company would be subsidizing the price of its new box</a>, the answer was a flat no.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market</em>," began software engineer at Valve, Pierre-Loup Griffais. "<em></em><em>Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is."</em></p>



<p>So while we've seen pricing estimates from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">creators like LinusTechTips who've tried to guess at what the cost of the new box would be</a> and found that it might not be too expensive, the reality might not be as kind. Still, for what the Steam Machine could be capable of, paying a little more than $1k for it is arguably still a good deal, when you consider the freedom of choice you get with a Steam Machine versus a traditional console or the cost of building your own PC.</p>



<p>As for when we could hear official words from Valve on the price, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/"> latest reports point to a <strong>Spring 2026</strong> release</a>, and if that's true, then we'll know sooner than later what the actual price will be. </p>

<figcaption>We don't know much about the upcoming <em>Divinity</em>, but we know it probably won't be free of generative AI.</figcaption>

<p>Vincke says Larian won't use what he calls "creative assets" without "being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data". He says if generative AI is used to create assets, it will be "trained on data [Larian owns]".</p><p>There is, however, a question mark (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/twilightvulpine.bsky.social/post/3mbypouyzb22c" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">pointed out by one Bluesky user</a>) around whether such a thing is possible; it's likely that any gen AI model used by Larian will be based on pre-existing models, which have often been trained on data of questionable origin.</p><p>The generative AI debate continues to rage in the gaming sphere. Some companies, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="19d43f27-7ba5-4ecd-92ba-6d04beac862a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have wholeheartedly embraced it, while others, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Manor Lords </em>publisher Hooded Horse</a>, have denounced the tech in no uncertain terms.</p><p>Generative AI isn't going anywhere anytime soon, though, it seems; our very own Don's research has revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost 20% of Steam's top sellers in 2025</a> used generative AI in some way, shape, or form.</p><figure role="group">

You can grab one for yourself right now without having to spend a ridiculous amount of money,</p>

            <guid>1401703</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Computer components are getting pretty pricey. So if you’re looking to buy any or a whole computer, you’re going to have to be pretty selective. And when you spot a deal, it’s a good idea to grab it while you can. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor was designed specifically for people who want a fast and responsive computer. If that’s you, you can snag a serious deal on it right now, because we’ve found one you won’t want to miss out on.</p>
<p>You can currently purchase the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor on Amazon.com for $252 (down from $399) which represents a savings of $147 and 37% off of the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful processor with a significant discount</h2>
<p>The processor features eight performance cores and sixteen threads so that it can process high refresh rate gaming, streaming, and content creation without your entire computer slowing down. If you’re building a new PC or updating your existing computer with a new processor, then the Ryzen 7 7700X would be a solid option to ensure that your computer stays as fast as possible as it can while components continue to evolve and improve over the years.</p>
<p>You can enter high-end games, have voice chat and/or a browser active, and even begin recording/streaming your gameplay without losing FPS. These additional threads prove to be valuable when your system is operating the logic of a game, as well as background applications and capture software all at one time. This processor provides you with the room needed to perform these tasks without constantly adjusting settings.</p>



<p>In addition to gaming, if you use various creative applications, then the number of cores and speeds found within the Ryzen 7 7700X will greatly benefit those applications. For example, tasks such as video editing, converting video files, batch photo processing, and working in 3D applications, all function much quicker than processors with fewer cores. Your exports will complete faster, your timeline will scrub faster, and you will not be forced to stare at the “progress bar” when you would rather be creating your next project. This type of upgrade will pay for itself daily if you spend time in creative applications.</p>
<p>You can couple this processor with current graphics cards, high-speed storage, and multiple monitors without your CPU becoming the bottleneck before you know it. This processor is an excellent option for a system that you intend to keep and possibly expand upon over the course of several years.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">Overall, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor is an easy recommendation if you want a fast, versatile PC</a>. At this lowest price, you really can’t go wrong with grabbing this deal while it’s still available. Be sure you don’t miss it, and get ready for enjoying all your favorite games as the year kicks off.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s big Season One Reloaded update has taken place, which features a host of Fallout collab content, including a variety of Operator Skins to claim.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 provides a host of in-game content across a variety of game modes, though the most eye-catching additions are the Operator Skins bringing some of the famous characters from the Amazon TV series into the game.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to get your hands on all of the Fallout Operator Skins in Black Ops 7, Insider Gaming has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-x-fallout-operator-skins">All Black Ops 7 x Fallout Operator Skins</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New looks. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Five Fallout-themed Operator Skins landed alongside the Black Ops 7 Season One Reloaded update on January 8, two of which are available for free.</strong></p>



<p>The majority of the Fallout collab items in Black Ops 7 are available in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-fallout-event-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Pass</a>, with half of the rewards, including two Operator Skins, available to all players for free.</p>



<p>The other half of the Event Pass requires purchasing the Upgrade Track, which is where the other three Operator Skins, featuring recognizable characters from the TV show, are found.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the Black Ops 7 Operator Skins from the Fallout collab and how to get them.</p>

<p><strong>The Event Pass is not the only way to obtain Fallout cosmetics in Black Ops 7, and a Lucy MacLean Operator Skin will be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>However, Lucy MacLean will require an additional purchase, as the skin is being introduced in a shop bundle, though the exact price and release date were not revealed in the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>.</p>

Julian Gerighty, who oversees the franchise as executive producer, says the game is "shaping up to be a monster."</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">interview at the New Game+ Showcase</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-says-producer/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Gerighty opened up just a bit about the next major installment in the online action-RPG series. "The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced," Gerighty said.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian has changed its stance on generative AI following backlash faced at the end of last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">In a Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> hosted by the studio this afternoon, founder Swen Vincke said, "to ensure there is no room for doubt, we've decided to refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development". "That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>It was the use of gen-AI in relation to concept art that people had been especially concerned about. Vincke, in an interview in December, which coincided with the studio's Divinity game reveal, seemed to suggest Larian was using gen-AI to develop concept art. Controversy erupted, prompting Vincke to clarify that information had been "lost in translation", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">the studio was only using gen-AI to explore references for concept art</a>, not generate the images themselves.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the few weeks since, a decision has been made to remove all sources of ambiguity entirely. As if to reinforce this, Vincke's Reddit post led with: "there is not going to be any gen-AI art in Divinity". But the ambiguity hasn't been entirely dispersed.</p><p>Vincke said Larian is still exploring gen-AI use in other applications at the studio. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out," he wrote. "The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is. We think gen-AI can help with this and so we're trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p>
<p>"The important bit to note," he added, "is that we will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a gen-AI model to create in-game assets, then it'll be trained on data we own."</p>
<p>Larian lead writer Adam Smith joined the thread to clarify that the 'no gen-AI' approach to art would also be true for writing in Divinity. "The stance applies to writing as well," he wrote. "We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Divinity was announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a dark and gory cinematic trailer showing a festival - centred around burning someone at the stake - going horribly, irrevocably wrong. It shares the same series name as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 1 and 2, of course, but it's a completely new, detached game, and Larian is cooking up a new turn-based RPG system for it.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/09/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>1401673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a> is not the best version of the game. We might as well make that the starting point for a review that puts me in a very difficult position. How do you rate a game that’s as good as Rogue Trader, but which runs here, somewhat inexplicably, like a bag of spanners? You could just skip right down to the bottom of the page, but here’s the thing, Rogue Trader on Nintendo Switch 2 defies whatever score I finally settle on, because even when it’s running badly, it’s one of the best tactical RPG experiences you’ll find anywhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Nintendo Switch 2 Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWBf_Nk9TfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Load times are not good. That starts with the tone-setting creep of a loading bar that laughably shoots to 41% before taking a loooonnnng rest, searching around for the energy to make it to the end. Any movement from major area to the next brings about another lengthy wait, but the central sections themselves don’t incur any loading at all, so there is that. Travelling in your Voidship across the map also causes various stops and starts as different narrative moments are played out, a fresh load cycle happening every time despite those moments taking place in the same bridge section, and it serves to sap a lot of the game’s momentum.</p>


<p>You’ll be slowed down further when the game autosaves, pausing the action for at least ten seconds while it sorts itself out, and if you run quickly back and forth through a new area, the game will hang as it loads the required assets in. It’s then absolutely fine once it’s finished doing so, so it’s almost worth having a run around for a few moments to settle things down. All of this doesn’t sound very good, and… it’s not, requiring players to have rather more patience than most games should given that we now have SSD speeds for storage on Switch 2.</p>


<p>However, Rogue Trader is the kind of game to attract the patient. This is a role-playing game in the purest sense. From the first moments spent creating your character, where you’re choosing their background and backstory as well as selecting their visual design, you’re then drawn ever deeper into the world of Warhammer 40,000 thanks to some of the best writing and storytelling you’ll find in gaming.</p>
<p>If you’ve been a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, and perhaps read some of the many novelisations, Rogue Trader feels utterly authentic, perfectly capturing the language, lore and feel of Games Workshop’s sci-fi series. It’s intensely literary, with a great deal of excellent writing, and the size of the text has thankfully been enlarged for the Switch 2 edition, so it’s still enjoyable whether you’re playing in docked or handheld mode. There should definitely be a toggle or a slider for this, mind you, but I can live with it as it is.</p>
<p>That writing is enhanced by the excellent voice acting that’s prevalent across the entirety of the cast. Each character feels unique and fully formed, and as your crew expands, you’ll find yourself coming to know each of them in exceptional detail. It’s at a level that you’ll consistently marvel at, and despite the many performance issues in this version of the game, you can definitely look past them thanks to the quality of the actual game itself.</p>

<p>That will depend on how sensitive you are to frame rate issues, though. While things have improved following the first major patch, Rogue Trader on Switch 2 still chugs along when you’re moving around each area, and it’s incredibly inconsistent. Frankly, it looks and feels pretty horrible, and that’s with an obviously reduced resolution across the board as well, which makes the character models and level design look considerably uglier than you’ll find on other platforms.</p>
<p>You might be disappointed to find that following the most recent patch, they’ve also broken the menus. You can access the main options, but none of the graphical or visual options currently work, which feels as though it’s a deliberate choice while they try to improve things. There were previously two different anti-aliasing options, as well as a film grain toggle, but right now, none of it works. I do expect Owlcat to continue working on this, but in its current form, Rogue Trader on Switch 2 looks and feels more like it’s running on the original Switch.</p>

<p>The shame of all this is that Switch 2 owners are going to experience the game in a way that they may find utterly off-putting. They will check out from one of the best sci-fi RPGs of recent years, and that is tantamount to being a crime. The storytelling, the character building and the tactical combat are some of the best in the genre, but right now, this version of the game is a mess. It is broadly playable – I’m still persevering as the game has got its hooks back in me – but currently, if you can play Rogue Trader anywhere else, you should.</p>

			<p>The emulator just got even more simplified, which will make it convenient to run games directly from the ISO files. </p>



<h2 id="h-iso-based-disc-loading-comes-to-rpcs3-emulator-but-only-decrypted-isos-are-supported">ISO-Based Disc Loading Comes to RPCS3 Emulator, But Only Decrypted ISOs Are Supported</h2>



<p>The popular PlayStation 3 emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-removes-amd-rx-400-500-and-nvidia-gtx-900-1000-series-from-recommended-gpu-requirements/">RPCS3</a>, just got a big update. Usually, one would need to extract the contents of the game ISO files to allow RPCS3 to run the game, but the new update just eliminated this step. Contributor <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Functionable </em>submitted the code, which removes a long-standing inconvenience for users who had to extract the disc images into folders to run the game. </p>



<p>This might look small on paper, but it is pretty meaningful and has several benefits. While the existing method of extracting the ISO files is reliable, it requires nearly double the storage, assuming the user doesn't delete the original ISO file. The new update allows loading the disc games directly from the ISO file and no longer needs manual extraction. So, not just one step less, but also no additional storage required.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RPCS3 now supports loading disc games from ISO files, thanks to code submitted by Functionable! Note that only decrypted ISO loading is supported for now, encrypted ISO loading is not yet supported. Loading disc games from folders continues to be supported without any changes.</p>



<p>- RPCS3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that the developers have announced that this will only apply to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"decrypted" </strong>ISOs, and any encrypted ISO images that are directly dumped from retail PS3 discs won't run. PlayStation 3 already possesses the hardware and firmware-based encryption pipeline to decrypt discs, but RPCS3 does not. Also, the older method of extracting the ISO will still work like before, and those who have already maintained an organized folder-based library shouldn't worry. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-odyssey-gaming-monitors-32-g50d-series-hits-an-all-time-low-at-42-off-2000658292</link>
            <guid>1401655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. It’s where your favorite characters come to life, and if your screen is lagging or just failing to deliver the visuals your games deserve, it’s time to look for a better option.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this upgrade doesn’t have to blow your budget today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">You can currently grab the 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D gaming monitor for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 42% off its usual (and not-so-friendly) $430 price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this display drop to, ever. Just note that offers this good tend to wrap up fast. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Gameplay</h2>
<p>The screen features QHD resolution that packs in roughly 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for an exceptional picture quality. The IPS panel keeps the visuals bright and vibrant, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle ensures clarity from any viewpoint. It’s especially helpful when you’re playing with friends, since not everyone needs to sit directly in front of the screen to see what’s happening. Additionally, VESA DisplayHDR 400 focuses on delivering better contrast with deeper blacks and prominent whites. You will be able to spot bad guys hiding in the shadows, plus explore cool in-game environments more clearly in daylight scenes. This level of depth also helps titles feel closer to reality for an immersive experience that makes you feel a part of the game.</p>
<p>The visuals are nicely paired with an impressive 180Hz refresh rate that eliminates lag for smoother action. A 1ms response time also reduces motion blur, helping you jump into action without waiting.</p>



<p>The gaming monitor is G-Sync compatible, which means it is designed to work well with NVIDIA GPUs by matching its refresh rate to the frame output of the GPU. Even better, it supports AMD FreeSync to keep complex scenes stable. What does this mean for you? Low input lag and smoother gameplay that gives you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Those planning to game for long hours will appreciate the Eye Saver Mode, which minimizes blue light to keep your eyes comfortable throughout your sessions. As for the build, the monitor flaunts an ergonomic stand that comfortably swivels, tilts, and adjusts to help you find the right viewing position. You can even rotate it vertically when you need to read or take quick video calls!</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your current monitor to enjoy better visuals and smoother gameplay, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">This 32-inch Samsung gaming monitor offers all that and more, and the current 42% discount makes the display far more affordable.</a> If the 32-inch size feels like too much, there’s a 27-inch version of the same model available for $230, down from $350.</p>

But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world won’t determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, in Crimson Desert you can fly around on a dragon, so despite the size of its world, you’ll be able to get about quickly. And don’t expect RPG elements in terms of decision-making and choice and consequence as it relates to your character, either. The sheer amount of things to do in the world will facilitate the role-playing part of Crimson Desert, which players will form through “head canon.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert IGN First - Combat and Mounts Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You choose the type of character you want to play as in terms of your progression within the systems in the game,” Powers explained. “And then through head canon you’re having this very different experience than other players because of the scope and scale of the game. You’ll be distracted by something, you’ll go on this quest line, you’ll have an experience that’ll be radically different than someone else, even though they’re playing the same game and the same canonical storyline that you both are going through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the part of Crimson Desert shown off to the media in previews is just "a tiny corner of the map," Powers added. Crimson Desert is due out March 19, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>1401643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are saying farewell to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, BioWare's failed live-service blockbuster, as its servers are switched off and the game disappears forever — officially, at least. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem publisher EA announced last year that the jetpack-fuelled shooter had just months to live, and cautioned that the server shutdown would render the game completely unplayable, with its world, characters and lore no longer available once the plug was pulled. Now, as this day has neared, new and returning players have loaded up the game for one last flight, and to push for the game's platinum trophy while they still can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, meanwhile, have begun a small push to keep Anthem alive via custom private servers — though the effort has been hampered somewhat by the game's lack of reach.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I missed the server closure announcement last year, and just learned about it a couple days ago," wrote one belated fan, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7zzeq/just_started_playing_yesterday_and_im_having_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberpwnPiper</a>. "I had never played it so I decided to take the game for a spin before it's too late, and the game is quite good. I'm just playing casually and I'm still a noob after about 4 hours in, but there's a solid foundation here. There are good bones. The visuals are fantastic, the combat and action are fun, and the javelin flight is phenomenal (and unique)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon release, after a lengthy and troubled development, BioWare received praise for Anthem's Javelin mechsuit combat and particularly its flight mechanic, which let you zoom around the game's open world like Iron Man alongside a team of friends. But players and critics alike were less sold on Anthem's threadbare attempt at storytelling, especially when compared to the studio's beloved Dragon Age and Mass Effect games. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Anthem never convinced players of BioWare's decision to pivot towards an online-only live-service, in an apparent attempt to recapture the crowd that had flocked to Bungie's Destiny. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, players are continuing to find reasons to enjoy a dip into Anthem's world, even if it is just to satisfy their curiosity before the game goes for good. "I truly wish I played it when it was released," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7hm6q/i_wish_i_played_it_sooner/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRB1993</a>. "I knew the end was coming and I wanted to get the chance to say, 'I was there'. I can honestly say that it scratched that same itch that Destiny does. The gunplay, the different Javelins (Colossus FTW!), the differing choice of abilities, the flying, the story (still can't believe Owen did what he did!), the differing style of enemies, there's too much to list!" Added CyberpwnPiper: "I wish I had started playing sooner to at least finish most of the story quests and experience different Javelin suits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some returning players have meanwhile set themselves the challenge of unlocking Anthem's full list of achievements/trophies, which will become unobtainable forever when the game's servers go offline. It has been a race against time — though many have completed the feat over the past week as EA's clock runs down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a bittersweet feeling getting this platinum," <u>said</u> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7dsk7/its_a_bittersweet_feeling_getting_this_platinum/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbsolutelyNotAClone</a>. "I didn't think I'd push away all other games and throw another work week's worth of hours into it. But damn, I missed this game, and will miss it even more. I feel ashamed, I feel sad, but I feel so much better that I pushed for this platinum." Fellow fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7ocvf/in_the_last_4_days_wanted_to_finish_it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rymus</a>, meanwhile, said they'd just hit Anthem's full Gamerscore on Xbox. "From the VIP weekend to the end this game will always be one of my faves despite the flaws," they wrote. "Learning the game was shutting down I wanted to give it the honor it deserved. My ranger with the VIP decal [has] been my main from the beginning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wasn’t sure if I’d make it," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q74jmo/platinum_achieved/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeby4</a>, who also unlocked Anthem's platinum trophy. "Sooo many collectibles. I was getting burned out there following a YouTube guide but I locked in over the last four days and got it done! I didn’t have nearly as many hours as I know a lot of others did, but man, I’m gonna miss this game so much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I finally got it done on time!" wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q4qsi6/praying_anthem_not_to_get_shutdown/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KingExile96</a>. "I wish they wouldn't shut down. I wish they would just sell or give the game to another company, I want it to get another chance! It's got its potential. It was stressful getting the trophies but it was so fun at the same, roaming around, fighting bosses doing elements combo, man... I'm gonna miss this game so much. Anthem will be in my heart 🫶🤘"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there's little chance Anthem will ever be officially revived or handed off to another developer, some fans still hope the game will become playable once again via custom PC servers. Several Discord groups have been set up to explore the possibility of making Anthem playable in future, the largest of which is The Fort's Forge — a community that has been asking players to capture records of the game's communications with EA servers, so these can then be backwards engineered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This process has been slow, with just a handful of players helping out last year, but progress has now reached a point where a good amount of data has been obtained. Still, there's no suggestion the game will be revived at any point in the near future, and it remains to be seen whether EA itself steps in to block the project's progress. IGN has contacted the team behind the effort for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while a handful of fans work on one potential future for the game, many others are now simply taking the chance to say goodbye. Dozens have recorded screenshots of their characters via one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q41wbm/can_we_have_a_thread_where_we_all_share_our/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a> thread for posterity, while others are simply reminiscing and sharing their thanks to BioWare and to their fellow players who served as the game's Freelancers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I enjoyed it till the end and I have a lot of good memories," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q5j2ee/one_last_flight_around_bastion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RobRagiel</a>, who posted a video of their final flight around Anthem's world. "It was an honor, Freelancers. For the Legion of Dawn!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had played the game since launch and I loved it," concluded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q62at6/my_fashion_to_the_grave/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remarkable-Set-3340</a>. "I wish this game had more time. See ya’ll in the sky’s till the sun sets one last time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you like the future Western aesthetic then Paradark Studios’ ExeKiller is one to keep an eye on. Described as a retro future Western, ExeKiller is set in a dystopian future where a catastrophic event has turned Earth into a scorched desert planet. But an apocalyptic event won’t get in the way of the darker side of human nature, meaning a bounty hunter is needed to find some criminals.</p>
<p><iframe title="ExeKiller - Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEeUzd4nAmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new gameplay overview, Paradark Studios shows different aspects of the world which you inhabit as Denzel Fenix, aka the bounty hunter known as ExeKiller. He works for the Helion company and as the story progresses revelations about the world and himself make Denzel a target for different factions. That means players have to be on the lookout for danger everywhere.</p>
<p>ExeKiller is set in a semi open world with one of the central locations being The Tower. Here Denzel can upgrade and purchase gear, gather information, and pick up some bounties to hunt. It is a generally safe area, a stark difference to the world outside. Denzel travels across the world in a car that has been designed to withstand things like severe weather and radiation, but you cannot avoid such dangers all of the time. Out of the car, Denzel has to be aware of both enemies and the environment which could turn to make things difficult. Players have full autonomy on how missions are resolved with no set linear paths. You can choose to go in all guns blazing, sneak around, talk your way through situations, or a mixture of all of these approaches. Whatever approach is chosen will impact how NPCs and factions react to Denzel, and the game’s ending. There is no XP to earn in the game with Denzel’s skills reliant on player skill and the mods and augments that are installed in Denzel.</p>

<p>A release date for ExeKiller has yet to be confirmed and so far it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

			<p>When <strong>Larian Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced <strong>Divinity</strong></a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it likely did not think what would follow would be swarms of backlash targeted at the studio and its chief executive officer, <strong>Swen Vincke</strong>. Not because it had announced a new Divinity game, but because Vincke had made it clear that Larian had <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">been experimenting with using GenAI tools in its development process</a>.</p>



<p>Those comments came with considerable backlash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">to which Vincke responded fairly bluntly</a> before trying a more measured statement, but that did not stop players and other game developers in the industry who are entirely against the use of GenAI tools from hurling more vitriol towards Larian Studios. Game writers and some former Larian developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">even took the opportunity to pile on Larian more with the airing of grievances</a> around the studio's poor hiring practices and how it introduced GenAI in the first place.</p>



<p>Other members of the industry, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian</a>, but it seemed that Larian's critics would not be satisfied with anything short of Vincke entirely denouncing the use of GenAI tools and admitting he and the team were wrong to even try using them. To cap off his comments on the topic in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Vincke said "<em>a lot has been lost in translation</em>"</a> on the topic, and promised that he and the team would do a Reddit AMA to let players ask whatever questions they want to provide a clear and final word on the topic.</p>



<p>Well, that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA has been happening today</a>, and it should be no surprise that t<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">he first question was all about GenAI tools</a> and their role in Divinity's development, and within Larian Studios overall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Vincke was the one to answer it, and while he did not provide the answer that would satisfy the biggest GenAI critics, he did clear up one element of the studio's generative AI use.</p>



<p>"<em>So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity</em>," Vincke began. "<em>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</em> <em>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</em>"</p>



<p>But Vincke didn't stop there. While the studio will "<em>refrain from using genAI</em>" for concept art, other areas are still on the table, as a means of trying to speed up development where possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</em> <em>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own</em>."</p>



<p>In a follow-up question, Larian Studios' writing director <strong>Adam Smith</strong> confirmed that the approach to GenAI tools in concept art applies to writing as well, even when it comes to just using generative text as a placeholder. "<em>The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity</em>," Smith wrote.</p>



<p>"<em>To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'"- it doesn't. We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts - and there are a LOT of them - are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous. From the initial stub to the line we record and ship, there are a great many eyes and hands involved in getting a dialogue right.</em>"</p>



<p>So it's not the answer that the studio's biggest critics would like, but it's clear that the needle has moved on Larian Studios' use of GenAI. For now, the use of generative AI tools in game development will continue to be a controversial topic, whichever side of the aisle you're on.</p>

            <p>This is proving to be one of the worst weeks of my life, for various reasons (no, not because Jason Schreier is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-not-yet-be-content-complete-and-another-release-delay-is-possible-claims-jason-schreier">mad at me</a>). In my time of need, I open the magic portal of escapism and find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> looking back at me like a poison toad.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hello, Pathologic 3! You are that game about saving a town of butchers from the grandfather of all plagues. You are the Stoppardian fantasy about interrogating the bodies and souls of tricksters, oligarchs and killers. You are the inner wobble between mania and apathy. You are the doomed mayoral enterprise in which players impose quarantines and roadblocks, while trying to maintain the trust of some powerful factions. You are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">out now-ish on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve got a time-rewinding feature these days, so that players can reverse their foolish decisions without starting afresh? You're giving players the ability to clear away miasma using some kind of refillable doohickey? Generous of you, Pathologic 3, but I can see the rusty meat cleaver in your other hand.</p>
<p>RPS has an ancient, fraught relationship with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> series. We are beloved among the elder Pathologgers for Quintin Smith’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body">three-part essay on the original 2005 game</a>, and we are also... disliked, to put it gently, for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">somewhat ambivalent about Pathologic 2</a> – the sequel-turned-remake dedicated to just one of the original game’s three playable protagonists. I’m likely going to be reviewing Pathologic 3, and I’m already dreading the fallout if I conclude that I am Not Keen. Still, duty calls. Something's calling, anyway. I hear it in the basement. It sounds like it has a voicebox made entirely of teeth.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> concerned the doings of the Haruspex, a returning local son who fights the plague using a mixture of surgery and steppe lore, Pathologic 3 focuses on the Bachelor, an academic doctor who is pursuing a rumoured immortal man. While it has similar rancid geography, and the same atmosphere of phantasmagorical confusion and despair, it’s a very different and perhaps an easier game in many respects, as Brendy found when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">playing the demo last year</a>. </p>
<p>The often-exhausting open world format is gone. You don’t have to worry as much about the bare necessities of survival, either, and the time-jumping feature allows for some trial and error, though this isn’t exactly routine savescumming – as Brendy summarised, “you earn time travel gunge by playing a euthanasia minigame where you ease the passing of dying people in the street by administering morphine or other drugs”. A Tardis powered by human souls? How very pathological of you, Pathologic 3.</p>
<p>Developers Ice-Pick Lodge appear to be in a difficult place at the moment. Last year, founder Nikolay Dybowski left the studio after players <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">discovered allegations of abuse and kidnapping</a>. The remaining staff have yet to really comment on these reports. It’s not clear they ever will. I can imagine the painful legalities that may be involved.</p>
<p>Ice Pick are Russian-founded, and you may wish to avoid their games if you’re concerned about indirectly funding Russia’s vicious, zealous and cynical attack on Ukraine. They are currently based in Kazakhstan, however, who appear cautiously supportive of Ukraine’s independence and are calling for peace (I am no expert on the geopolitics here). The developers have also spoken out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commenting back in 2022 that "a crime is being committed in our name”. </p><p>If Pathologic 3 is a success, Ice-Pick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">will hopefully make Pathologic 4</a>. This will star the Changeling, a young girl who can restore life or take it away through touch. Pathologic aside, Ice Pick are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pathologic-devs-are-making-darkwood-2-with-acid-wizards-blessing-in-a-frankly-outrageous-piece-of-horror-synergy">partnering with Hooded Horse and Acid Wizard to make Darkwood 2</a>.  </p>
