			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test will be held next week on all platforms, complete with cross-platform play support.</p>
<p>During today's&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/KxYKTXuoxXQ?si=WBxlxRBCByYHy_0b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Showcase</a>, it was confirmed that players on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S will be able to try out the game from October 31st at 8:00 pm until November 3rd at 6:59 pm PT. PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to access the open beta a few days earlier, from October 28th at 8:00 pm to October 30th at 7:59 pm PT. The beta test will include Character Creation to create characters that can be transferred into the final version of the game, a Story Trial, which will grant players to play through the game's first few sequences, and a Doshaguma hunt where players will have to take out an Alpha Doshaguma and also be able to try out multiplayer.</p>
<p>During today's Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase, a new trailer was also shared, showcasing the Oilwell Basin location and the Rompopolo and Ajarakan monsters. You can check out the trailer and the entirety of today's showcase below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase | 2024.10.23" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxYKTXuoxXQ?start=549&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Judging from the description of the included content, the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta will feature the same content featured in the Gamescom beta. If so, hunters will be in for a threat, as it was a great showcase of some of the game's new features and mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th, 2025.</p>

The Cursed expedition event runs for the next two weeks and features new bosses, new gear, a flying saucer, and a UFO players can make their own.</p><p>As with every new <em>NMS</em> event, the developers at Hello Games are changing up how the game works. The Cursed takes place in a new universe where the line between life and... unlife?? is perilously thin. The exosuit, which normally protects players from the harsh environs of space and alien planets, now comes with an “anomaly suppressor” that’ll keep them stable as reality shifts around them. Additionally, players won’t be able to warp between star systems, having to instead travel via a portal system (kinda like how guild navigators ferry everyone about in <em>Dune</em> — minus the all psychoactive drug use). </p><p>Speaking of celebrated figures in sci-fi, The Cursed also includes a new hub deemed the Boundary StarShip which according to the blog post takes its artistic inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger. Expect plenty of tubes, fleshy ridges, and <em>wet </em>stuff. The Cursed expedition starts today and lasts for the next two weeks. But if spooky stuff isn’t your jam, Hello Games is also planing something special that’s focused on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">pending launch of the PS5 Pro.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developers Dreamlit have piped over fresh footage of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> ecotribal extravaganza <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/towers-of-aghasba">Towers Of Aghasba</a>. It's an abbreviated but generous display of equatorial exotica and vaguely prehistoric wildlife, home to such key verbs as "exploration", "village-building", "gardening", "creature-nurturing" and "murdering megasloths with a lump of wood". And look at that, there's a release date perched on top - 19th November 2024.

Kaan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/towers-of-aghasba-has-all-the-settlement-building-and-flying-whales-you-could-hope-for">liked this one</a> when he saw it at last May's PlayStation showcase. I am quite interested myself, but being an older and more jaded soul, I also suspect a certain hollowness. The premise here is that you're a junior architect of the Shimu tribe, on a mission to restore a landscape racked by the forces of the Withered. To do this, you will mingle with local gods, rebuild villages and plant enormous trees that greenify the surrounding earth and attract various fantasy animals. 
</p>
<p>
These you can kill for their craftable wibbly bits, or nurture for more lasting benefits and because you don't want to slaughter the nice floofy pastel dragon that's just ambled into your jungle. If you find such eco-positivity irksome, or you outright despise pastel colours and floof, you can always run off to areas where the Withered still hold sway.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Withered look like giant undead tree people. Their dominions are wrapped in swirling layers of monochrome fog - I'm reminded of Ghost Of Tsushima's Kurosawa Mode. Combat is real-time and seems to be a familiar mix of combos, archery and dodge-rolling. There's a crafting system for weapons, armour and elixirs, but it doesn't appear to be the focus. If you need reinforcements, there's co-op support. Also, you get a hang-glider like the one in Zelda. Don't tell Link. I'm sure he has plenty of spares.
</p>
<p>
Things I like: the sheer abundance of vegetation and critters in flourishing areas, and the accompanying emphasis on understanding the animals and their habits, which makes me think of Subnautica. I am looking forward to lurking under some fronds and rubbing my thighs while the floofy pastel dragon sniffs dubiously at the berries I've just left out for it. I wonder if the game's ecosystem simulation stretches to cases of food poisoning?</p>
<p>I also like the organicity and tuber-like appearance of the buildings, though the game's heady Tribal Themes do feel like they've been cartoonishly lifted from indigenous cultures without sufficient reflection.</p>
<p>It's a shame they've gone with a building system based on holographic templates - I understand that this is more user-friendly and no, I have no idea how I'd construct a wattle and daub house without holographic templates, but the downside of a world of organic shapes is that any outright computery elements really <em>clang</em>. "Your creativity will be both challenged and rewarded," gushes the trailer narrator, as the on-screen character waves a hammer and conjures an entire ornamental flowerbed into existence.
</p><p>
You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178070/Towers_of_Aghasba/">the Steam page</a>. I'm keen to give it a play, but I do wonder if Towers Of Aghasba will ultimately prove to be just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game with some superficial eco-theming. I want to see at least five minutes of uninterrupted play before I join Kaan aboard the giddy hang-glider of anticipation.

The (pricey) skateboards are some of the nicest pieces of high-quality merchandise you can find under the <em>Pokémon </em>umbrella. Despite their steep cost, they must be selling well because The Pokémon Company keeps making them. A new line of boards dedicated to some of the powerful “pseudo legendary” Pokémon has just been released, and if you want them, you might want to jump on them pretty quick, as one of them has already sold out.<br></p><p>The four new boards cost $299.99 on the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon Center</a></span> website, and feature gorgeous art of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12815/pokemon-center-bear-walker-garchomp-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12815/pokemon-center-bear-walker-garchomp-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garchomp</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12816/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragonite-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12816/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragonite-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonite</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12814/pokemon-center-bear-walker-tyranitar-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12814/pokemon-center-bear-walker-tyranitar-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyranitar</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12813/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragapult-skateboard&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/720E12813/pokemon-center-bear-walker-dragapult-skateboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragapult</a></span>. They’re slightly more expensive than the average <em>Pokémon </em>X Bear Walker board, likely because the Pokémon art is in full color compared to the more minimalist coloring of previous boards. I have the Pikachu one on my wall right now and can attest to their quality. So if you’re a Garchomp, Tyranitar, or Dragapult fan, I recommend these boards. If you’re a Dragonite fan, however, you’ll have to find it elsewhere, as it appears to have sold out already.</p><p>Annoyingly enough, the Dragonite boards are showing up on sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dragonite+bear+walker&amp;_sacat=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dragonite+bear+walker&amp;_sacat=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a></span> with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">scalpers asking for more than twice the original price</a></span>.

<p>Today is a day that Monster Hunter Wilds fans have been eagerly anticipating!</p>



<p>During the recent showcase dedicated to the game, Capcom unveiled an exciting open beta that will be available to everyone. This beta test is divided into three main segments: the classic character creation system, a brief introduction to the story, and a thrilling hunt for the alpha Doshaguma.</p>



<p>Check out the dates of the open beta below:</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-take-place">When will the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta take place?</h2>



<p>One of the surprises of the announcement is that PlayStation Plus subscribers will have early access to the trial. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus subscribers:</p>

<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-content-of-the-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">What’s the content of the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta?</h2>



<p>TThe beta consists of three exciting parts. First up is the character creation segment, where users will have full access to all features available in the final game. Plus, your character’s data can be carried over to the full release, allowing you to hit the ground running!</p>



<p>Next, there’s the Story Trial. In this segment, players can watch the opening cutscene and participate in their first hunt against the Chatacabra, all while receiving helpful tutorials.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The final part is sure to thrill veteran players. In the Doshaguma Hunt, you’ll set out to track and take down the alpha of the Doshaguma pack, which introduces a <a href="https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Doshaguma">brand-new monster</a> to the series.</p>



<p>Players will also have the ability to use the SOS Flare to team up and explore online with fellow gamers. If the matchmaking doesn’t find anyone, you’ll be paired with three bots for assistance. This feature is designed to make the game more accessible for newcomers. Plus, crossplay will be active during the test!</p>



<p>As a special bonus, participants in the open beta will receive a unique pendant to customize their weapons or seikret.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/disc-editions-make-up-82-of-all-ps5-console-sales/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Disc editions of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) make up a majority of its console sales in the United States. </p>



<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mhopwoy27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, 82% of the lifetime sales of the PS5 are those with a disc drive. That puts digital-only consoles at just 18% of the total sales.</p>







<p>Sony has made a push in recent years for players to move to the digital-only version of its system. Not only does the company charge less for the digital-only PS5, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PS5 Pro</a> only comes in a digital version. In order to play discs, you’ll have to buy a disc drive separately, adding more to your cost.</p>



<p>That said, it appears that, so far at least, players are ok with spending a little extra for the option to play physical media on their console. And while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital-only future seems likely</a> for games, it doesn’t look like gamers are ready to fully go that route yet,</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-fc-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-september-2024/">EA Sports FC 25 Was The Best-Selling Game In US For September 2024</a></h6>



<p>For what it’s worth, September 2024 saw digital PS5 sales make up 40% of new sales for the month. </p>



<p>On the Xbox side of things, the Xbox Series X just surpassed the Xbox Series S in terms of total unit sales. As of September 2024, the Series X has a slim 51% majority over the cheaper Series S in the US.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PS5 sales being mostly consoles with disc drives? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

It ditches Fallout’s traditional United States setting for a post-apocalyptic London packed with famous British landmarks and references. It even secured the likes of Baldur's Gate 3's Neil Newbon for its voice cast, with former UK Speaker of the House John Bercow in the game, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-review-mod">Fallout: London review</a> returned a 7/10.

"That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: London eventually launched in July in partnership with GOG, which made the announcement today, October 23 - aka Fallout Day (October 23 is the day the bombs first fell in fallout lore).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today, we couldn’t be happier to see the success that Fallout: London has become – reaching the entirety of one million owners on our platform, and achieving it on Fallout Day no less,” GOG said. “We’d like to take this moment to wholeheartedly congratulate Team FOLON on their groundbreaking record!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement posted on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1298631956438712330" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: London Discord</a>, the mod team added: “You’ve made this journey unforgettable.

Bethesda continues to update Fallout 76, and plans for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> at some point in the future, perhaps when it’s done with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In June, Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success">he wasn’t interested in rushing a new Fallout game out the door</a>, just because Fallout is hot right now.

The core game development team, based at Ubisoft Montpellier, allegedly pushed for a sequel or at least more expansions beyond the single Mask of Darkness expansion, but Ubisoft needed help on other projects that had better sales potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a>, most of the people behind the one million-selling Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have moved on to the eternally in-development Beyond Good and Evil 2, but others have been sent to help out on the next mainline Ghost Recon and about a dozen are now working on an unannounced Rayman remake in development at Mario + Rabbids maker Ubisoft Milan. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rayman, created by video game designer Michel Ancel and first released in 1995, hasn't seen a mainline release since 2013's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a>. Ancel is reportedly working on the remake as a consultant, which, Insider Gaming reports, has ruffled feathers inside Ubisoft. Ancel was the subject of an internal investigation in 2020 after he was accused of behavior that led to difficult working conditions for the staff on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Ancel subsequently refuted the allegations and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-says-hes-quit-video-games-to-open-a-wildlife-sanctuary">announced plans to quit the world of video games to open a wildlife sanctuary</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/gettyimages-1227128375-1729688028482.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Michel Ancel promoting Rayman in 2011.

This terrain is known to erupt into raging flames during a period of Inclemency known as the Firespring. The newly revealed Brute Wyvern Rompopolo prowls within areas blanketed in a deep oil silt. This fearsome predator expels a toxic gas from its tongue to weaken its prey before using its tail to inject gas into the tar blanketing the ground causing bubbling eruptions. Rompopolo often finds itself battling for territory against roaming Ajarakan, another previously unseen monster that calls this region home. This red-hot Fanged Beast rubs its thick shell to cover itself in a sweltering armor. Amidst this incredibly harsh, ever-changing environment, the skilled craftsman village of Azuz grew around a massive central forge. While the local artisans and fearsome wildlife struggle to survive, a mysterious monster known to locals as the “Black Flame” lurks deep beneath the basin.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_923205"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Vendetta Forever is a VR shooter that immediately draws comparisons that land it somewhere between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/07/19/superhot-vr-review/">Superhot VR</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/rhythm-action-game-pistol-whip-will-be-released-on-psvr-this-summer/">Pistol Whip</a>. It’s got the fast shooting and score hunting of the latter mixed with intense, almost bullet hell slo-mo of the former. But there is, of course, much more to it than that oversimplified description.</p>
<p><iframe title="VENDETTA FOREVER Countdown Trailer | nDreams | Meta Quest &amp; PS VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcPuxt1ilMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shoot to kill, and kill to move. That’s the real ethos running through Vendetta Forever. You don’t move freely around the environments in Vendetta Forever, but instead have to action movie you way through. Shoot someone and you can grab their gun, quickly moving you to their position to shoot whomever is next. You’ll feel like John Wick as you make your way down a train carriage, grabbing guns and knives out of the air to keep moving, staying of the way of incoming fire as you go, spinning around and shooting at surrounding enemies. It’s the closest to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02E2sjwlLM">Gun Kata</a> you can get in a game.</p>


<p>Meatspace Interactive have taken that core concept and had as much fun as possible with it. In one level you’re falling down the centre of a spiral staircase, spinning in the air as you shoot enemies that are on the stairs. In another, there’s a duel – as in, turn on three and shoot – whilst another is basically the lobby scene from The Matrix. There are western themed levels with cowboys shooting at you from balconies as you blast your way through a town, or a race against a fuse as you try to put it out and save some hostages. There’s something for every persuasion here, provided it involves shooting people in increasingly stylish ways. It’s great.</p>


<p>You aren’t limited to just pistols and throwing knives. There’s uzis, miniguns, sniper rifles, even a rocket launcher showing up depending the level. Then there’s a katana which is perhaps the only way to move without grabbing a gun, as it lets you dash at enemies and slice them up. Not to mention the daft way that you have to either pluck throwing knives and shurikens out of the air as enemies throw them at you, but if you don’t quite manage to catch or dodge them, you can always pluck them out of your face and throw them back in a display of vengeance that is truly incredible both in its absurdity and sheer satisfaction.</p>
<p>This isn’t an easy game and there are quite a few things to think about while playing. There’s enemies literally all around you, making both quick real life movement as well as snap-to-turn with the analogue stick essential – I typically use smooth turning in VR, but snapping is just so much quicker. You’ll also need to play standing up and the game requires roomscale for your play area.</p>

<p>Within the game, you’ll want to be quick about grabbing guns when you shoot baddies, as they despawn sometimes when left alone – though curiously not all the time, so I’m not certain how intentional this is – and if there’s no gun to grab you simply can’t move. It’s kind of a puzzle shooter in the same way Superhot was, but here you need to pick a route and order in which to shoot enemies, then use that route quickly or lose it. It’s made much harder by all the bullet dodging and shooting you’re actually doing, of course.</p>
<p>I’m in two minds about the movement system, as when you’re moving through a level smoothly it’s very satisfying, but having nowhere left to go ruins the flow state the game tries to get you into. It’s not the end of the world, especially as you can cycle back through positions you’ve already been in on an attempt and, if you’re lucky, you’ll spot a gun or an enemy you’ve missed.</p>
<p>The game’s visuals are kept nice and simple – not quite as minimalist as Superhot and Pistol Whip, but still with a toned down aesthetic. That’s for the best considering how quickly you’ll need to recognise enemies in order to shoot them before they do the same to you. It has it charm though, with the stripped down aesthetic still more than capable of communicating when you’re in a western or The Matrix, whilst still ensuring you can spot everything you need to easily enough.</p>

<p>I have to mention my favourite levels, both of which are what I have decided to called “Daredevil levels.” In these, it’s pitch black except for when there’s sound. You begin in darkness and can see the footsteps of an enemy nearby as a circle radiating outwards from its source, but when you shoot enemies know where you are. Of course, you can grab an enemy’s weapon, zip to their position and all the living enemies will lose track of you until you make some noise, but because they just fired at your last position, you can see their locations for a few seconds. Stand still for a moment and everything goes pitch black again, but you can throw a gun to make a noise as it clatters against a wall so enemies fire at it, giving their positions away. This is one of the most unique shooter and VR experiences I’ve had and it is thrilling. It’s phenomenally cool and I would play a full game of it without hesitation.</p>
<p>On top of all this there is a selection of mutators to modify the game, whether you want it to be more forgiving by enabling what’s effectively an invincible mode to take the pressure off and enjoy the over the top nature of the game, or whether you want to turn off aim assist, which makes the game unbelievably difficult to handle, naturally. If you’re a real glutton for punishment, there are higher difficulty levels for you test your skills on as well.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished the levels – and there’s quite a few, even if each one is quite short once you’ve perfected your run – you can always go back and compete on the online leaderboards to extract some more longevity. Just in case you get tired of just playing the lobby scene from The Matrix in VR over and over and over…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-cursed-expedition-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Expedition, and if you felt like last month's update was a little too sedate for your tastes, then this one is definitely for you.</p>
<p>Back in September, Hello Games launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update">the Aquarius update</a>, which introduced a chilled-out fishing mechanic to the sandbox space sim. Now, though, the studio says its latest update "couldn't be more different" to Aquarius, and that The Cursed is "embracing the spookier side of the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>
<p>For the titular The Cursed Expedition, you'll be journeying to a mysterious twilight realm in which you won't be able to access your hyperdrive, meaning you'll have to rely on an "ancient portal network" in order to get around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-the-cursed-expedition-portal-network.jpg?itok=4H-QmJ-T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-the-cursed-expedition-portal-network.jpg?itok=P7mwYWBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Expedition will take away your hyperdrive capabilities.</figcaption></figure><p>While you'd normally be battling against the likes of temperature, atmospheric toxicity, and other hazards in&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, the new The Cursed Expedition will instead have you grappling with "the weakening of the boundaries of reality".</p>
<p>Your suit will be equipped with an Anomaly Suppressor, which you'll have to maintain if you want to make it through the Expedition unharmed. As your Suppressor weakens, Anomalies will start to gather and become hostile, and "time will begin to behave in non-linear ways".</p>
<p>In order to get through the Expedition, you'll have access to a variety of new Elixirs to help you sustain boundary strength and discover portals, and if you do manage to make it through, a variety of rewards await you.</p>
<p>These rewards include new decorative posters, new customization options, and even a brand new starship, as well as an adorable (well, I think it's adorable) "gelatinous and luminescent" companion creature.</p>

<p>There's lots of other stuff to look forward to in this new Expedition. You can check out the full patch notes for The Cursed <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/10/expedition-sixteen-the-cursed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>Video game hardware sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-drastically-in-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to fall</a> in the United States, and not by just a little. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mgp4syn2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Circana</a> released the latest US data on Wednesday, and it shows yet another month of falling sales numbers.</p>



<p>Hardware spending fell from $445 million to $251 million, or 44%, year-over-year. The fall represents the lowest amount spent on hardware sales in September since 2019 where revenue was $242 million.</p>







<p>The drop in sales was felt across the board as sales of the Xbox Series systems fell 54% year-over-year followed by a 45% drop in PlayStation 5 sales. The Nintendo Switch, which is set to be replaced within the next year, saw a 23% year-over-year decline. </p>



<p>In total, year-to-date hardware sales are down 30% compared to last year. It’s worth mentioning, however, that sales have still brought in $2.5 billion in 2024.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, there was actually a 1% increase from September 2023. Accessory sales rose to $217 million for the month thanks to the sales of the PlayStation Portal, which remains the best-selling accessory in dollar sales for the year. It’s owned by 3% of PlayStation 5 owners.</p>



<p>What do you think of the video game hardware sales continuing to fall in the US? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>The United States video game sales data for September 2024 has been released, and there’s a new name at the top of the list of the best-selling games for the month. According to new data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mf4ygfc2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, EA Sports FC 25 was the best-selling game in the US for September. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 5-exclusive Astro Bot finished second. </p>



<p>It’s the third-straight month an EA Sports title was the best-selling game after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 25 topped August’s sales</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Football 25 led the way</a> in July.</p>



<p>As far as other new games on the list, seven games made their debut in the top 20. Those games include Astro Bot, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, NBA 2K25, NHL 25, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>Four other games returned to the top 20 after being off the list, including Dead Rising, Final Fantasy 16, God of War: Ragnarök, and Age of Mythology. There were 11 games from August that fell off. Helldivers 2, Mario Kart 8, MLB: The Show 24, and Gran Turismo 7 are just a few of the games that find themselves outside the top 20 for the month.</p>

Instead, interstellar travel can only take place via the ancient portal network.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Haunting voices, leaking through from another dimension, will provide guidance, information, strange blueprints… and mystery. It is up to you to decide who these voices belong to, where they are coming from, and if they are to be trusted.</p><p>In regular <em>No Man’s Sky</em> play, Travellers must steel themselves against a variety of environmental hazards such as extreme temperatures, radioactivity, and toxic atmospheres. The Cursed, however, pits you against a single, more insidious threat: the weakening of the boundaries of reality. Your exosuit comes fitted with a specialised Anomaly Suppressor; maintain it to stay firmly in this reality.</p><p>Spectral anomalies—ghostly creatures drifting across the boundaries—will gather to watch Travellers moving through their domain. Most of the time, they are simply there to observe, but be warned: as your suit’s Anomaly Suppressor weakens, time will begin to behave in non-linear ways, and these anomalies may turn hostile.</p><p>Travellers will need to prepare a number of otherworldly concoctions to navigate through The Cursed. Sustain boundary strength with the Elixir of Glass, reveal the location of portals with the Elixir of Quicksilver, and prise open the gateways with the Elixir of Blood. For those that reach the end of the journey, its final trial will require a drink from the Elixir of Water—and the consequences thereafter.</p><p>The Cursed expedition begins today, and will run for approximately two weeks. Travel beyond the boundaries, and fortify your mind against spectral anomalies—or succumb to the call of the world of glass.</p><p><strong>■ The Cursed Expedition Rewards</strong></p><p><strong><a title="Games > Boundary [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/boundary">Boundary</a> Anomaly, Portal Breach and Glyph Posters</strong></p><p>Remember your journey across the boundaries with these decorative posters: warnings to all those who would venture into the tunnels of the portal network.</p><p><strong>Anomaly Seal Base Part</strong></p><p>During The Cursed, the spectral energy radiating from this ancient artifact protects nearby entities against catastrophic reality breaches.</p><p>In a more stable universe, the Anomaly Seal serves as a decorative souvenir from beyond the boundaries.</p><p><strong>Ink-Stained Jetpack Trail</strong></p><p>An exclusive jetpack customisation. A localised anomaly within the jetpack’s core allows the spectral afterglow of the boundary horrors to leak across into this reality.</p><p><strong>Boundary <a title="Genres > Horror [516 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a> Mandibles</strong></p><p>An exclusive Exosuit Appearance Override. Transform your facade into that of a Boundary Horror, a fragment of what dwells beyond the tunnels of the portal network…</p><p><strong>Bioluminescent Companion</strong></p><p>The egg of a gelatinous and luminescent lifeform. This unusual companion creature is lit by a haunting pale glow.</p><p><strong>Boundary Herald Starship</strong></p><p>Retrieve this exclusive starship from the reality collapse, and slice through the skies in UFO-like style.</p><p><strong>Community Research</strong></p><p>The Quicksilver Synthesis Companion’s latest research endeavour is a set of Blue, Purple and Teal fireworks, which burst into a cluster of bursts into a cluster of wildly spiralling ribbons upon launch. Every mission completed at the Nexus contributes towards the research progress for these exotic items.</p><p><strong>■ Development Update</strong></p><p>The Cursed expedition is our sixth named update for 2024, following Omega, Orbital, Adrift, Worlds Part I, and Aquarius.

Ubisoft has decided to move a majority of the team who worked on the metroidvania title to "other projects" at the company.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/" data-ref-id="1900-6418167">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> senior producer Abdelhak Elguess issued a statement to GameSpot confirming that the game's team is no longer together. "Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise," Elguess said. "We know players have a love for this brand, and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1980850043" data-promo-id="0"

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> team has released an appropriately-timed spooky update for its life-simulation game, which focuses on the afterlife, and allows us to once again get down and dirty with the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>This base game update is available across platforms, and also lets you create ghost characters (from child upwards) in the Create A Sim menu. Here, you can choose how your Sim died, with different deaths giving "unique abilities" to ghosts.</p>
<p>These spectral Sims will have a new set of needs, different to those of live Sims. These needs include: Goo Waste, Ethereal Sustenance, Otherworldly Slumber, Spooky Diversions, Ethereal Bonding, and Apparition Cleansing. If a Sim should die during gameplay, you will have the option to keep the Sim as a playable character, or make them a "freeroaming" ghost instead.</p>

<p>Sticking with the death theme, Sims now also have unique reactions to another Sim's passing. This includes plenty of tears if the deceased Sim was someone near and dear, or just straight up retching if the relationship isn't strong.</p>
<p>And, if a Sim does pass and the game's ever reliable Grim Reaper shows up, you can now WooHoo with the soul collector again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following reports yesterday, Ubisoft has confirmed that the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has been disbanded, with its employees at Ubisoft Montpellier being moved along to other projects. This will be hugely disappointing news to fans of the Metroidvania twist on Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>The news came yesterday from French reporter Gautoz in their show on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami YouTube channel</a>, with Ubisoft reportedly making the decision to allow for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-mask-of-darkness-is-a-near-essential-dlc/">DLC</a> and cosmetics roadmap to be released for the game, but end support there and not greenlight a sequel or any further expansions. The decision went so far as to say this was so as not to “cannibalize” long term sales of the game.</p>


<p>While the specifics of the reporting haven’t been confirmed by Ubisoft, the general gist has been. Abdelhak Elguess, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown senior producer said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">a statement to Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<p>“I’m extremely proud of our team’s work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success.</p>
<p>“Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter.</p>

<p>“Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise.</p>
<p>“We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future.”</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems that it simply didn’t sell well enough for Ubisoft’s liking – roughly 1 million copies, per Insider Gaming – when Ubisoft is looking to really maximise sales amid a string of disappointment bigger budget titles. Perhaps part of the problem was having a higher price point when compared to indie metroidvania standouts – The Lost Crown was $50 – and not releasing on Steam would have hurt PC sales as well.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Montpellier is the lead studio on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which has been in development for what feels like forever. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">Insider Gaming reports</a> that the team has been spread across BG&amp;E2, Project Ovr, which is the next Ghost Recon game, and Project Steambot, a&nbsp;Rayman remake in development with Ubisoft Milan.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown launched in January and was an early highlight of the year. “Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the finest metroidvanias I’ve ever played,”<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/"> Ade wrote in our review</a>, “and a fantastic way to start 2024. Thrilling and kinetic platforming, thumping combat, and a vast game world that demands exploration, and makes it a joy to do. It’s time to kick nostalgia firmly in the unmentionables; this is the best Prince of Persia ever.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-gets-creepy-%E2%80%98the-cursed%E2%80%99-halloween-update.1017171/</guid>

			<p>Today, Hello Games has announced and released a new update for its ever-evolving open galaxy game No Man's Sky. This update is titled The Cursed and is obviously meant to be a creepy one, much like many of the Halloween events that are being launched across live games this week.</p>
<p>According to Hello Games, The Cursed is a new Expedition in which players struggle to keep a grip on reality while being haunted by visions and voices from another dimension. It is set in a twilight universe straddling the line between realities. Here, time can shift unexpectedly as day turns to night at an unnatural pace.</p>
<p>Players will employ the new Boundary StarShip while traveling this haunted universe. This StarShip is a flying saucer, the first available in No Man's Sky, and the team described it as a 'Giger-esque coil of tubes, pipes, and engines.'</p>
<p>In The Cursed, players must protect themselves from the eroding boundaries of reality. The player exosuit's regular hazard protection has been replaced for the occasion with a special Anomaly Suppressor, the key to survival as the universe collapses around you.</p>
<p>As players explore these haunted worlds, they may encounter ghostly beings that drift across the boundaries. Sometimes, these spectral anomalies will be merely observant; on other occasions, they can become much more hostile. These encounters will introduce players to new, challenging enemies and boss battles on an unprecedented scale in No Man's Sky.</p>

<p>While playing The Cursed Expedition, travelers won't have access to hyperdrive technology, meaning no warping between star systems. Instead, interstellar travel requires careful planning and the use of an ancient portal network. Moreover, from another dimension, players will hear haunting voices offering guidance, information, strange blueprints, and secrets. Players must reflect on who these voices belong to, where they come from, and whether they can be trusted. Completing The Cursed will provide players exclusive spooky rewards, including exosuit customization inspired by Cthulhu-esque, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship. This No Man's Sky Expedition begins today and lasts approximately three weeks.</p>

<p>Hello Games also said in the press release that the previous update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-finally-adds-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquarius</a>, which introduced fishing to the game, was yet another success. Overall, 2024 is shaping up to be one of the biggest years for No Man's Sky in terms of popularity, and the British studio has promised 'several more surprises' in the remaining weeks before the end of the year, including the PS5 Pro enhancement patch available at launch on November 7.</p>

					<p>In most RPG mythology, the legendary heroes are folks to be revered and their stories tell of hope and a positive future. However, in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, those same Seven Heroes hare instead left behind a legacy of revenge and vile fiends roaming the land. It’s a narrative that brings some contemporary charm to an otherwise all-too-familiar mythology and this full 3D remake presents this groundbreaking JRPG in a whole new light.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Revenge.png"></a></figure>

<p>Following the passing of a family member at the hands of one of these legendary Seven Heroes, the Emperor (or Empress) of Avalon vows revenge against these heroes and to cleanse the world of their influence. From humble beginnings of a small empire nestled away in the northwest corner of the world, the player will see Varennes grow into a global superpower by ridding the world of these Seven Heroes one by one and bringing countries rid of their troubles under one united flag.</p>
<p>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven promises an open-ended adventure and has some interesting ways to make good on that promise, while the limitations of the original Super Famicom release are still present in how the narrative is shaped. Guided by little more than a rumor or piece of advice from your chancellor at the start of each generation, players can venture out into the world however they see fit once news of some sort of goings-on is brought to the player’s attention. Players only need to journey through dungeons and open fields once to reach a new city before it’s added to the list of fast travel options. All of these paths tend to converge at the same end, so regardless of which order the world is liberated and which of the Seven Heroes are dispatched, there’s a very similar design to how these paths intersect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Combat.png"></a></figure>

<p>While not completely possible to see everything in a single playthrough, players can still complete a good 90-95% of the available quests in Revenge of the Seven during a single run if they so choose. I had somehow neglected to check up on an active volcano in an earlier generation and went back a generation or two later to see how things were going, only to discover another natural disaster awaiting a nearby village. Had I gone sooner, I would have been granted the opportunity to learn about Dark Magic if I followed a very specific story path. Alas, the island itself was saved and this critical quest was locked away for the remainder of the playthrough.</p>
<p>Note for note, bar for bar, Revenge of the Seven is largely a familiar retelling of this experimental JRPG throughout in spite of the overhaul that’s been done to the game’s mechanics. Familiar story beats follow the same narrative journey as players solve the issues plaguing the world left in the wake of the Seven Heroes taking their own form of revenge and unleashing hordes of demons unto the world. Pick up any strategy guide penned for the PlayStation 4/Vita pixel remake from 2016 and you’ll be able to at least follow the story along even if all of the treasure chests and maps have been overhauled for this full 3D remake.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Final-Emperor.png"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the non-linear nature promised in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, there’s a sort of guarantee to the flow of progression. Finding new places to explore or quests to undertake often takes little more than chatting up the bartender at a local tavern or speaking with the common people around each town. There isn’t much mystery as to where to get a new quest as eligible NPCs all have the same telltale question mark icon to indicate they have something to offer. Most every other NPC can be readily ignored unless the player wishes to get a little more flavor text to the world and the troubles ailing them.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes of Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is an invisible timer that counts down the end of one generation and the beginning of the next. It’s not the number of hours or minor quests completed that leads to the passage of time but rather world-shaping events and defeating any one of the Seven Heroes. Typically, three major quests are the sweet spot to undertake as the current Emperor before the throne must be abdicated, 150 or so years pass by, and a new Emperor is selected to ascend to the throne of Avalon. This same formal transfer of power also proceeds if the entire party is wiped out, rather than forcing the player into a Game Over scenario.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Scattered-Petals.png"></a></figure>

<p>In this transfer of responsibilities, players are given a pool of six or so heroes that can assume the title of Emperor and lead the expansion of Varennes. These options are pulled from any available quest that’s been unlocked with a few notable selections. For example, the marionette puppet Coppelia can only be selected for a single generation before she is passively discarded (if you do happen to come across her, a hidden rendition of Wipe Your Tears plays and you’re rewarded with her signature ability, Poker Face, which renders whoever is equipped with the ability complete immunity to status effects). Because of the random nature, there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive an option that comes with the weapon skills you’ve previously been leveling or even the right class to complete a particular quest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get the Corsair as an available option, thus leaving one specific quest incomplete as I was unable to have the maritime experience necessary for traversing the open seas.</p>
<p>Combat in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is perhaps its most notable and welcomed change from the original releases. Kawazu and his team have updated the battle system to be more in line with recent SaGa titles such as Minstrel Song and SaGa: Emerald Beyond. Fights take place on a shared timeline where individual Speed stats determine the turn order rather than moving as one complete unit and the timeline can provide insight as to when an enemy’s turn may be coming up or if they’re preparing a brutal attack. Save for a few key weapon skills or formations, there’s little that can be done with manipulating the timeline outside of buffing/reducing a character’s Speed stat. Magicks require no casting times, so they can be issued the same as regular attacks and Techs. Striking an enemy’s weakness fills a separate Overdrive gauge that serves as this SaGa entry’s form of a combo system. Once filled, heroes can tag the next party member in line to do a combined pair of Tech/Spell attacks pulled from a random list.</p>
<p>There’s some rhyme and reason to how these combinations are pulled out, typically with how weapon types or elements are used in tandem. It wasn’t uncommon for my Martial Artist-specialized Emperor to tag in the next party member to do a matching attack. For most of the adventure, players will be limited to just two players being linked together, but by way of finding the hidden Mr. S collectibles and adding more regions under the Empire’s banner, players can link together more party members and even gain a second Overdrive Gauge (which carries over between battles, so it can be beneficial to grind just a little bit before tackling a dungeon boss). Precious BP used to cast Tech and Spells alike is typically only recharged through one-time use checkpoints before boss encounters or by resting at an inn, although there are rare BP-restoring items that can be purchased or found in treasure chests. Romancing SaGa 2 isn’t like Persona or Metaphor where there’s a strict calendar dictating your movements, so returning to town to restock is often a viable option.</p>
<p>True to previous SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is not a JRPG where grinding is intended. While it is more lenient than its successors, there is still a persistent Battle Rank that ticks up as players progress the narrative and undergo a certain number of battles. This Battle Rank will affect the enemies that players come across, so while grinding in one spot might sound like a good idea initially to learn a few new Tech or raise a weapon’s skill, grinding too much can have the adverse effect of introducing enemies that are too challenging to defeat given the player’s current equipment and skills.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>There’s no true leveling system in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven and this holds true for either SaGa titles as well. In lieu of a stated character level, winning a battle will typically raise one of three stats for a character: their HP, their BP, and whatever Weapon/Spells they used (or if they didn’t have a chance to act, whatever they used in the last fight). Any other stat, such as Defense or one of the five core attributes, is instead increased through equipped gear. Using a particular Weapon or Spell Skill will not only raise the amount of damage done but also unlock the opportunity to have a sudden spark of inspiration, or ‘Glimmer”, and discover a brand new attack on the battlefield. Each Weapon type comes with its own unique list of Tech attacks to learn, most branching from one skill or another once the right conditions are met (typically the character’s Weapon Skill in combination with the enemy’s strength).</p>
<p>Glimmering one of these Techs not only adds it to that character’s list of skills but also can be passed along to future generations through the Empire’s Training Hall. All of that passive knowledge in the form of Weapon Skills and Techs is recorded in the imperial records, so that as time passes and a new generation begins, the cumulative knowledge is carried forth and the next generation might have the power needed to defeat one of the Seven Heroes. By the time I inherited the title of Final Emperor and was ready to finish the adventure, I had just under 1,000 HP, a Martial Arts skill around level 60, and could easily hit for 15-20,000 from a single GuanYin and much more if it was a critical hit or used in an Overdrive combo.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455640/Romancing_SaGa_2_Revenge_of_the_Seven/">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</a> features the same narrative and core gameplay under the hood, this 3D remake turns the influential JRPG into a brand new experience. For players who rightfully enjoyed Kawazu’s non-linear storytelling in prior SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is a must-play. Just make sure to dust off one of those old Super Famicom strategy guides if you plan to see all of the tourism and fiends that Avalon has to offer.</p>

<p>One of Akitoshi Kawazu's most experimental titles from the Super Famicom, Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven shows that a classic JRPG can be given a complete overhaul to turn into something brand new while still retaining its unique quirks and charm.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, per the patch notes, "Sims can WooHoo with the Grim Reaper again", so all you freaky&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>players who've been wanting to show Death how you really feel, this one's for you.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes have been made as part of this update, so you can read <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-10-22-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to know everything that's changed.</p>

<p>This update comes not long after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">an announcement</a> regarding the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>franchise's future back in September, wherein EA revealed that it had no plans for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon.</p>
<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>will continue to be supported and updated with regular patches like this one, as well as expansions like&nbsp;<em>Life and Death&nbsp;</em>and new Creator Kits made by community figures.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-sims-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-sims-4/c08jxnk0vg5l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-dev-cancels-failing-kickstarter-and-announces-another-game-in-the-same-breath<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"After careful analysis and discussion."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Day Before developer Fntastic has cancelled its failing Kickstarter for one game and announced another in the same breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fntastic, who released the utterly disastrous The Day Before in December 2023 before pretending to shut down, resurfaced in September asking for money for a new game: the physics based multiplayer game Escape Factory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has now cancelled this project, however, after it reached just 15.73% of its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory/description" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> goal with $3,146 raised of a $20,000 goal. "Our campaign on Kickstarter is unlikely to reach our goal," Fntastic said in a statement published to <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> announcing another game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After careful analysis and discussion with the team, we have decided that our Escape Factory project has not generated enough interest," it said. The Kickstarter reached the 15.73% mark after four weeks. "With this in mind, we have decided to temporarily suspend work on Escape Factory and postpone it until a more appropriate time."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After careful analysis and discussion with the team, we have decided that our Escape Factory project has not generated enough interest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fntastic is now allegedly working on Items, an action horror prop hunt game. "Your wishes are very important to us," it said. "This is exactly what many of you have been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Kickstarter was announced but Fntastic said it may return to the crowdfunding route "or explore other options" once a demo for the game is made. Development will "require significant resources" so Fntastic has "decided to release mobile games" to support the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All funds generated from these apps will go directly into development," it said. "We believe this will help us create the game of your dreams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The term "dream" was often used in Fntastic's marketing for The Day Before. "We hope that after the game's success, we’ll give people faith that in this life, if you persevere toward a dream, it will come true, despite all the obstacles and doubts," Fntastic told IGN in January 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Day Before launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-review">an almost impossibly rare 1/10 in IGN's review</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-fntastic-announces-closure-just-days-after-early-access-launch">its shutdown was announced</a> just four days after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-player-count-drops-almost-90-in-4-days-enters-steams-10-worst-reviewed-games-list">it launched in Early Access</a>. It was one of the most controversial and catastrophic game launches in recent memory (now joined by PlayStation 5's Concord) as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-accused-of-copying-other-games-again">what was touted as the "next generation of post-apocalyptic MMO open-world survival games"</a> was released as a barebones and broken extraction shooter.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Strange Saga of The Day Before</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Steam's most wishlisted game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strange-saga-of-the-day-before">suspicion mounted around The Day Before and Fntastic</a> as time went on. It announced delay after delay amid revelations <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-developer-steam-most-wishlisted-game-defends-unpaid-volunteers">the studio used unpaid workers to develop its games</a>, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strange-saga-of-the-day-before">a trademark dispute caused more issues</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Allegations the entire game was a scam then emerged from the disgruntled fanbase, made worse by the myriad copycat accusations against Fntastic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-accused-of-copying-other-games-again">Shots in its trailers and screenshots lined up almost perfectly with other games</a> such as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, a trailer for The Day Before used the phrase: "Welcome to the next generation of post-apocalyptic MMO open-world survival games like never before. Immerse yourself in The Day Before." Alongside not making grammatical English sense, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cyberpunk-2077-world-explainer-gameplay-trailer">Cyberpunk 2077's Official Gameplay Trailer</a>, published years earlier in 2020, used the very similar phrasing: "Welcome to the next-generation of open-world adventure. Immerse yourself in Cyberpunk 2077."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/red-dead-redemption-2-official-gameplay-trailer">Red Dead Redemption 2's Official Gameplay Video</a>, published even further back, used the phrases "...to make combat deep and engaging at all times. Each weapon has unique characteristics, with realistic reload and recoil." A trailer for The Day Before used: "...to ensure that combat remains deep and engaging at all times. Each weapon boasts unique characteristics, as well as realistic reload and recoil mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are just two examples of myriad accusations with similar weight, but Fntastic denied any wrongdoing, leaned on the "fake news" defence, and implied the accusations were just an attempt at attention seeking. "We all live in a time of disinformation and lack of fact-checking," it said following the second wave of accusations. "Anyone can say anything for views, and everyone will believe it," it said. "Disinformation needs to be dealt with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fntastic has put out plenty of disinformation and blatant lies of its own, however, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-devs-say-delay-was-planned-before-trademark-dispute">saying the aforementioned trademark dispute caused a delay</a> when one was planned all along, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-fntastic-announces-closure-just-days-after-early-access-launch">saying the studio was shutting down</a> before announcing another game just months later. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-dev-promises-refunds-tells-customers-st-happens">"S**t happens," it told fans</a> who were frustrated with the misleading information and failure of The Day Before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
