			<p>When Game of Thrones Kingsroad was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-an-action-adventure-rpg-set-in-westeros-but-its-only-for-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased</a> at The Game Awards 2024, I didn't go easy on it. As a big fan of G.R.R. Martin's magnum opus, I've coveted a proper, triple-A rendition for well over a decade. This, a mobile game first and foremost, clearly wasn't it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I feel about it, the game's development is progressing, and now Netmarble has shared a gameplay sneak peek that's definitely more promising than the previous trailer. We can see the clear inspiration from action/adventure games like the latest Assassin's Creed titles, and there's even Lady Olenna herself warning our main character, a noble who suddenly finds himself the heir to a minor House, that he 'gravely underestimates the game' the big Houses play.</p>
<p>Along with the brief gameplay video, Netmarble also announced a Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test kicking off in just a few days, on January 16, and running through January 22 in the United States, Canada, and select parts of Europe (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Turkey, Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Ukraine, Denmark, Ireland, Romania, Finland, Portugal, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Croatia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania).</p>

<p>Signups are open on this page for Android and Windows PC. That's right, there will be a PC launcher to play the game on the platform. These are the required specs for the Game of Thrones Kingsroad Closed Beta Test:</p>

<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April last year</a>, but we've learned very little since then, making these pictures - which include a rusty sign of the toy animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, and my girl Chica - particularly exciting for some.</p>
<p>It's still unclear if the upcoming movie will be faithful to the second game's prequel timeline which takes place in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>A fan has also allegedly <a href="https://x.com/katsterlingfan/status/1878219889090982325">spotted</a> "some FNAF merch being sold for a possible scene" in the sequel, too.</p> <div>

<p>Whilst not remotely official - so take all this with a healthy dollop of salt - these photos were reportedly taken in River Town, outside of New Orleans. Whilst the OP originally thought it little more than "a little [local] fair" and nothing special, they later saw signs indicating that the area would be closed to the public by 3pm, and then signs for "Extras" and "a bunch of trailers". So make of that what you will.</p><div>

			<p>While Ubisoft has disappointed fans this week with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Assass</a>i<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">n's Creed Shadows release delay</a>, at least there's some new info about the title's first DLC.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft had recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/">announced another delay to the next AC project</a>, pushing it up to March 20, with the goal of providing a better game at launch. While Ubisoft's justification indeed sounds fishy, we won't dive into much, but things aren't looking good for the developer at all, as the firm is under a cost-reduction process and is already exploring potential sale options, putting the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows and the general franchise at stake. Out of all the negativity, there's something positive too, as we now have information about AC Creed Shadows' first DLC, reportedly called "Claws of Awaji.<em>"</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Interestingly, details about the DLC surfaced on the title's Steam page, but it has unfortunately been removed for now. Based on what Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/">reports</a>, here is the new description, which includes specifics about the first DLC of the title:</p>
<p><em>Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.</em></p>
<p>The description indicates that we are looking at 10 hours of downloadable content featuring a new region, likely the titular "Awaji Island," along with additional weaponry, gear, and abilities. Moreover, it seems like this particular DLC might be confined to users who have pre-ordered the title, but this isn't certain for now. Given that Ubisoft has received massive backlash around such moves before and that the description has now been removed from Steam, the devs are probably working on switching up their choice of words.</p>
<p>We do hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows delivers on expectations, especially considering that the title has now been delayed several months from the original schedule. It would be certainly very bad for Ubisoft if it didn't, especially after the streak of unsuccessful launches it has gone through so far.</p>

            <p>Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has doubled down on its assertions that it is not a Chinese military company, saying that if the US Department of Defense does not "resolve any misunderstanding", it will "undertake legal proceedings".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">public statement</a> - which the company said it makes on a "voluntary basis" - it stressed the firm was "neither a Chinese military company nor a military-fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base" and that while the allegation "does not affect [Tencent's] business", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">the US Department of Defense made a "mistake" when it publicly classified the firm as a Chinese military company</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the company insisted that the inclusion on the list was simply a misunderstanding, but this subsequent statement takes a much firmer line, saying: "The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake.</p>
<p>"During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the company from the CMC List. The company will make further announcement(s) as and when appropriate."</p><p>As Tom reminded us when this first bubbled up last week, Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous.

<p>A development build for Titan Quest 2 has been leaked online. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://en.gamegpu.com/game/v-set-utekla-sborka-titan-quest-2-beta-3-1-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameGPU</a>, the build is a beta version of the game from early November. This build, dupped Beta 3.1, doesn’t feature any multiplayer aspects. Rather, it’s deployment was for internal testing of various gameplay features. You can watch some of the leaked gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVIDMQ_DNYQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if you’d like</a> should it not be taken offline.</p>



<p>Obviously, it’s not a final build of the game and players should expect changes between what they see and what they’ll get.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games for comment on the reported leak. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>



<p>A sequel to 2006’s Titan Quest, fans have been waiting nearly 20 years for the next game in the series. The mythology-themed action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t feature any</a> pay-to-win or loot boxes, according to its developers.</p>



<p>“We do despise this with a passion,” Grimlore Games said. “There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.”</p>



<p>Regarding its planned early access release, they added that they want players involved from the start, and for the game to “stand its own ground”.</p>



<p>“We want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence,” they said.</p>



<p>Titan Quest 2 is scheduled to launch in sometime in 2025, and will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An exact release date has yet to be announced. </p>

<p>Speedrunners came from all over the world to "race through a bevy of games new and old", often with "zany incentives and challenges to drive donations", including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk">full-blown live concert</a> during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Dr. Doot playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> with a saxophone as a controller - which is embedded above - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmrIvD1UNFI">an opera performance by trained singer Xem</a> after completing his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>: Going Commando run. </p>

<p>The latest trailer for Atomfall, Rebellion’s upcoming open-world survival shooter, has emerged online. It’s a seven-minute trailer that explores the game’s core mechanics, including interactions with NPCs, crafting and upgrading items, traversing quests, and dealing with factions.</p>



<p>It’s a fantastic glimpse into this upcoming title, which is set to be released in March and is coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. I was fortunate to play Atomfall at Gamescom and speak to the developers – I can attest to how stellar this game is.</p>



<p>And yes, it’s kind of like Fallout in the UK.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall is <strong>kind of </strong>like Fallout, but it’s perfectly unique. It’s set in the UK’s Lake District, which means it’s an idyllic game with gorgeous vistas and sumptuous, lush environments. It’s an alternate history game, taking the real-world Windscale Nuclear Disaster of 1957 and making it something otherworldly and almost ethereal.</p>



<p>From tussling with brutal ‘raiders’ in above-ground post-apocalyptic settlements to diving into twisted, horrifying bunkers, Atomfall promises to offer a varied and diverse experience. It’s all about survival, and that means that the typical mechanics you’d expect are present:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scavenging, buying, and bartering for resources</li>



<li>Upgrading and repairing weapons and other items</li>



<li>Looting and trading across the open world</li>



<li>Building a character that suits your playstyle</li>



<li>Managing weight, health, and tools</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

<p>I’m a huge Fallout fan, and I’m mourning the immense weight on our plates until Fallout 5 comes out. While Atomfall isn’t technically a <strong>fully </strong>post-apocalyptic game set in a nuclear wasteland, it’s damn close. Most importantly, it <strong>looks </strong>like a Fallout game, featuring robots, some bizarre weapons, kooky faction members, and a branching, winding story filled with side content.</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s a blend between Fallout and STALKER.</p>



<p>When I played Atomfall at Gamescom, I was immediately won over. Not only does it look stunning, but it plays well, and as it’s a survival game at heart, decision-making is key. Should you take a cricket bat and try to overpower a guard in a settlement to get a gun before using a few rounds to fight the others, or should you try and stealth-kill everyone in the camp? Or avoid it entirely? It’s up to you.</p>



<p>Atomfall will be released on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC on March 27.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Atomfall? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/force-dei-in-gaming-ci-games-company/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-is-the-latest-company-to-rebel-against-%E2%80%98forced-dei%E2%80%99.1080219/</guid>

<p>Recently, Arrowhead Studios’ CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke out against forcing DEI into games. He explained that ‘if it doesn’t add to the game experience, it detracts’, suggesting that titles with forced DEI aren’t ‘good games’.</p>



<p>Now, CI Games, the publisher behind Lords of the Fallen, has taken a similar stance against DEI in gaming. In a recent investors chat, the company’s global marketing director, Ryan Hill, took an authoritative tone, clearly stating that the company won’t integrate ‘any social or political agencies into these experiences’ because it’s just too risky.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-many-players-do-not-appreciate-this">‘Many Players Do Not Appreciate This’</h2>



<p>In a statement secured by <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> during a recent CI Games investor call, Ryan Hill, who heads up marketing on a global scale for the firm, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While some videogames have recently taken the opportunity to embed social or political agendas within their experiences, it is clear that many players do not appreciate this, and as a result, we have seen a number of high profile releases underperforming commercially during the last year alone.</p>



<p>Our games will always be developed to maximise player enjoyment and commercial success, and as such, we will not be integrating any social or political agencies into these experiences going forward having observed the high risk this can present.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt, Hill recognised that ‘shoehorning’ DEI into games to tick a box or fulfil an agenda can do more harm than good, as we’ve seen in recent years. It’s one of the reasons why many games are labelled ‘woke’ and subsequently review-bombed.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on social media, CI Games’ CEO, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1877836661305819433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marek Tyminski</a>, reiterated that the company <strong>will not </strong>integrate DEI elements in their games just to fit a political or social agenda.</p>



<p>Do you think forced DEI is a huge problem in games, or is it being blown up too much? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>NetEase's free-to-play superhero shooter Marvel Rivals continues to perform extremely well. Its launch month <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was already great</a>, having registered over 20 million players across all platforms, but the debut of Season 1 has pushed it even further. A few hours ago, the game pulverized its <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prior concurrency record</a> (480K players) on Steam, setting a new peak at 644K online players on Valve's platform, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The first season began just two days ago with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-begins-january-10-adds-fantastic-four-to-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrival of the Fantastic Four</a>: Mister Fantastic (who has been assigned to the Duelist class in the game), Human Torch (also a Duelist), the Thing (Vanguard), and the Invisible Woman (Strategist). The addition of these highly popular Marvel characters, who are soon getting their own movie in the MCU, is sure to be a big reason for the further surge in popularity.</p>
<p>But there's more. The developers have added an all-new game mode titled Doom Match. Here, 8 to 12 players battle on a single map, each belonging to a different faction, and all factions are hostile to each other. Players earn points by knocking out enemies, and at the end of the match, the top 50% of players by default is considered the winning side.</p>
<p>Season 1 also introduced a seasonal event called Midnight Features. Players can complete the seasonal activities to unlock limited-time rewards, including exclusive galleries, costume, spray, unit, nameplate, and more. Starting yesterday, Twitch users may even unlock exclusive Drop rewards, such as the Hela: Will of Galacta spray, nameplate, and costume, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/unnamed-1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Needless to say, Season 1 came with its own Battle Pass, which features more than twice the amount of content of the Season 0 pass, according to NetEase. The so-called Eternal Night Fall Luxury Battle Pass includes 10 costumes and their related content, such as sprays and emotes.&nbsp; The price for the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass is set at 990 Lattice and players will receive 600 Lattice and 600 Units back by completing it. The good news is that the developers have introduced a mechanism for Battle Pass and Chrono Tokens that ensures that Luxury Battle Passes never expire. Moreover, Tokens purchased with Lattice are retained under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Chinese website Game Look <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> an estimate of how much Marvel Rivals might have earned in its first month. They anticipated $54.5 million earned through Steam, $27.2 through PlayStation 5, and $2.7 through Xbox Series S|X. Considering that it's also available on the Epic Games Store and through its own PC client, Game Look believes total earnings outside China were around $100 million. When factoring in the estimated earnings from the Chinese version of the game, the total goes up to $136 million. Should the game keep up this pace, it could turn into a franchise capable of earning over $1 billion per year, although that would be no small feat, since live service games often experience downturns in player interest.</p>
<p>By the way, Marvel Rivals can now be played via NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud platform, and it has been confirmed that support for NVIDIA's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> tech for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards will be coming soon.</p>

            <p>Four and a half years after it was announced, EA's free-to-play skate sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate">Skate</a>, is finally ready for playtesting on consoles.</p>
<p>Early adopters who signed up to Skate's early access Insider programme are now receiving invitations to get involved in the playtest and "help shape the future of the game".</p>

<p>When developer Full Circle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">first began sharing details</a> of its new Skate project - which is officially known as Skate, rather than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-4">Skate 4</a> - back in 2022, the studio explained it wasn't "a sequel", nor "a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel". Instead, it was described as an "authentic evolution" of the series intended to reflect "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".</p>
<p>Skate will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, PC (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-stake-is-coming-to-pc-via-steam">including Steam</a>), and mobile devices when it releases in early access later this year - some 15 years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-3">Skate 3</a>. It will also boast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The French Revolution is an ideal period of history to set a video game. Warring factions, apocalyptic-like societal collapse, buckets of gore, surely everything a good video game story needs. Sadly, Liberté entirely fails to capitalise on the juicy era in which it is set. Indeed, it succeeds accidentally in only one aspect, just like the French Revolution, Liberté is an absolute mess.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberte - PlayStation Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXli7PqJeC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ostensibly a top-down isometric hack n’ slash action RPG, Liberté is best described as an experience to be avoided. Visually the game is lumbered with the blocky, charmless visuals of a bad PS2 game. Despite the rudimentary graphics however, Liberté made my PS5 sweat like a member of the aristocracy paying a visit to Madame Guillotine. Frequent painful frame drops, several second freezes, and ominous black loading screens plague the far too long run time. Characters regularly drop in and out of existence, as if they are teleporting, only they shouldn’t be. At points, Liberté isn’t far off being unplayable.</p>


<p>Combat is basic and tedious, with no sense of impact from attacks. Player character Rene goes up against the same obviously cloned French Soldiers again and again. A dash and a combo or two are your lot, but frankly, so easy is the game that these skills are likely all you’ll need to storm through each tiny mostly linear level. Like a peasant rampaging through the Bastille, the game offers no resistance. Oh, other than by crashing and wiping out all your progress of course.</p>


<p>Liberté has one good idea, and even that it bungles. Rene is awarded abilities by acquiring cards from a deck. To activate the abilities, the player must elect to destroy a number of the cards in order to equip a favoured power-up. It could be a neat risk and reward mechanic, requiring the player to carefully consider the combat situation they are facing and respond accordingly. Problem is, your initial combo is so effective you don’t even need to use your abilities. Worse still, these powers, despite sounding cool – wielding a guitar as a weapon, lobbing a multitude of axes – visually they are limp and indistinct, offering no thrill in their use at all.</p>
<p>The story is nonsensical, the dialogue resolutely boresome, the characters flat and vapid, and the whole experience feels like little has changed since the game was in early access two years ago.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Avoid Liberté like a one-way ticket to the Guillotine. Instead, if you want to experience the French Revolution, read a book instead. It will be more interactive, the loading times will be much improved, and the graphics will probably be better too.	</p></div>
