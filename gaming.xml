		<p>Bungie have finally revealed their new version of Marathon, a team-based extraction shooter set on the world of Tau Ceti 4. While the gunplay looks classic Bungie the art style is bright and rather cartoonish with chunky 8-bit style fonts and glitching effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZRGDZCl9pg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will have up to eighteen players battling it out alongside AI enemies but while you can be in a team of three, you can opt out of matchmaking and play solo if you wish. The idea is to grab as much loot and escape, die and your loot will be dropped and claimed by someone else. More loots means a better loadout on the next run.&nbsp; The game will feature “events” which have yet to be detailed, dynamic weather, end game content, community events and seasonal stories. Each runner will have implants which you can use to enhance shields, agility and other abilities.</p>

<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

<p>Marathon will launch on September 23rd 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S, and PC.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of Kiddy Apex Lege.. erm, I mean Marathon? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Almost two years after it was first revealed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> have released a first-look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot's gameplay. And you know what? Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's looking really good! And it's out September 23rd! Much like the reveal trailer it's incredibly stylish, there's this clean, almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> like quality to its world, but we've had hints of that already. The big thing is the gameplay, which looks like more of that chunky, Bungie, first-person shooting goodness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In terms of how matches work, you can form teams of up to three people as you head out to collect loot. Dying normally means losing any loot you've collected, but if you manage to get out successfully you can hang on to it for future runs. Matches can have up to 18 players, though it sounds like there won't necessarily be that many all the time, as you can even go solo if you like.

At launch there'll be six runners to choose from, but Marathon won't just be about the gameplay, as there'll be seasonal storytelling events too. Also, no idea why, but all of these details were delivered to us from Final Fantasy 16's own Ben Starr. Can't complain though, great voice!
</p>
<p>
The thing you'll probably most be interested in, though, is that the game is getting a closed alpha. This kicks off April 23rd and runs until May 4th, but there's a catch: it's for North America only. Perhaps a bit annoying for the rest of us, but I've never known gamers to be anything but a patient bunch. You'll have to join the game's official Discord to sign-up.
</p>
<p>
I'm really not much of a shooter person, they've never clicked with me honestly, but boy howdy does Marathon's sci-fi world look like it might change things for me. One concern I do have is that Bungie are obviously known for vaulting a large portion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s story - so much so it <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/lets-close-some-tabs-bungie-nintendo-like-a-dragon-dino-crisis">had to use fan made videos in a court case</a> to show off the game's story - that I can't help but wonder how they'll handle Marathon. I guess we'll find out in due time!
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, you can watch a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlC31D_Rr-Y?si=GeF-7H49-3lRQSGk">highlight reel</a> of a bunch of YouTubers and Twitch streamers playing the game to get more of a feel of moment to moment gameplay. Just watch out for that Geoff Keighley jumpscare.

It was all narrated with incredible gravitas <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909708108282151044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909708108282151044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Balatro</em> clown Ben Starr</a></span> and culminated in a September 23 release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC with full cross-play. (Yes, <em>Marathon</em> is going <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044">head-to-head with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span>).</p><p>The top-level pitch is this: You play as a cybernetic mercenary called a runner who takes contracts to scavenge the remains of a lost colony on Tau Ceti IV. It’s PvPvE, so players will have to fight one another as well as AI-controlled UESC security forces and “otherworldly threats” to loot facilities and complete their objectives. If they successfully extract, they grow in power and new gear gets added to a vault to be taken out and used on the next mission, but if they get wiped on the surface everything gets left behind. There’s also a tease for higher-stakes gameplay aboard the derelict Marathon ship orbiting the planet, potential endgame content <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">that calls back to Bungie’s original trilogy by the same name</a></span> that suggests linkages that long-time fans will have fun unraveling.</p><p> The overall structure of <em>Marathon</em> sounds like it will be familiar to <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> players and fans of other extraction shooters, with some unique wrinkles. By default players will be grouped into squads of three but can also play solo, with up to 18 total appearing on a given map at once. Every match has its own time limit forcing players into action, and dynamic weather and other random events will add extra chaos to the proceedings. Any loot you extract with gets added to a vault to be used in future runs, though if it’s ever lost in a team wipe, it’s lost for good. </p><p>What about the moment-to-moment gameplay? The core of <em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s snappy and crunchy gunplay, which if it’s anything like<em> Destiny 2</em>'s will be top-shelf when it comes to first-person shooters, but with a bunch of new tactical and strategic elements to take into consideration given the battle-royale nature of the showdowns. Players are downed instead of immediately killed, and a revive system means death isn’t the end of a run. Bungie also said that “sponsored packages” from various corporate factions will give players a baseline loadout needed to stay competitive. </p><p>And of course there will be custom builds and abilities. We saw four different runner characters—Locus, Blackbird, Glitch, and Void—each with unique looks, playstyles, and abilities that can offer an extra edge. There will be unique stats for different characters, as well as customization when it comes to implants, cores, weapons, weapon attachments. A toxin upgrade by poison opponents, or players could equip something to boost their resistance to it. And Marathon will have it’s own version of Destiny’s rarest Exotics loot that offers the “best” version of a particular archetype. </p><p> The gameplay footage shows one sniper character turning invisible, similar to Hunters from <em>Destiny 2</em>, while equipment like grenades, shields, and medkits offer other characters different support roles. “You’re always free to experiment with team compositions, and the only limit to how you want to play your runner is your loot and imagination,” Starr’s narrator voice promises. It sounds like a lot to balance, and the proof will be in whether player experimentation proves to be truly viable, or if <em>Marathon</em> quickly coalesces around a narrow range of try-hard build-crafting metas.</p><p>Player progression will be another interesting test. Most of it will be account-wide rather than class-dependent, with faction ranks unlocking access to different upgrades and black market merchandise (all purchased with in-game currency) and completed contracts expanding vault space. Beyond the matches themselves, there are endgame challenges, ranked play, community events, and seasonal storytelling. Perhaps the most dramatic thing about <em>Marathon</em> is that it will largely reset players’ vaults at the end of each season to provide a more level playing field going into the next. It’s the logical thing to do for fairer play but might also be exactly the type of thing to turn off more casual fans. </p><p><em>Marathon </em>will be Bungie’s first new project in over a decade and its first new game as part of PlayStation, where the reported underperformance of <em>Destiny 2</em> led to multiple rounds of deep cuts in the last two years. (The previous game director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">was also fired in early 2024</a></span>). <em>Marathon</em> is facing an uphill climb for sure, especially a year after Sony’s other big live-service push, <em>Concord</em>, proved how brutal the multiplayer space is these days. But maybe Bungie’s extraction shooter will be more like <em>Helldivers 2</em>—infectious in its uncompromising focus on one hardcore gameplay loop. <em>Marathon</em> certainly <em>looks</em> like it has the juice. Hopefully, it ends up playing like it does too. A closed alpha test is set to begin on April 23.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bungie has revealed how Runners will work in Marathon, who they are, are what their class type does.</p>



<p>It’s been confirmed that their will be six individual ‘Runners’ on launch, with Bungie confirming four of them during the Marathon Gameplay showcase.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-runners-work">How Runners Work</h2>



<p>Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter, where the player will need to choose one of six (at launch) Runners to use. In the lore of the game, a Runner is a cybernetic mercenary who’s given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell. </p>



<p>The gist? Each of the Runners have their own unique abilities and attributes catering to different playstyles. The goal of the game is to scavenge the map for the best loot and extract.</p>



<p>Before you join a game, you’ll pick a Runner and build your loadout with the overall objective to get in, scavenge, and extract alive.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-are-the-runners-in-marathon">Who Are The Runners in Marathon?</h2>



<p>So far, Bungie has confirmed that there will be six different Runners coming to the game on launch, but they have only revealed four.</p>



<ul>
<li>Locus – Locus is the games “soldier” class who is suited towards players with a more aggressive playstyle.</li>



<li>Blackbird – Blackbird is the games reconnaissance Runner, who can find where players are and strategically plan your next move.</li>



<li>Glitch – Glitch is all about disrupting the enemy by pushing forward, compromising them (details to be determined) and getting out.</li>



<li>Void – Void is the games Stealth class, with active camo and the ability to throw down smokes.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s currently unclear on what the other two Runners in Marathon will be, but logic suggests that one will at least be some kind of healer, while the other could be some kind of Tank/Brute character.</p>

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s ambitious and energetic extraction shooter, poised to disrupt a relatively tired genre that has been dominated by a single game for far too long. The team at Bungie has worked tirelessly over several years to produce a remarkably unique title that might not look like a typical extraction shooter, but it definitely plays like one.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything we know about Marathon, including the game’s release date, gameplay loop, extraction shooter model, and when the closed alpha will take place.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marathon">What is Marathon?</h2>



<p><strong>Marathon is a first-person shooter built around an extraction model</strong>. That means that players kit up, enter a map, and fight to survive against other players and AI enemies. They’ll complete tasks, loot items, and try to stay alive, as death means failure and the loss of everything they’ve acquired.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters are typically intense and very challenging, but Marathon will have a much more ‘arcade-style’ aesthetic and operating model. It’ll utilise fast-paced movement mechanics and powerful abilities to make it stand apart from the milsim extraction shooters we’re used to seeing.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s release date was revealed <strong>as being September 23, 2025</strong>. The price of Marathon hasn’t been confirmed just yet, which means we don’t know if it’ll be a free game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marathon-alpha">When is the Marathon Alpha?</h2>



<p>The Bungie team revealed that the <strong>closed alpha for Marathon starts on April 23, 2025</strong>. It’ll start as an invite-only event, with passes being allocated to specific users. From there, priority codes will be issued, and those who access the alpha will be able to invite two friends.</p>



<p>If you want to access the alpha, it begins with jumping into the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon Discord server</a> and completing a survey.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-coming-to-console">Is Marathon Coming to Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only released on PC platforms, but <strong>we already know that Marathon is coming to Xbox and PlayStation</strong>. This was known ahead of the grand reveal that took place on April 12.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-marathon-gameplay-look-like">What Does Marathon Gameplay Look Like?</h2>



<p>Marathon’s gameplay loop is typical for an extraction shooter. Players start their game up and load out as they see fit, equipping weapons, upgrades, shields, grenades, attachments, and more. They’ll pick a ‘Runner’, a cybernetic individual with unique perks and skills, and then they’ll pick a map.</p>



<p>From there, it’s a fight to survive, with players exploring the map they’ve chosen, trying to complete tasks and successfully win their fights to eventually get the chance to <strong>leave the map</strong>.</p>

                <p>Bungie's new shooter Marathon was the focus of a livestream event today in which the company shared lots of new information about it, including a release date. Marathon will launch on September 23, which is the same day that Gearbox's highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> arrives. It's expected that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">GTA 6 will follow soon after, potentially in October. </a></p><p>Marathon, which is a successor to Bungie's 1994 game of the same name, is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. The game supports cross-play and cross-saves for all platforms.</p><p>Also during the livestream event today, Bungie announced that a closed alpha test for Marathon will begin in April--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/" data-ref-id="1100-6530808">here's how to sign up for the Marathon closed alpha.</a></p><p>Bungie showcased Marathon's first alpha gameplay footage during the livestream today.</p><p>The game takes place on the world of Tau Ceti IV. Players take on the role of a "Runner," described as a cybernetic mercenary who is searching the world for "fortune and power." Playing in groups of three, players will face off against other groups of Runners, along with AI enemies. The goal, like in other extraction games, is to survive with scavenged materials and extract to safety, then doing it all over again.</p><p>Runners can be customized with different weapons, equipment, and "implants" that augment how they play. Teams will need to work together strategically to assemble their squads for the best chance of success.</p><p>As part of its Season 1 roadmap, Marathon will have endgame challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more, Bungie said.</p><p>Bungie also revealed a Marathon cinematic short written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (Tron: Uprising, Love, Death &amp; Robots). The cast in the cinematic short includes Erica Lindbeck as Glitch, Elias Toufexis as Void, Nika Futterman as Blackbird, Donnla Hughes as ONI, and Ben Starr as Narrator.</p><p>For lots more, be sure to read GameSpot's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">hands-on Marathon preview</a>.</p>

<section><p>Marathon feels like it'll deliver satisfying gameplay, but the experience around it could leave a lot to be desired</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I've been trying to distill my thoughts and feelings about playing Marathon into something easily communicable and I keep coming back to Season 6, Episode 13 of The Simpsons. In the episode, titled "And Maggie Makes Three," Homer learns that he's become a father for the third time and, in response, reacts with a despondent thumbs up that simultaneously acknowledges that something good has happened but that it also creates the potential for stress, hardship, and maybe even disappointment. I hate to reduce playing an alpha version of the next game from the team behind Halo and Destiny to a reaction meme deployed by millennials in group chats, but the accuracy of what homersadthumbsup.jpg conveys is undeniable.</p><p dir="ltr">After around eight hours of gameplay where I faced off against developers, content creators, and members of the press, I left Bungie's Bellevue studio keen to play more of its high-stakes PvPvE multiplayer game. And at the same time, I couldn't deny that I had serious concerns about the experience that its compulsive gameplay loop is couched within. Putting it plainly, I'm worried Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Even in its alpha stage, what made playing Marathon so compelling was immediately evident. It took just one match of running, gunning, looting, and extracting to identify that the core of the experience leverages Bungie's pedigree as a best-in-class first-person-shooter developer. As longtime Halo or Destiny players can attest to, there's a satisfying texture in the moment-to-moment gameplay that makes Bungie's games hard to put down. The satisfying thump of a melee kill or the glee that comes from sticking an enemy with a plasma grenade has carried Halo through multiple generations. And deep loot-based progression layered on top of that gives Destiny a gravitational pull that's hard to escape. Marathon has all that, but within the framework of an extraction shooter. For those not familiar, this is a relatively new flavor of multiplayer shooter that takes the thrills of PvP and marries it with the tension of battle royale to create a game about dropping in, grabbing resources, and then making it to an extraction point to get out with your goodies in a single life.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the individual components of the genre are familiar territory for Bungie, but what makes it appealing for the team is the highly engaging risk-versus-reward format that treads some new ground for the studio while also leaning into the PvP roots that helped make its name.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us, the opportunity of an extraction shooter really comes from two parts," said game director Joe Ziegler. "One is that we have a team that's very excited to build it, and we also have this idea of how do we create the next step of Bungie but also harken back to some of the PvP roots that Bungie originally had with Halo and things of that sort?</p><p dir="ltr">"We're also doing something quite crazy experimental, if you will. We're trying to build a service that's like a PvPvE game where we can do a lot of the cool storytelling things that Bungie really does, but do it in the context of a game where a lot of the content is driven by players interacting with one another. I think that nexus of things really makes us very excited to create this experience for players."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether Marathon represents a bold new future for Bungie remains to be seen, but at this stage I can confidently say that its gameplay sits comfortably in the genre, feeling familiar but not so much as to be derivative of its past works. The framing of the PvP is in line with most modern extraction shooter or battle royale games: Multiple teams of three spawn into a map that is filled with loot that's up for grabs. Some of it is crafting materials, some of it is weapons of various rarities, and some of it is items that are associated with quests or objectives relevant to the game in progress or the overarching progression system. Matches can take anywhere between a minute if you're unlucky/bad to around 20-minutes if you’re lucky/good. Your backpack space is limited, so there are decisions to be made about the balance between what to keep and what to leave behind. You can fill your pockets with things that will be valuable later or things that could be necessary to your objectives now. Loading up on guns, ammo, and items to keep in your vault might make future runs less of an uphill struggle, but if you can't get it to the extraction point because you didn't grab enough health or shield recovery items and got jumped, you're going to end up losing it all anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">Tried-and-true shooting akin to Halo and Destiny is the bedrock of the game, while characters called Runners facilitate a variety of playstyles and team roles. Their various abilities are somewhat analogous to the skills and Supers employed by Destiny's Guardians or Apex’s Legends, but commonalities are more on a functional level than being impressive ways to live out a power fantasy. Marathon is much more grounded, and there's a weightiness to it that means it moves at a slower pace than its stablemates, which emphasizes the tactical flow that is intended to drive skirmishes. Movement is governed by a stamina meter that fills as you sprint and slide around, so things are a little more controlled--if you're expecting the floaty leaps or over-the-top abilities Destiny usually has, you're going to be disappointed.</p><p dir="ltr">Deliberate, grounded gameplay is crucial to the tension of most extraction shooters, and it serves that purpose in Marathon effectively. This, Bungie hopes, will reinforce the idea of making gameplay that feels different from its past games and creates moments that tell their own stories.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bungie is known for its very action-forward [gameplay]; that 30 seconds of fun is the phrase that's always been there with Halo and the extension of building your own superhero, if you will, with Destiny," explained gameplay director Andrew Witts. "For us, we're getting a little bit more into tactical action, which is something that Bungie's never dipped into. Part of that is that you have to introduce a little bit of friction, but good friction in a way where you want to get people to lean forward and feel the tension. In the past games, tension came from overwhelming odds, and this is overwhelming odds, but more from the intangibles of, 'Where is everything? I don't have the perfect information.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Ziegler added: "So much of it is driven from the pressure of the scenario. We think games become really meaningful, moments in games become meaningful, and the stories you tell become really meaningful when they have a certain amount of agency. You chose to do a bunch of things and then, the impact is really high. In some cases, some of the loops that we're trying to create really reinforce that idea of storytelling. For example, if you go in and play the game, you're really coming out going, 'This is my story. This is what happened to me and this is why it's cool because I overcame odds. I did this really cool thing and I got this unique story out of it that nobody did by surviving that session or by getting through the trials and tribulations of the session.' For us, that does mean going a little bit more tactful at times to make sure that the decisions that people are making have really clear consequences where it's like, 'Oh, I got destroyed by AI because I made the wrong move.'"</p><p dir="ltr">All of that bears out in the way the Runners are played. Although they have distinct abilities that are enabled by futuristic cybernetic technology, the impact of these are restrained just enough so that, when activated, they provide a small tactical advantage instead of enabling the user to bulldoze through enemies. Locus, for example, is essentially the vanilla soldier class. His abilities include launching shoulder-mounted missiles that home in on enemies to immobilize and do damage. He also has an energy barricade that can be held to block incoming damage but drains quickly when attacked. His movement ability is a short dash using boosters, and he has a faster sprint, which is regulated by the additional heat it generates. Of all the characters, Locus plays in the most predictable ways, but the alternative Runners don't mix things up significantly either.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout my playthrough, I found myself yearning for abilities that were a little more exciting. I don't need to soar into the sky and unleash a barrage of rockets or call in a sidekick named Bob to dish out some punishment when I hit a button, but everything I did in Marathon was very lacking in originality--again, closer to the character toolset from Apex Legends, which is well-trodden territory at this point. The upside of having Runners with relatively simple abilities, however, is the learning curve is very manageable, and it's very easy to understand what your enemies are capable of too. This, it turns out, makes the game much more approachable than its contemporaries, especially given how overwhelming other multiplayer games that have been running for years can be. For me, approachability is a key aspect of Bungie's games. Whether it's Halo or Destiny, the barrier to entry for gameplay is very low and, when it comes to getting to grips with mechanics, that looks to be the case for Marathon too. This is in contrast to the notoriously complex and finicky nature of most other extraction shooters.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think our ideal is that if you're really into PvP experiences and you really are excited by getting into the sandbox nature of play, this is an approachable way to enter that extraction shooter experience," Zeigler said. "Having said that though, is it more intense? In some ways, yes. It really depends on how you think about the Bungie audience.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to build, expand that audience into people who want to do some of these more survival-based, intense experiences, but not have to go through a lot of the finicky nature of what's being offered currently to make that happen. We are focused on approachability, definitely, but our approachability doesn't mean pulling from the depth of the experience, but more how we stage and remove some of the things from the front layers to get people to those really deep survival experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">"Approachability on the gameplay side of things is really about touchstones that people go, 'Okay, I know this roughly, this feels familiar,'" Witts continued. "That is a basis for people to learn versus just upfront obtuse mechanics. We're really trying to be recognizable and [have] the approach on that angle be one of 'I know Bungie games, what the base asks are, but this is very different in a way where it's demanding in this way or I have to take my time and be slow here and I can't just have push forward constantly.'"</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, in this early stage, it works. Marathon in its alpha phase is an extraction shooter that is easy to pick up and get into. It is satisfying to play and feels well made, as opposed to being eurojank held together by whatever the coding equivalent of gaffer tape is.</p><blockquote data-align="center" data-size="large"><p dir="ltr">I trust Bungie to make good on its ideas and realize its ambition in some form or another. Despite its rocky start, Destiny reached a much better place after the hard work put in to build on what was there.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In a genius move, each map in Marathon is also populated by AI-controlled robots that can be mowed down as you do your business and occasionally run into human opponents. This means that, even if you're not great at PvP, you are able to do the point-and-shoot stuff that feels good and gain experience and, hopefully, build the confidence to keep playing and getting better. Other games have these fodder-type enemies too, but what elevates Marathon's is their behavior. Bungie is known for creating foes that are an actual challenge and, if you're playing on higher difficulty, might even take you down. The same can be said of Marathon's roving AI enemies, who will run up on you, take cover, move between points, and even use high ground to get an advantage. Some of them, like the Commanders, can be deadly if not taken seriously, so I'm not ashamed to say that I got overwhelmed by them and team-wiped a few times during my sessions. For experienced players, the difference between AI and human is obvious, but for many the line between them won't really matter since they push back enough to make you feel like you earned the kill. The enemy behavior and the way they're used to boost confidence and build momentum for the player is genuinely one of the most impressive parts of Marathon.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major contributor to Marathon's polished exterior is its arresting visual aesthetic. It's easy–and accurate–to describe it as having a futuristic, techy feel with cool-looking, robotic humanoid characters that also look like they're part-time fashion designers, but there's a style and cohesion to it that is unique. Bungie used a lot of phrases to describe what they were going for, my favorites being "cyber simplicity" and "future less" because they really speak to an aesthetic that is built around being antithetical. Marathon is a bright and vibrant game that uses simplicity as its north star and graphic design as the basis for its visual language. It's visually busy and dense, but at the same time, easy to digest and appreciate; high-fidelity, low-poly industrial design, is what they call it. The Runners, meanwhile, have these eye-catching details and flair that give them personality, and it's inspired by sports fashion. Again, Bungie's own description is the most apt: Nike meets Teenage Engineering. Using my decidedly less eloquent approach: It looks kinda like if Metal Gear, Armored Core, and WipeOut had a baby. Don't ask me how three participants have one baby--it's the future; you figure something out.</p><p dir="ltr">Needless to say, every new screen is a visual feast of cool icons and 3D-printed-looking objects. And Perimeter, one of the two maps we played, has a kind of neon industrial vibe that reminded me of Mirror's Edge. It looks so good that when we switched to Dire Marsh, where a thick fog would occasionally roll in, it was a little annoying. Mostly because all the nice visuals were being covered up, but also because sneaky players used it as cover for jumpscares, leading to quick kills.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon makes a great first impression but, very quickly, what's not there becomes as impactful as what is. Having praised the gameplay extensively, I have to pivot and also point out that everything it is doing is very ordinary, but executed well. Although I enjoyed playing the game, it was very evident that it didn't have a hook; a special something that will help it stand out from the crowd; an X-factor that gives it a fighting chance in a crowded world of multiplayer games that demand all of your time and attention. I wouldn't go so far as to say it felt soulless, but it definitely felt like something was missing, that one more ingredient to bring it all together. Without that, numerous other games popped into my head as more exciting prospects. Admittedly, most of those games aren't extraction shooters, but when it comes to making commitments, I have to assume a large portion of the intended audience isn't going to make that distinction, so why should I? Ultimately, regardless of genre, Marathon will be competing for the same time and attention that people have given, and are still giving, to Overwatch, Apex Legends, Warframe, Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, The Division 2, Valorant, Destiny, Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, Call Of Duty, Counter-Strike, and many others. Those are games that people have hours, days, months, and years of investment in, so it's going to take something special to make them even consider switching or splitting attention, let alone pull them away. As it stands, I don't think Marathon currently has that.</p><p dir="ltr">What it does have is ambition. Repeating Ziegler's words from earlier: Marathon is being built as "a service that's like a PvPvE game where we can do a lot of the cool storytelling things that Bungie really does." None of that, however, was evident in what I played. And various other parts of the game that were highlighted as being key to Marathon, its appeal, and its longevity were ideas we didn't get to see firsthand. It was a lot of tell with very little show.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon takes place in Tau Ceti IV in the year 2893, when a cryptic message from the planet's colony causes panic. The Unified Earth Space Council is doing its best to keep the details of what happened to the colony a secret, but whatever happened has led to Runners--people who are essentially transferring their consciousness to external shells--to exploit the resources on the planet. Players will uncover secrets of the universe and what happened on Tau Ceti IV. I know that because Bungie told me, not because I saw any indication of it in-game. The narrative in-game manifested in a Faction system, where the player can take contracts from one of six groups that are vying for power? Control? Resources? I'm not quite sure. This is ostensibly a progression system where the contracts ask the player to complete objectives during a run and, in return, curry favor with the faction to build up a rank and, eventually, unlock upgrades that marginally improve things like how long it takes to decode items from loot boxes and death boxes. Each of the three factions had a very brief history about what their deal is, but beyond that there was little to dig into. As a taster of a metagame that feeds into character progression, it felt very detached from the character I was creating and the world I was in.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Bungie, each faction will have their own narrative mystery, but at this stage said narrative mystery wasn't there–beyond completing objectives, there was no other way to engage with the faction. It also seemed like I could work for multiple factions with no consequence. But whatever is going on will be explored in games, and the player will have a hand in shaping events, though I'm not clear how and, when I asked, I left thinking it involved having special items.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of the later contracts actually have interactive VO that is piped into you as it's happening and they have a little bit more intricate requirements for the contract as you're going through it," explained Zeigler. "The missions become harder and also, you feel a little bit more of the presence of the narrative being told around you. We have other elements, which are for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're working on a system that's more about collecting things and then, as you finish a collection, you get a bit of lore like a clue in the season to actually help you understand that.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing we really wanted to tie storytelling into is we didn't want the storytelling to dominate the player's experience, but to complement their own stories as they're telling it. There's things that are more related to what we called for a while, a digital detective strategy, which is the idea it's more about you going out there finding loot in the world, how does some of that loot help you tell the story that you want to, how do we create the context for you to tell the stories that you're going to be having of surviving that session rather than being no, everyone's playing a campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">"Part of our season model is actually to make it so as you're having these adventures and there are things that you are earning and commemorating at an account level. Some of which are achieved by you doing some crazy things with friends or things of that sort that unlock things, potentially cosmetics or things of that account level that will stay with you throughout the time.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea is every season should be a moment to go on adventures, commemorate them, and then, some of those commemorative elements you can use as expressive elements for yourself in the future, whether they be skins or titles or things like that as a new season starts--a new opportunity to go on a new adventure. Part of the burden on us in terms of thinking about the service is to make sure every adventure that every season offers is in and of itself different and feels different to create those new stories."</p><p dir="ltr">Again, this sounds potentially interesting to me as a certified item-description reader--but "potentially" is the operative word. I can't help but think back to the launch of Destiny, when the story was threadbare and explored via Grimoire Cards accessible outside of the game itself. And without any concrete narrative hooks visible in what I experienced of Marathon, it's hard to get excited about a major part of why I enjoy Bungie's games.</p><p dir="ltr">Witts continued: "We're taking some pretty big swings for what the middle and end of the season looks like and we're already starting to think about what's happening in the world? What are some consequences? How does that manifest into the decisions that players can make, interesting ways on the mercenary fantasy and all the different ways that happens? Am I just getting something and getting out? Am I trying to take out a specific enemy? Things like that and that add to more fidelity and choice."</p><p dir="ltr">The kicker here is that Marathon is going to launch as a premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price. Based on what I experienced and was told, it'll have a battle pass, three maps (with a fourth arriving shortly after launch); fun but no-frills gameplay; a story that currently is all very vague in its nature and unclear in its implementation; and a character-progression system that doesn't yet show signs of offering a meaningful sense of growth. Maybe it's there behind-the-scenes and will be ready for launch, but for whatever reason, a decision was made not to show it.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, I'd be remiss not to once again point out that this is an alpha build (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/" data-ref-id="1100-6530808">you'll be able to try it soon too</a>), so it could all be implemented in the period leading up to launch. But at the same time, Bungie's own language indicated that much of what surrounds Marathon's core gameplay hasn't been formed yet or won't come together until much later, or is subject to change. In most of our discussions, there was a very loose commitment to ideas and direction. By its own admission, the project has changed in significant ways over the years of development and that fluidity is part of the process but, for me, there was a concern about how defined and settled the vision for Marathon is. I can't pretend to know how game development works, but at the very least I think I can say it felt like there's a whole lot to do and not a lot of time to do it before its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/" data-ref-id="1100-6530810">September release</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475097" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475097"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475097-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475098,1300-4475099,1300-4475100,1300-4475101,1300-4475102,1300-4475103,1300-4475104" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475098-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475099-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475100-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_004.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475101-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_005.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475102-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_006.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475103-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_007.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4475104-2025_marathon_reveal_press_kit_compressed_008.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Either way, I trust Bungie to make good on its ideas and realize its ambition in some form or another. Despite its rocky start, Destiny reached a much better place after the hard work put in to build on what was there. Similarly, Destiny 2's ups and downs also brought with them incredibly memorable characters, stories, and moments. The gameplay of both games also evolved as time went on to become more intricate and engaging. Bungie has repeatedly shown a dedication to its games, so with that in mind, I am excited about where Marathon <em>could</em> go.</p><p>But there's also a graveyard filled with short-lived games-as-a-service titles that failed to capture the attention of an already-committed audience. And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/">lately</a> big-budget titles from well-funded, high-profile teams have unfortunately made it there too. Like it or not, there are certain things that players already have and expect from similar titles, if they are to find a place in their gaming lives. In a world of free-to-play titles, a full-priced game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie.</p>

<p>The team at Bungie has sat down in front of a live crowd to carry out one of the most exciting reveals in recent years – <strong>Marathon gameplay</strong>. This game is a reboot of a title that dropped in the 1990s, but it’s coming back to the market in an entirely different format: an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Bungie has put a lot of stock into Marathon; that much is certain. The extended showcase that revealed Marathon gameplay was a big-budget affair in a full-fledged studio packed with Bungie employees and guests.</p>



<p>And it makes sense because Marathon looks fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>The gameplay trailer for Marathon was stunning, showcasing how the core gameplay mechanics will work. This is a much more manageable extraction shooter that uses arcade elements. There are on-screen prompts, a helpful UI and HUD, and contextual pings sitting front and centre.</p>



<p>‘Death is not the end’ is the running theme in this game, and Bungie has designed Marathon to be a flawless team-based shooter.</p>



<p>It’s all about adapting to ever-evolving games that never go the same way twice. </p>



<p>You can see what I’m talking about in the extended gameplay trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There’s so much to soak up in the extended gameplay trailer. We get a look at some of the maps and Runners, which are the cybernetic characters that players will control in Marathon. We’re seeing invisibility upgrades, energy shields, scanners, and many other augments. There are traversal and movement mechanics that keep things fluid, but it all depends on your Runner.</p>



<p>The team stressed that the gameplay loop will feature ‘costs’. No one Runner is without a weakness. For example, if one character can overdrive and move faster, they’ll overheat, and it will impact them in another way.</p>

I won't lie, sometimes when I hear a string of words like "beautiful hand-drawn Metroidvania with challenging combat etc., etc.," my eyes do start to glaze over a bit. It can be a bit buzzwordy! But, gosh, that there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-eternal-life-of-goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> looks a bit stunning doesn't it? It was shown off last month during Nintendo's Not Switch 2 Direct, but earlier this week it received another trailer offering another look, and more importantly, who'll be composing it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There'll actually be a few people making music for the game, though the trailer is geared around Yasunori Nishiki, whose work you'll have most recently heard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth through a few arrangements. He's worked on a few other Square Enix games too, like helping out on Final Fantasy 7 Remake and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, and he's the lead composer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series. I've not played any of them but I have heard a few tracks from them and they all have quite lovely scores, so Nishiki seems like a pretty damn good get.

He'll also be joined by the likes of Kevin Penkin (Florence, Star Wars: Visions), Mason Lieberman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a>), and Pete Lepley (Wargroove, Sky Rogue). The new trailer is quite cute, as it's framed as Nishiki not having started working on any music yet, with the other three composers giving him some friendly, perhaps contrasting advice.
</p>
<p>
The music that has been made so far is sounding good too. I'm really quite fond of how the game has an elderly protagonist too, despite being an action-focused game. Love it when a game knows anyone can be the hero!
</p>
<p>
Currently The Eternal Life of Goldman doesn't have a release date, but you could always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>Bungie has revealed that Marathon, an ambitious first-person extraction shooter, will be released on September 23, with a closed alpha coming soon. This information was revealed today during a live showcase hosted by the game’s developers.</p>



<p>In case you’ve been left out of the loop, Marathon is an ambitious extraction shooter that has serious sci-fi vibes. It’s colourful, innovative, and exciting, and it has been described as accessible and more social than your average extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Read on to find out more about the Marathon release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>Marathon stands out immediately from the opening trailer that revealed the game’s release date. The palette pops on the screen, and everything from the class systems to the in-game abilities are exciting and punchy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full reveal trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZRGDZCl9pg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>An extraction shooter isn’t necessarily what we expected from Bungie, the team best known for Halo and Destiny, but we’re here for it. It’s a reimagination of one of the toughest genres in gaming, with the team having created a never-before-seen vibe that still retains that core gameplay loop that you’d expect from an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is effectively a reboot of a game that surfaced in 1994 – but it wasn’t an extraction shooter, of course. This is a total pivot that ‘does justice’ to the original title and ‘pays homage’ to the game’s creator.</p>



<p>This is a team-based extraction shooter that features cybernetic characters tactical of ‘tactical and fast-paced combat’. It will be released with several maps that players can explore at will, battling ‘worldly threats’, AI enemies, and other players. It’s all about looting, completing quests, and getting out again without succumbing.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think in the comments, or check out the community on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is about to become an even better-looking game with the NaturalVision Enhanced mod, which promises to bring the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>The new version of the popular mood now available for the original version of the game has been showcased this week with some brand new screenshots that highlight the stunning visual improvements it will bring. In addition to the brand new improvements, the developer behind the mod, Razed, confirmed on <a href="https://discord.gg/gtav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> that they have been able to enable an unused feature in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition which casts additional shadows from all light resources, resulting in more depth and detail in the vast majority of scenarios, as highlighted in some <a href="https://content.razedmods.com/enhanced">comparison screenshots</a>. A release date for the mod, which will be launched for free, has yet to be confirmed, but a trailer is already in the works, so it shouldn't be long until we see more of this mod in actual action.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is, without a doubt, the best way to experience the fifth entry in the series ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI release later this year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. In addition to providing a great experience that looks better than ever, the new version of the game is likely also a<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/"> preview of some of the tech</a> players should expect to see in the upcoming new entry in the series, although it will be only until the PC version until the game's gorgeous visuals will run at anything beyond 30 FPS if how the Enhanced Edition runs on CPUs on par with those powering current generation consoles is of any indication.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about this version of the game in Alessio's<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/"> analysis.</a></p>

            <p>
The time is almost upon us all to prepare for the end of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and by end, I mean the RPG's final big update. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/larian-studios">Larian</a> cheekily shared last year that it'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors">one final hurrah</a> in spite of the fact they'd said that patch 7 would be the last major one. Now, in a quick little video posted to the official Larian YouTube channel yesterday, the developer confirmed that patch 8 will be dropping April 15th next week. There's even a special little livestream coming April 16th, 9am EST/ 2pm BST where senior systems designer Ross Stephens will be chatting about the game, alongside a look at the new patch.
</p>

<p>
It's also quite a doozy of an update! For starters, there's cross-play coming with this one meaning you'll be able to play with, well, anybody. There's also a photo mode coming with this game, something that'll really elevate Baldur's Gate 3 to the 2000s era dress-up game it deserves to be. Looks pretty in-depth too, lots of settings to fiddle around with, lots of ways to make your party members look even hunkier.

<p>
The biggest addition to the game is definitely all the new subclasses. There's one for each of the main classes, all of which come with new abilities, summons, cantrips, that sort of thing. Clerics will have access to the Death Domain subclass, for example, which comes with some new necromancy cantrips and spells. 
</p>
<p>
I quite like the look of the Wizard's Bladesinging subclass, which lets you use a sword to cast your spells, plus an ability that gives you "supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make."
</p>
<p>
Larian have said that there might be a few smaller updates to come, but in the meantime they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">cooking up something new</a>, whatever that is.

<p>The playlist features 45 tracks, the synth score "providing the perfect backdrop to Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures with unique tracks ranging from atmospheric to high tension".</p>
<p>"Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music," Grefberg explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/spilt-fiction-official-soundtrack-out-now">Q&amp;A</a> about the game's music.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the inspiration comes from common genres like trance or drum and bass or cinematic new age music. Other times the inspiration originated from a single instrument. For example, the traversal music throughout most of Summit is based on our own live recordings of hangdrums. There are a few subtle references in there, but most inspiration is based on the foundations of genres or instruments taken in our own unique direction."</p>
<p>Grefberg explained that to create the dynamic score that jumps between different genres, the composers "sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress".</p>
<p>"We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed."</p>
<p>Split Fiction shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Guinness World Records revealed Hazelight's part-fantasy, part-sci-fi adventure "broke an impressive three world records within days of its release", becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[New Prototype Game In The Works, Playtester Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-prototype-game-in-the-works-playtester-claims/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-prototype-game-in-the-works-playtester-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Prototype game is reportedly in development. According to a user on reddit by the name of Bigbyy, they were given details about a new game in the series as part of a recent study group session.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user claims</a> that the game will see Alex Mercer return as its protagonist. Gameplay will reportedly feature shapeshifting and transforming into other people in order “to infiltrate areas”. Lastly, it will be based in New York City.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Bigbyy regarding these claims, and was told the following:</p>



<p>“[It] was YouGov survey which asked me to sign an NDA and confirm that I would not disclose the contents,” they said. “It then confirmed a series of features that upcoming games will include and how popular this was with me [percentage wise]. It was not a playtest but did specify that these features were already planned as part of upcoming games.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has yet to fully verify the validity of the claims, but felt it was a rumor worth covering. As always, until it’s verified by Insider Gaming with more details or officially announced by Activision, take all of the information with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>The Prototype series hasn’t seen a new game release since 2012’s Prototype 2. That game was also ported to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2015, but there has been any news surrounding the series since. After Prototype 2’s initial launch, Activision say that the game “did not find a broad commercial audience” leading to layoffs at its developer Radical Entertainment.</p>



<p>In addition to claims of a new Prototype game, the same person revealed some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details planned for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Per his claims, the game will feature a co-op story mode with up to four players, updated omni movement, changes to Zombies, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another Call of Duty playtester has given more details on what you expect with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of Bigbyy on Reddit, who claims that he was a part of a recent Call of Duty study group. Allegedly </p>



<p>Most of the details have already been reported on by Insider Gaming in some capacity, including that the game is a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2 sequel</a>&nbsp;and that the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original zombies crew is likely making a return</a>. We’ve also previously reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 has already got all of its six round-based zombies</a> planned and figured out. </p>



<p>That being said, the playtester has given some further details on what to expect, and the information lines up with what Insider Gaming has heard but has yet to report on. Caution, spoilers ahead – It should also be stressed that this is a <strong>study group</strong> and is a means to gauge interest and feedback, meaning some features might not make it into the final game.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-details-leaked">Black Ops 7 Details Leaked</h2>



<p>According to to the playtester, this is what to expect in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<ul>
<li>The story will focus on 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black ops 2 story. Story will also involve Woods and Mason.</li>



<li>Story mode will allow for up to 4 player co-op</li>



<li>Story will also include a big open world map titled “Avalon”</li>



<li>Omni movement will return and include wall running.</li>



<li>Zombies mode will have the original crew return as mulitiverse variations (Dempsey etc)</li>



<li>Zombies mode will have a Tranzit remake</li>



<li>Zombies will be round based</li>



<li>Zombies mode will also have a difficulty toggle, a “wonder vehicle” and a more story focused role as well</li>



<li>Zombies mode will feature the largest round based map ever created (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more details by Insider Gaming here</a>)</li>



<li>Multiplayer will feature a 32vs32 player mode</li>



<li>Will feature some remakes of popular maps in a 2035 futuristic Japanese style theme</li>



<li>Plan for everything to have a progression level system, including grenades, killstreaks and perks</li>



<li>Plans for multiplayer progression to carry over from Black Ops 6</li>
</ul>



<p>To me, and again, a lot of what’s been said here lines up with what we have already reported and what I have heard, but the last thing that the user claims it a little bit of a headscratcher and a curveball.</p>



<p>According to the user, he said got a glimpse of some kind of view of another Prototype game, where he said, ”&nbsp;I also saw that another Prototype is planned with Alex Mercer returning as the protagonist. Gameplay will involve shapeshifting, transforming into other people to infiltrate areas and the game will be set in New York.”</p>



<p>Of course, it’s entirely possible if the majority of the Call of Duty information comes to fruition, but nonetheless, it’s a tad weird to have another game as a part of a study group! </p>



<p>I’ve reached out to the user for verification of his claims and should I receive them, I will update the article. </p>
