<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is in the midst of its one-year anniversary celebrations, and a new set is right around the corner in Mega Rising, for which we have all the release date and start time details.</p>



<p>New sets in Pokémon TCG Pocket have been a regular occurrence since the title first released, but Mega Rising is a big moment for the title as it introduces the mechanic of Mega Evolution, adding further complexity to deck building to consider.</p>



<p>For all the release details of the Mega Rising set, check out our guide below.</p>

<p><strong>TCG Pocket’s B1 Mega Rising set will be released on Thursday, October 30, as confirmed by the trailer for the new set.</strong></p>



<p>The launch of the set marks the start of the second year of Pokémon TCG Pocket with the start of ‘B’ sets, though it’s not clear at this stage exactly how that will shake up the meta and what restrictions, if any, will be in place for cards.</p>



<p>There’s still time to get your hands on Pack Hourglasses ahead of the release of the set, and it’s worth taking every opportunity you can ahead of the release.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1-mega-rising-start-times">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The B1 Mega Rising set will be available in the game from 11 PM PT on October 29, with a release on October 30 for the majority of the world.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows the exact release time and date for major time zones across the world.</p>

<p><strong>The Mega Rising set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong> <strong>is headlined by the introduction of Mega Evolutions, following the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Mega Evolutions returning in the physical TCG.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of release, the full set list has been <a href="https://www.serebii.net/tcgpocket/megarising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed by Serebii</a>, featuring Mega Pinsir, Mega Blaziken, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Altaria amongst the cards. In total, there are 331 cards in the set—broken down into 226 normal cards and 105 Secret Rares.</p>



<p>The set will be split into three booster packs, like Genetic Apex was in the initial release of the game.</p>

<p>The release will boast the full game alongside key expansions and improvements, plus full cooperative play via online connection. If that's not enough, Repentance+ will also benefit from a full physical release, so no Game-Key Card here, folks.</p>

<p>Pre-orders are available now via the <a href="https://store.nicalis.com/products/repplus?variant=46804993999105">official Nicalis store</a>, though we'll be honest, we felt a bit of minor bit of whiplash at the <strong>£54</strong> asking price. It's not horrendous, but it's also not what we'd call 'affordable'.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Online play in all game modes, including daily runs, Greed mode, and challenges.<br>
- Extensive preference filters when hosting or searching for online matches.<br>
- Emote wheel and voice chat for online communication.<br>
- New “Item Descriptions” option reveals the full functionality of items you’ve previously collected.<br>
- New leaderboards for online play.<br>
- Over 700 different items to collect.<br>
- More than 300 enemy types and bosses.<br>
- Multiple difficulty settings, game modes, branching paths and endings to discover.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chances are this one will almost certainly be available digitally, so we'll be sure to provide more updates, including its price, as soon as we can.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-gets-killed-off-by-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning-to-it.1337935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It was practically a given following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the mass layoffs at Amazon Game Studios</a>, but we now have confirmation that New World, the MMORPG developed by the team based in Irvine, California, is effectively on life support.</p>



<p>Amazon has clarified that Season 10: Nighthaven, which launched earlier this month, will be the last content update because further development 'is not sustainable'. The servers are, however, guaranteed to remain up throughout December 31, 2026 at the least. Complete closure of the servers will likely follow shortly after that date, although Amazon said it will notify players at least six months before that happens.</p>



<p>For now, the game and its in-game currency remain purchasable on all platforms, and New World also remains playable on PlayStation 5 for PlayStation Plus subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers. Again, when that changes, Amazon will send a notice.</p>



<p>The MMORPG was the first big project financed by Amazon as part of its gaming initiative. <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-reveals-breakaway-new-world-crucible-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was originally revealed at TwitchCon 2016</a> alongside the MOBA Breakway and the third-person shooter game Crucible, which however were canceled before or shortly after their launch.</p>



<p>New World, on the other hand, kept going, albeit with a few delays. The original vision was for a sandbox-style PvP focused MMORPG, but the team pivoted to a more traditional PvE game with dungeons and story missions while still retained some PvP elements from the previous design.</p>



<p>As someone who followed the game throughout its entire development and then spent a couple of hundred hours playing it, I can say that this confusing design was among the game's biggest failures. While a lot of people were hyped for its release in September 2021 as the first Western-made AAA MMORPG to launch since 2014's The Elder Scrolls Online, leading to a strong debut that <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even Jeff Bezos praising the team</a>, it became immediately clear that there wasn't nearly enough PvE content to keep PvE players interested. On the other hand, the PvP limitations (optional flagging, no looting, etc.) that were introduced to cater to those PvE players ensured that even the PvP niche was not satisfied.</p>



<p>The game could only keep me and my guild interested for two months before boredom inevitably set in. Overall, players left in droves. To their credit, the developers started working on more PvE content, as evidenced by the following updates, the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year's Aeternum rebrand and console launch</a>.</p>



<p>However, it was simply not enough to turn the tide. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final attempt with Season 10: Nighthaven</a> actually caught the interest of MMO fans, allowing the game to rebound and bringing back long server queues, but it was probably too little, too late at that point, as Amazon had already decided to close down the project.</p>



<p>So far, Amazon has not clarified what will happen to The Lord of the Rings MMO project, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revived two years ago</a>. It is most likely dead, too, but we have asked for an official statement on the matter.</p>

<p>These layoffs were initially reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">Bloomberg</a>. Amazon haven't confirmed exactly how many staff in its video game arm have been affected by the layoffs, though New World developers Amazon Games Orange County have seen "significant" cuts.</p>
<p>What has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/amazon-games-layoffs-halt-aaa-development-1236563508/">been made 100% clear</a> by Amazon vice president of audio, Twitch and games Steve Boom is that these layoffs are seeing the company move away from heavy investment into MMOs, with recently re-launched cloud service Amazon Luna being doubled down on. The company will plough on with some of the other games it's got in the works or is publishing, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">a new Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics</a>, strategy game March of the Giants, and an unannounced racer from Maverick Games.</p>
<p>That brings us to New World and a <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">news post</a> published by Amazon Games late yesterday. "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," it reads. "The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles."</p><p>While it won't be getting any more additions alongside essential bug fixes, the MMO won't disappear overnight. Amazon Games plan to keep its servers running "through 2026" and say they'll provide at least six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable. In the meantime, New World's Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are being dished out for free on PC. You can also still buy and use in-game currency like Marks of Fortune for the moment, but no refunds'll be offered on any you've already bought.</p>
<p>"Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey," the post concludes. "We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by Amazon's mass layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If I try to think of brands that appeal to everyone across all ages and gender, the one that pops into my mind front and center has got to be LEGO. Whether you’re a kid or just a kid at heart, there is joy to be found in building a LEGO set. Assembling LEGO bricks piece by piece, can be a mindful, rewarding, and enjoyable activity. Then by the send of it, you have some cool <em>Star Wars</em> or <em>Marvel</em> toy to play with or display on your shelf.</p>
<p>The only catch is that LEGO sets can get pretty pricey, and when they do actually go on sale, it’s usually not by a lot or it sells out almost immediately. That’s what when a big sale does kick in, it’s hard to pass it up. Right now, this LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano set depicting the duel on Peridea has dropped in price:&nbsp;With the 40% off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/">you end up saving $22 as the price comes down to just $33 (down from $55) for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>From the <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em> Season 1 Finale</h2>
<p>There are too many Star Wars LEGO sets to count, and even a small handful depicting scenes from the recent Disney Plus show <em>Star Wars: Ahsoka</em>. This set portrays <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s duel on Peridea against Grand Admiral Thrawn’s army</strong> from the final episode of the show’s first season.</p>



<p>The <strong>382-piece set designed for ages eight and up</strong> includes five minifigures of characters from the show: We have <strong>Ahsoka Tano, Grand Admiral Thrawn, Morgan Elsbeth, Ezra Bridger and a Night Trooper</strong>. The buildable brick platform they fight on features three built-in turntables which can spin each minifigure allowing you to recreate their dynamic battle. You can even reenact Ezra’s leap off the platform with the launchpad.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p>Right now, the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s Duel on Peridea is discounted down to its lowest price yet of just $33.</p>

Neither Microsoft nor Asus would admit there’s a problem with the white Xbox Ally or offer a timeline to fix it after repeated requests by <em>The Verge</em>. (Asus tells me it needs more time to test.)</p><p>But if you want your white Asus handheld to start working reliably, you <em>could</em> do what I did: I installed the latest build <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">of Bazzite</a>, a SteamOS-like, Linux-based operating system that works properly with gamepad controls, and sleeps like a dream. I didn’t need to hibernate or shut down once this past weekend as I blazed through hours of <em>Silksong</em> and finally triumphed in a tough boss fight.</p><p>Did I mention Bazzite runs most of my Windows games <em>substantially faster </em>than Windows?</p><div><h2>Bazzite vs. Windows vs. Deck OLED</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Bazzite)</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally (Win 11)</h3></th><th><h3>Bazzite vs. Windows</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X (Z2E)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>48</td><td>39</td><td>23.08%</td><td>50</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>53</td><td>41</td><td>29.27%</td><td></td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>54</td><td>43</td><td>25.58%</td><td>50</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>55</td><td>21.82%</td><td>64</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td></td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>72</td><td>58</td><td>24.14%</td><td>64</td><td>106</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>20</td><td>24</td><td>-16.67%</td><td>25</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td></td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>21</td><td>26</td><td>-19.23%</td><td>25</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>59</td><td>51</td><td>15.69%</td><td>60</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>63</td><td>55</td><td>14.55%</td><td></td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>64</td><td>55</td><td>16.36%</td><td>60</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>33</td><td>26</td><td>26.92%</td><td>34</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>36</td><td>27</td><td>33.33%</td><td>34</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates at 720p low, save </em>Cyberpunk 2077 <em>at 720p Steam Deck preset.

With Bazzite, the same device runs up to 30 percent faster than with Windows, and beats the Steam Deck in all but one of my gaming benchmarks.</p><p>It’s not just games that feel faster: Steam is a far more responsive interface without the bloat of Windows lurking under the hood. It feels like an entirely different handheld. With Bazzite, I can use it like I use a Nintendo Switch, simply pressing the power button whenever I want to pause a game, then picking up exactly where I left off hours or days later.</p><p>It’s faster to launch games, faster to wake from sleep; I also almost never need to touch the screen and leave fingerprints, something that still eludes Microsoft’s latest attempt at gamepad-controlled Windows.</p><div id=":R4ibcrij96:"><div><p><figcaption>Even the Ally’s buttons are less confusing under Bazzite.

(Yes, I’m on the unstable build, since that’s the version that fixed sleep first.)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I won’t get into all the details because I don’t want to sound like a broken record — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">last December, I already wrote how Bazzite turned the previous ROG Ally X</a> (not to be confused with the Xbox Ally X) into the best handheld of 2024. And once again, I’ll admit I see no battery life advantage for Bazzite over Windows — occasionally, I even see Bazzite draining a watt more than Microsoft’s OS.</p><p>But it is <em>such a repudiation of Windows</em> that Microsoft’s first “Xbox” handheld, the one with a version of Windows that was supposed to reduce the bloat and fix performance and sleep modes, built by a multi-trillion dollar company, is so effortlessly beaten by the efforts of a few Linux programmers standing atop the shoulders of the roughly 300-person Valve and the broader Linux community.</p><p>Bazzite had a problem getting the white Xbox Ally to sleep too, at first. When I installed it on October 19th, pressing the power button put the system into a state where it wouldn’t wake up again; I needed to hard-reset every time. But that’s because Bazzite’s developers <em>didn’t </em>yet have an Xbox Ally. Two days after programmer Antheas Kapenekakis obtained the hardware and consulted with two contacts at AMD, the three fixed it — and got the Xbox Ally’s programable RGB joystick lights working in Linux, too.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Bazzite and its built-in Handheld Companion let you control the Ally’s TDP, buttons, and lighting with just a couple presses.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>To give you some idea of just how unreliable the vanilla Xbox Ally is right now, I tested two of them last week, one with “Modern Standby Assist” and “Extreme Standby” turned on, the other off. I applied every update available, checked their batteries regularly, and monitored whenever they woke up.</p><p>Both repeatedly woke up all by themselves at seemingly random intervals, just sitting on my desk, then usually put themselves back to sleep. The deeper sleeper lost 10 percent of its battery life after 12 hours, the other lost 23 percent. (The latter needed to be woken up twice in a row for the gamepad to continue working.)</p><p>But after another 12 hours, I found both handhelds only had 30 percent battery remaining. I’m not sure what happened to one, but the other had clearly tried to apply a Windows Update when it should have been asleep. Separately, I also saw both Windows units refuse to wake from sleep, requiring a hard reset before they would come back to life again. Some Redditors have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obltnp/anyone_else_having_these_issues/">also reported</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1obka7w/xbox_ally_x_sleepwake_help/">that issue</a> with both versions of the Xbox Ally, as well as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxAlly/comments/1oamybz/battery_drain_overnight/">surprise battery drain</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Even though it’s so much better with Bazzite, I hope Microsoft fixes Windows soon.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Microsoft declined our request for an interview about the future of the Xbox Ally or a timeline on fixes, but VP of Windows product management Anshul Rawat provided this statement to <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Windows and Xbox teams are aware of the challenges a limited number of players have experienced and are actively working to refine sleep and wake reliability. We’ve identified a small set of issues and initial fixes will be rolling out soon. Optimizing Windows, the most flexible OS in the world, for a range of devices and screen sizes across PCs and the cloud is an ongoing journey. As we work with our partners to provide a great experience on gaming handhelds, community feedback plays an important role in shaping these improvements for all players.</p></blockquote></div><p>We’ve asked Microsoft what it means by “limited number of players” and “rolling out soon.”</p><p>If I had bought an Xbox Ally myself, I’m not sure I’d wait for Microsoft to figure it out. At a minimum, I <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/">would dual-boot</a>, occasionally swapping back to Windows to get new BIOS updates.</p><p>There are many lingering misconceptions about Linux gaming, like how it supposedly provides less choice than Windows, doesn’t offer game stores other than Steam, doesn’t play as many games, runs those games poorly by comparison. With some exceptions — mostly games with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">advanced anti-cheat solutions</a> — they’re not true.</p><p>You can sideload games from the Epic Games Store, from Battle.net, from Ubisoft and GOG and more, and the Linux community’s efforts mean many aging PC games that have issues running on Windows run fine on Linux. <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> helps you check if your favs are among them.</p><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I imagine the biggest question people who've put hundreds or thousands of hours into Amazon's MMO New World have right now is: are all my efforts about to be wiped? Is the game about to go offline, and close?</p>
<p>The concern, remember, comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">a report aired yesterday that Amazon is gutting its games business</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon has now addressed these questions and the top-line takeaway is ongoing New World development will cease. The game is in trouble. But will it close? The answer to that is hazier.</p>
<p>As it stands, Amazon won't guarantee the game's life beyond 2026, but it has promised to give you six months notice before turning anything off. Here are the pertinent questions and answers from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">the New World website</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Are you sunsetting the game?</em></p>
<p><em>"No, not at this time. While New World will not be receiving new content updates, servers will be live through 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>"How long will I be able to play New World: Aeternum?</em></p>
<p><em>"We will provide more details on what to expect in the coming months. We will provide a minimum of six months' notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World: Aeternum."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding ongoing development: there simply won't be any. Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update will be the last updates released for the game, and by way of thanking you for your support over the years, they will be made free. The Rise of the Angry Earth update will also be made free but only for PC players. Holiday events in the game will also cease.</p><p>"After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates," wrote the New World team by way of an explanation.</p>
<p>"In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.</p>
<p>"We're deeply grateful for every moment you've spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special."</p>
<p>New World launched in 2021 and, for a while, caused a stir. Its blend of faction versus faction PvP warfare, territorial warring, and skill-focused gameplay made it popular. But it has since fallen out of relevance, landing us, presumably, where we are now.</p><p>The game's potential server-closures stand in stark contrast to the fleet of decades-old MMOs that rumble on elsewhere in the industry, both colossal ones like World of Warcraft and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, and smaller ones such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/everquest-ii">EverQuest 2</a>. They are the sorts of games you make considerable time investments in, living as you do in their virtual worlds, and I imagine the prospect of losing all of that investment now is a very harsh - and disappointing and trust breaking - reality to face.</p>

<p>Live on Kickstarter now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rune_factory_4">Rune Factory 4</a> director Shinichi Manabe is currently hard at work creating a new farming sim alongside writer Takanori Tsuji, and it's now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1005170304/farnia-village/description">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Farnia Village</strong> is currently eyeing a release on Steam, but Manabe-san also states that a console release may be on the cards at some point in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game is being optimized to run comfortably on hardware comparable to the Nintendo Switch, which means it should perform well on most laptops. Looking ahead, we hope to bring the game to home consoles in the future, if possible."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The big hook (if you can really call it that) for Farnia Village is that you can continue living in its world long after you've completed the main quest. You'll be tending to your crops, looking after animals, forging relationships with the local residents, and more. In short, it's a farming sim through and through.</p>
<p>As for the release date, well... it sounds like it's quite a ways off, at the moment. The earliest delivery date listed in the pledges is 'September 2027', but some of them even state 'September 2028', so who knows. We won't be seeing this one for a while yet, and it's possible a console release could be even further out.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter is creeping toward its ¥5,000,000 goal (roughly £24,845) with another 29 days to go. Stretch goals include extra characters more dungeons and crops, and additional music tracks. If this all sounds good to you, then consider checking out the full campaign when you have a moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Remedy Entertainment published <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its Q3 2025 financial report</a>. As expected, it's not great news for the Finnish studio. Tero Virtala, the company's CEO for nine years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">stepped do</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/">n earlier this month</a> after Remedy told investors that the game FBC: Firebreak had effectively failed.</p>



<p>This past quarter, just as the studio celebrated the thirty years since its foundation, the financial highlights were indeed very negative:</p>



<ul>
<li>Revenue decreased by -32.0% to € 12.2 (17.9) million.</li>



<li>EBITDA was € 0.7 (6.6) million.</li>



<li>Operating profit (EBIT) was € -16.4 (2.4) million, and the operating profit margin was -135.1% (13.4%) of revenue.</li>



<li>Cash flow from operations was € 11.3 (8.0) million.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, interim CEO Markus Mäki reassured investors (and fans) that the remaining projects are on track, and the studio is still confident in its ability to achieve 'significant commercial success' by 2030.</p>



<p><em>Despite challenges with FBC: Firebreak, our other in-development projects are progressing according to plan. The majority of our effort goes into working with our established franchises – Control and Alan Wake – which we continue to invest in and expand into other media as part of our long-term strategy. In addition, we’re focused on the Max Payne 1&amp;2 remake with Rockstar Games. While carefully balancing our product risk, we also need to retain the ability to create new experiences for our audiences, as we have for the past 30 years. We aren’t satisfied with our recent financial performance, but we remain confident in our ability to create great video games that resonate with players and which are commercially successful, leading us back to profitability.</em></p>



<p>Remedy has set for itself the following financial targets:</p>



<ul>
<li>To reach a revenue two times higher than last year's by 2027 and then maintain continued growth beyond this milestone.</li>



<li>To achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 30% by 2027 and keep it afterward. </li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control 2</a> and the Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes are still in full production, and there's also a new project in the proof of concept phase. Given that the studio is focused on growing its two franchises, Control and Alan Wake, which are part of the same 'Remedy Connected Universe', the new project is likely also set in one of them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With its many accessibility options, Ninja Gaiden 4 is one of the most approachable entries in the series, allowing players to experience its high-speed action without letting the high challenge level get in the way of enjoyment.</p>



<p> Those who want to truly appreciate the game, however, will wish to master many of its intricacies, put their skills to the test, and attempt to achieve an S rank for completing each of the story chapters.</p>



<p>Here are some tips to help you understand the mission scoring system and what you should always strive to do to achieve such a high rank.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: Tips and strategies tested in S rank mission completions at Normal and Hard difficulty over a total of 40+ hours in the game's Steam 1.0.1.0 version. Screenshots captured from the same version.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-achieve-a-guaranteed-s-rank-in-ninja-gaiden-4">How To Achieve A Guaranteed S Rank in Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Your total completion rank for any mission in Ninja Gaiden, whether in Story Mode or Chapter Select mode, is decided by the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">total Karma score</strong>. Once it exceeds certain thresholds, the rank increases, up to the Master Ninja S Rank. This score depends on the obtained Technique Points, the total number of kills, Clear Time, and the Items Used and Deaths multipliers. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">These two multipliers are key to achieving a guaranteed S rank in all missions, regardless of difficulty.</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Imperfect-Run-S-Rank-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>A No Item Run of any Mission makes it possible to achieve S rank even if you don't take down every enemy in a mission</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Specifically, completing any Mission without using any item and without dying grants <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a 1.2x multiplier</strong> for your Karma score, which ensures even a lower Technique, Kills, and Clear Time score can surpass the threshold to achieve the highest rank, as you can see in my imperfect Mission 03 Normal Mode run above. Dying even once, however, will reduce your total Karma score with a negative multiplier, making it impossible to achieve S rank, so it should be avoided at all costs in S rank runs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">While achieving a No Item, No Death run of any Mission can be a challenge even at Normal difficulty, you can abuse the game's checkpoint system to avoid repeating runs from the beginning. Whenever your health gets into Critical Condition, as signaled by the visual noise on screen, open the menu and pick the Restart from Checkpoint option before you are defeated. This will bring warp you back to the nearest Terminal or Muramasa statue, with no penalty whatsoever. This is a classic PlatinumGames trick that works great in Ninja Gaiden 4</em> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">as well.</em></strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: The above trick has yet to be tested in Master Ninja mode, as its very high difficulty makes it challenging to even just complete a mission, let alone go for an S rank. Considering how this trick worked in almost every other action game developed by PlatinumGames at the highest difficulty, it should work just as well at Master Ninja mode. The guide will be updated with the confirmation once thorough testing has been conducted</strong></em>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> arrives in full today, October 29th. Ahead of the gates to Arcadia finally being flung open to those who didn't fancy paying extra for early access, Obsidian have taken a stab at fixing some key issues and pesky bugs which've reared their heads so far. Good news, unless your roleplaying was set to be contingent upon being swallowed up by the ground or having to try and beat up an angry cupboard at some point in the space adventure.</p>

<p>Taking a look through the notes of <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-hotfix-1040">hotfix 1.0.4.0</a>, I've spotted a couple of minor hiccups I ran into during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">my review playthrough</a>, these being Aza the culty companion regularly indicating a need to chat when there was no fresh convo to be had and Golden Ridge's Monastery sometimes being a bit confusing to navigate despite the objective markers' best efforts.</p>
<p>Some more critical bugs swatted include a "permanent fade to black" which could seemingly see the game unintentionally declare 'that's all folks' when you returned to a certain landing pad, the acidic body dematerializer stopping you from equipping weapons if you saved while using it, and companion Inez sometimes being tough to find after her first encounter. Obsidian say they've also "improved the accuracy of information displayed during the end-of-game slides".</p>
<p>Beyond those, there are plenty of more generic bugs you might get early in a game's lifespan, such as certain actions leading the player to fall through the world, quests not progressing, placeholder text popping up, and some collision misbehaviour. Amusingly, the studio add that "the game will no longer crash when interrupting certain NPC bark dialogue lines by interacting with or killing one of the participating speakers" and that you'll no longer run into in issue which would lead you to be be stuck in perma-combat because an enemy was trapped in a closet.</p><p>Finally, I've reached out to Obsidian for clarification regarding the very first bug the post lists. You see, it says PS5 players have run into issues with premium edition gear not being handed out properly, and underneath there's a note which reads as follows: "Unfortunately, the Consumerism Flaw being rewarded is not fixed in this patch and will be addressed in a future hotfix". Since I'm not 100% sure at a glance whether that's PS5 specific like the gear issues, I've opted to double check in case my running into that flaw when I did on PC was related to some bugginess, rather than the gag myself and others have since assumed it to be.</p>
<p>If word comes through that it's just a bug after all, I'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/so-it-turns-out-the-outer-worlds-2-spent-95-of-its-runtime-mocking-me-for-a-purchase-i-didnt-make">update this piece</a> and don the Moon Man helmet of shame.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund isn't worried about Arc Raiders releasing between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to">In an interview with Christopher Dring at The Game Business</a>, the former EA studio lead talked about the studio, The Finals' journey to profitability, and Embarks' approach to live service development. On the specific subject of Arc Raiders release date, Soderlund stated:</p>
<p>"People may look at that and say, 'what the hell are they doing?' We have spent a lot of time looking at this from multiple angles and you know, for right or wrong, we believe that the game can launch there. This is the start of a long journey. It needs to start somewhere."</p>

<p>Despite Arc Raiders' seemingly uncomfortable launch date, the game has garnered a substantial amount of positive attention from players. When asked how, Soderlund responded with the following: "I think it comes down to not being complacent enough to believe that we can build something without making a meaningful impact or innovation. We have to bring something so that people pay attention. And if we've done a good enough job, maybe they'll stick around. But in order for them to break away from what they're already playing, there needs to be an attraction."</p><p>This is just a small portion of an almost 50-minute interview, which is well worth listening to in full. But Arc Raiders' situation does harken back to an all-too familiar situation for Soderlund and many Embark Studios' initial staff. Soderlund was the executive vice president of EA when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> launched, itself squeezed between a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Arc Raiders can sustain its momentum while caught in a similar predicament remains to be seen, though perhaps an extra decade of experience, an intense feeling of virality around Arc Raiders, and a vastly different industry landscape can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders is set to release tomorrow on PC and consoles.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/new-world-aeternum-season-10-will-be-the-last-content-update-for-amazons-mmorpg/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With news of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m3zm9jnl1o">massive layoffs coming to parts of Amazon’s corporate business</a>, the company has also turned its baleful gaze towards its gaming division and announced that their MMORPG New World will no longer receive content updates after the recently released Season 10: Nighthaven content has run its course.</p>
<p>This isn’t an end of service notice just yet, with the companion FAQ stating that servers will be live through 2026 at least, and they will provide at least six months’ notice of a server shutdown. Because of that, and with the Nighthaven seasonal content still planned to roll out gradually, the New World is remaining on sale and part of the PS Plus library, and microtransaction currency will still be available, though the appeal of the game and player base will no doubt dwindle through the coming months.</p>


<p>We also await news of Amazon Game Studios’ future with dread….</p>
<p>New World arrived with a huge bang in 2021, as Amazon brought its fantasy colonialist MMORPG to PC, racing to a huge peak of over 900,000 concurrent players that pushed the servers beyond the limit. After such a strong start, the playerbase (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>) dwindled through early 2022, but enjoyed a new peak of over 130,000 for the first yearly expansion. Perhaps a lot of expectation was put internally on the potential of the console port, which arrived with a major game overhaul last September in the form of New World: Aeternum, but on PC at least, the game has spent much of this year with daily peak player counts below 10,000, jumping up to 50,000 with the new Nighthaven update. That’s roughly comparable with a Fallout 76 or Elder Scrolls: Online, so could easily have been sustainable depending on development expenditure, but it’s half of where Destiny 2 commonly is right now, and that game is widely regarded as being in serious trouble.</p>
<p>The announcement reads:</p>

<p><em>As New World recognizes its fourth anniversary since launching on PC, we reflect on an incredible journey shaped by our dedicated player community. Your feedback and passion have been instrumental in evolving Aeternum into the world it is today, and our team is deeply grateful for this shared adventure. After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.</em></p>
<p><em>The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for New World on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision. To thank you, the New World community, for your support over the years, we have made the Nighthaven release available to you for free. To ensure all New World players can experience this content, we also made Rise of the Angry Earth free for all PC players.</em></p>
<p><em>In the coming months, we will provide more details on what to expect and other essential information. Rest assured, our intention is to keep servers operating through 2026, allowing our community time to continue their adventures in Aeternum. Additionally, New World: Aeternum will still be downloadable for PlayStation Plus members (Extra and Premium).</em></p>
<p><em>Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this New World adventure an unforgettable journey. We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you, thank you for helping make this game something truly special.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-romero-says-he%E2%80%99s-talking-with-many-companies-to-finish-the-game-that-was-being-funded-by-microsoft.1337854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>John Romero might not be a name that youngsters recognize, but he was a legend of the early days of the first-person shooter genre, co-founding id Software and making videogames like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Hexen, and Quake, to name a few. </p>



<p>Nowadays, he makes smaller titles at Romero Games. The studio's most recent title was the Mafia-themed turn-based strategy game Empire of Sin, launched in late 2020 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/empire-of-sin-disorganized-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a mixed reception</a>. More recently, John Romero and his fellow developers signed a deal with Microsoft for their next project, but that deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went awry along with the latest Xbox layoffs</a>. The development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not shut down</a>, though, and Romero himself <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/john-romero-we-were-about-midway-through-our-game-1624993/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has provided an update to Gamereactor</a> in an interview conducted at San Diego Comic Con Malaga. The game was halfway done, and many publishers are interested in helping with funding.</p>



<p><em>We're still figuring out what we're going to do with our big game. We own the intellectual property, we own the code, we own everything about the game. So, we have a lot of companies that are interested and still working with us on it, because when you develop a game for years and you put in, say, $50 million into a game, if you move and start working with somebody else, they get $50 million for free. So lots of people want to continue working on something, and even if that doesn't happen, you have $50 million worth of assets that you can use to make another thing. So no matter what, you are shortcutting the end of your game, right? To be able to get your game done faster, you already have a lot there already. We were about midway through our game.</em></p>



<p>Here's hoping that John Romero can find a solid publisher to bring the game through the finish line. We've already had more than enough game cancellations for this year, at least as far as I'm concerned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-we%E2%80%99re-now-the-largest-gaming-publisher-and-want-to-be-everywhere-the-real-competitor-is-tiktok.1337845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d8dA8GtE8U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a live interview on TBPN</a> (Technology Business Programming Network) discussing various topics, including the company's updated multiplatform strategy on the gaming front.</p>



<p>Nadella pointed out that following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the largest gaming publisher in terms of revenue. The goal, then, is to be everywhere the consumer is, just like with Office. The Microsoft CEO then interestingly referred to TikTok, or, to be more accurate, short-form video as a whole, as the true competitor of gaming.</p>



<p><em>Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business. And of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it. So to us, the way we're thinking about gaming is - first of all, now we're the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore, we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office.</em> <em>We're going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the PC, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</em></p>



<p><em>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward. So, I'm very looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly, the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well, because after all, the gaming's competition is not other gaming. Gaming's competition is short form video.</em></p>



<p>The Microsoft CEO clearly refers to the fact that every entertainment bit competes for the user's attention on any given day. In a recent interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the New York Times</a>, following the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> and all future Halo titles would also launch on PlayStation consoles, Xbox Game Studios president Matt Booty shared a similar comment, mentioning that everything from movies to TikTok constitutes competition nowadays.</p>



<p>During the TBPN interview, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella made another statement that might irk some people in the industry. On one hand, he stressed the need to continuously innovate to keep consumers' attention; on the other, he said that to do that, it is necessary to have 'good margins'.</p>



<p><em>If we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model, right? Best way to innovate is to have good margins, because that's the way you can fund.</em></p>



<p>However, it is a tone-deaf statement following the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> that have hit Microsoft as a whole and the gaming divisions specifically in the past couple of years. Meanwhile, Nadella's own pay grew 22% year-over-year and reached the astounding sum of $96.5 million.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-connection-lost-steam-error-fix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-%E2%80%98connection-lost%E2%80%99-steam-error-explained.1337842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the deployment of the 1.1.1.0 update in Battlefield 6, Steam players worldwide have been met with a ‘Connection Lost’ error message when trying to access the Battlefield 6 campaign. This has been addressed by Electronic Arts as a known issue, but the team has yet to provide further updates regarding a resolution.</p>



<p>In this snapshot guide, we’ll help you understand the Steam ‘Connection Lost’ error in Battlefield 6, and provide information on how to get around it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-connection-lost-error">How to Fix Connection Lost Error</h2>



<p>If you’re booting Battlefield 6 through Steam and getting a ‘Connection Lost’ error in the campaign, there are a few things you can try to workaround the issue.</p>



<p>First, <strong>restart the game and quit the Steam launcher entirely, rebooting both after a few seconds</strong>. This will clear your sessions and refresh your login to both Steam and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Second, you can try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong>, refreshing your networking connection and resetting your WAN IP to hopefully fix routing issues, if that’s the problem.</p>



<p>If you can, <strong>switch from Wi-Fi to Ethernet </strong>to eliminate any residual issues with internet speed or capabilities. As a rule, gaming is best done with an Ethernet connection, as this offers uninterrupted, unbroken links.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>disable any VPN or proxy services </strong>that you might be using, as this can cause a direct conflict with EA’s systems and servers.</p>



<p>If you want to go <strong>even deeper </strong>with network-related fixes, you can try to change your DNS settings, flush your DNS cache, or even fully reinstall Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re aware some Steam players are encountering a “Connection Lost” message when launching the Battlefield 6 campaign. Stay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1983405982584844292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-steam-specific-fixes">Steam-Specific Fixes</h3>



<p>Some users have had luck fixing the Connection Lost Battlefield 6 error by enabling Steam’s Beta Client.</p>



<p>Here’s how you do this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Open Steam</li>



<li>Click Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Interface</li>



<li>Under ‘Client Beta Participation’, select ‘Steam Beta Update’</li>



<li>Then restart Steam</li>
</ul>



<p>In the meantime, it’s worth staying connected to the <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA server status page</a> and following the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Comms page</a> on social media to stay up to date with all the issues ongoing in Battlefield 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield REDSEC Review—A Solid BR But Very Warzone Coded]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-review-br-warzone-coded/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-review%E2%80%94a-solid-br-but-very-warzone-coded.1337836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s REDSEC platform is now open for all to access, and as a free-to-play Battle Royale game, it’s doing exactly what you’d expect. There’s a large, open map, a couple of battle passes to choose from, a bunch of missions to resolve in-game, and an ever-shrinking circle of death that eventually strangles the entire lobby.</p>



<p>It’s Warzone-coded, and in many ways, that makes sense, because the leadership team piecing REDSEC together has that in their blood. Ultimately, REDSEC doesn’t offer anything in the way of any huge innovations on the Battle Royale genre, but it <strong>is </strong>a decent entry into the space that should at least be tried.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-redsec-any-good">Is Battlefield REDSEC Any Good?</h2>



<p>As a Battle Royale title, Battlefield REDSEC is everything you could hope for. Players parachute into a map from helicopters, picking their landing zone from a series of POIs, looting crates, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-missions/">kick-starting missions</a>, and fighting other players. As the game clock ticks over, the playable zone shrinks, surrounded by a ring of deadly fire.</p>



<p>It’s the same concept as Firestorm, the Battlefield 5 BR mode introduced almost seven years ago, which more or less fell flat on its face.</p>



<p>REDSEC offers all the trappings of Battlefield 6. The weapons, characters, equipment, vehicles, and movement mechanics are all pulled from the central experience, which is itself a fantastic offering. On the surface, REDSEC feels great to play; the movement is smooth and fluid, and the core elements of a Battlefield game, such as intense destruction, are&nbsp;present.</p>



<p>As you explore Fort Lyndon, the map in REDSEC, you’ll find ‘killstreaks’, challenges <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/">to unlock tanks</a> and other powerful vehicles, custom weapon drops, and kits that you can use to upgrade weapons on the fly.</p>



<p>This is where the innovations that <strong>do exist </strong>start to leech into the game, and it’s also where we see some cross-collaborative innovations coming over from games like Apex Legends, also published by Electronic Arts.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Even the Double XP token system is pulled clean from Call of Duty</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s good, but I couldn’t help but feel I was playing Warzone at times, which isn’t what you want from <strong>a direct competitor</strong>. Everything from the double XP token structure to the battle pass mechanics, and from the nature of side missions to the loadout features, REDSEC simply smacks of Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>







<h2 id="h-redsec-proves-battle-royale-is-still-going-strong">REDSEC Proves Battle Royale is Still Going Strong</h2>



<p>The Battle Royale genre is an ebb-and-flow kind of thing that never seems consistent. It has been populated over the years with multiple games, and once upon a time, developers in fringe titles threw their hat in the ring to see what they could do.</p>



<p>With that, I mean that even games like Forza Horizon and Fallout 76 once had Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>The hype surrounding REDSEC was palpable, and going into the game at launch, players were met with sizeable queues. There was a spike in traffic on streaming and content platforms, and player counts had a nice injection of energy, with Battlefield and Call of Duty fans alike eager to explore this free-to-play BR platform.</p>



<p>Even after more than a decade, the concept of the Battle Royale remains a winning one, and REDSEC takes the ball and runs with it, producing something laden with potential that might just be stable enough to challenge the likes of Warzone. </p>



<p>There’s a learning curve for sure, especially concerning the destruction capabilities of the game and some of the movement and weapon handling mechanics, but I feel that this is as accessible a Battle Royale as you could hope for.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Battlefield REDSEC map is deeply Californian</figcaption></figure>







<p>The map is great, too. It’s the kind of environment I love, fusing urban biomes with natural regions and a touch of mountainous, desert areas. It’s diverse, large enough to accommodate the player count without feeling enormous, and has plenty of nooks to explore.</p>



<h6><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Full Battlefield 6 Review</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-but-it-s-not-perfect">But It’s Not Perfect</h2>



<p>REDSEC has had issues at launch. When I played, I experienced more than my fair share of bugs and glitches:</p>



<ul>
<li>Network instability causing packet loss and rubber banding</li>



<li>Dynamic elements like custom weapon drops floating in midair</li>



<li>Weapon crates duplicating on interaction and falling into each other</li>



<li>Players falling under the map (and staying there)</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-battle-royale-redeploy-teammates/">Redeploy towers</a> throwing teammates into the fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Teething issues are commonplace these days, and it’s hardly fair to take points away from the game, but you’d imagine that REDSEC would launch in a better state given the consistency of the multiplayer platform and how much stock Electronic Arts (and associated studios) have poured into the Battle Royale platform.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Being so close to Warzone, can REDSEC ultimately escape the competition?</figcaption></figure>







<p>If you’re going to give REDSEC a try, I’d recommend picking up a battle pass (ideally the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/">BF Pro battle pass</a>) if you think you’re going to sink a few hours into it. It adds another layer of meat to the bones of the game, and you’ll have a bit more to aim for. The core gameplay loop is fulfilling enough, but BRs have a tendency to get dull quite quickly under the strain of repetition.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Electronic Arts treats Battlefield REDSEC. For now, it’s a great Battle Royale title that has everything you’d expect from a Battlefield bolt-on, and I’m certainly going to invest more than a few hours into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you think of Battlefield REDSEC.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is about to hit the market, introducing to the world one of the most popular extraction shooters around. For Embark Studios, it follows the earlier launch of The Finals, an arena-based, destructive first-person shooter that served as the studio’s debut title.</p>



<p>Embark Studios isn’t done when ARC Raiders is out, though. In a recent interview, the studio’s CEO, Patrick Soderlund, confirmed that the team is working on <strong>two new games</strong>, one of which has ‘a lot more edge to it’ than ARC Raiders or The Finals.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-the-other-is-more-conventional">But The Other is More Conventional</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Game Business, Embark’s CEO sat down to talk about the studio, its evolution, the release of ARC Raiders, and where things go from here. In one segment, the CEO, Patrick Soderlund, was asked about what other games are in development at the studio.</p>



<p>These projects are in the earlier, more conceptual stages, but there are <strong>two </strong>being pieced together. When asked if they’re all online games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONLWtl85bjU&amp;t=2141s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Soderlund explained</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That I think is just ingrained in our DNA. That doesn’t mean that they’re online games the same way as The Finals or ARC Raiders. One of the concepts we have, I would say, has a lot more <strong>edge </strong>to it than The Finals or ARC Raiders does.</p>



<p>The other one maybe is a little bit more conventional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Embark Studios has gone from strength to strength in the last few years, and the imminent arrival of ARC Raiders is a testament to the work the studio has put in. This is arguably going to be the most exciting and anticipated extraction shooter ever made, if the numbers are anything to go by.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, the extraction genre has skyrocketed, particularly with the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a>, a parody title that has sold millions of copies in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>What kind of game do you think Embark Studios should make next? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the middle of the week, and regardless of what your plans are for the day ahead, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints that you need to dominate today’s puzzle. It’s a tricky one today, and there are some very clever answers, but if you’re stumped, just read on to get the answers you need.</p>



<p>The top NYT Connections hints await.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-29">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 29)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #871:</p>



<ul>
<li>BACKBONE</li>



<li>MEDIUM</li>



<li>VENUE</li>



<li>SCRABBLE</li>



<li>SPIRIT</li>



<li>COMPUTER KEYBOARD</li>



<li>SACRUM</li>



<li>COURAGE</li>



<li>PLATFORM</li>



<li>SEYCHELLES</li>



<li>HEART</li>



<li>OUIJA BOARD</li>



<li>SEITAN</li>



<li>OUTLET</li>



<li>SÉANCE</li>



<li>ABECEDARIUM</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all relate to qualities that represent someone’s core or emotional resilience</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each term is a way to deliver content or host experiences</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each word is fun to ‘say’</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each term covers the full A to Z</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 29.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-29-871">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 29 (#871)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BACKBONE, COURAGE, HEART, SPIRIT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – MEDIUM, OUTLET, PLATFORM, VENUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – SACRUM, SEITAN, SEYCHELLES, SÉANCE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ABECEDARIUM, COMPUTER KEYBOARD, OUIJA BOARD, SCRABBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

This reimagined package comes loaded with not only the trademark HD-2D visuals, but also new features, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-remakes-brand-new-underwater-region-is-beautiful">new locations and new story content</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of our own review going live later today, the very first critic review has now been shared online. As usual, it comes from the famous Japanese publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/">Famitsu</a>. So, what is the final verdict?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067utosxg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>This follow-up to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, which is also part of The Erdrick Trilogy, has officially received a score of <strong>9/9/8/8</strong> from the four critics, giving the game a total score of <strong>34/40</strong> (<a href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92274">Ryokutya2089 via Gematsu</a>). And if you're wondering, the remake of the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/famitsu-review-scores-issue-1874">third game received</a> 8/9/9/9, adding up to a final score of 35/40.</p>
<p>So, that's the score from Famitsu for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake. If you're planning to get this game on the Switch or Switch 2, just remember that there's no upgrade path for this one. The Switch 2 version is also a Game-Key Card release.</p>

<p>Here's a teaser...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>There was recently news about the upcoming release <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> getting a demo on select platforms, and ahead of Halloween, it's now officially available on the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>You'll apparently be able to access the first levels of the game as SpongeBob and Patrick, and also some new abilities (thanks, Nintendo Everything). In general, you'll also be able to get an idea of what to expect before the full release next month on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Above is a trailer of the demo and below we have some PR about the story and adventure SpongeBob and Patrick will go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em><strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's been no official mention of a Switch release, so for now, this game remains exclusive to Switch 2 on Nintendo platforms.</p>

<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="bb4dfbf579a54"><a title="Microsoft CEO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb4dfbf579a54/microsoft-ceo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last month, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/xbox-reiterates-its-support-for-switch-2">reiterated how Xbox would support Switch 2</a> and PlayStation 5 players going forward, and now the tech giant's Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has chimed in.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142">Speaking to TBPN recently</a> about this "shifting" business model, Nadella mentioned how the company wants to be a "fantastic publisher" on every platform now that the Activision acquisition is complete and it's the "largest publisher" in the business.</p>
<p>He also compared this approach to the one Windows took with Microsoft Office. Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now we are the largest publisher after the Activision [acquisition], so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher - similar approach to what we did with Office, we want to be everywhere in every platform, so we want to make sure whether it's consoles, whether it's the pc, whether it's mobile, whether it's cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this expansion to more devices and platforms, Microsoft is still <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/huge-xbox-report-details-ambitious-next-gen-console-with-free-online-play">reportedly going ahead with its own next-generation</a> gaming plans, which will supposedly blur the lines between PC and Xbox. Nadella also seemingly backed up these reports in his latest interview while claiming Microsoft and gaming's biggest competition was no longer "other" gaming, but "short form video".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gaming's competition is not other gaming [platforms], gaming's competition is short form video. And so if we as an industry don't continue to innovate, both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model - [the] best way to innovate is to have good margins because that's the way you can fund."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These comments from Microsoft's CEO follow Xbox's huge announcement last week that it would be bringing <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/halo_campaign_evolved">Halo</a></strong> to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/halo-confirmed-for-ps5-remake-of-first-game-out-in-2026?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">PlayStation for the first time</a>. On the Nintendo front, the Bethesda games <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a></strong> (IP now under Microsoft's banner) are both on the way to the Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

<p>According to the official patch notes on Nintendo's support page, Version 1.1.4 addresses "several issues" to improve gameplay on the new hybrid hardware. Nintendo doesn't go into the specifics, but if we hear anything, we'll let you know. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Latest update: Ver. 1.1.4 (Released October 28, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Several issues have been addressed to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2. Note: The software update is required to play on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This is actually Super Mario 3D All-Stars' third update this year. The previous two versions (1.1.3 and 1.1.2) have the same patch notes as the latest game patch. Again, if we find out what's going on here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Although patches are still being released for this game, keep in mind it's no longer available to purchase on the eShop and was available for a "limited-time" in stores. It contains <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> game.</p>
<p>This update also happens to follow the recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> at the beginning of October. You can find out more about this new (<em>but old</em>) two-in-one release in our recent Nintendo Life review.</p>
