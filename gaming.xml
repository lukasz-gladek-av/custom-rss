			<p>EA confirmed that The Sims 5 wasn't and isn't in the works<span>. Instead, they are focusing on funneling more into The Sims 4, a ten-year-old title. A couple of months ago,<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">&nbsp;Project Rene</a> seemed like it was scrapped, according to a developer's resume. However,&nbsp;<span>according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">Variety's statement</a></span>, this does not seem to be</span>&nbsp;the case, and they are continuing to work on Project Rene, which is said to be a separate multiplayer project in The Sims universe.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has also confirmed that there are no plans for a successor to The Sims 4, which is currently the longest-running installment in the franchise's history. The first game was released 25 years ago. It's been confirmed that The Sims 4 will continue receiving free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>In addition to The Sims 4 continuing to receive paid content, EA has confirmed that the Sims team is working on a new project that will include a multiplayer mode, as well as partnering up with some Sims creators so that they can sell their custom in-game content through the EA store, similar to how it was done in The Sims 3.</p>
<p>Kate Gorman said that the main reason they have decided not to make The Sims 5 is an overwhelming concern that players would have to "start all over again" after a decade's worth of gameplay in The Sims 4. There are more than 80 million players worldwide, with a very active social media community. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise starts with Sims 1, and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products."</p>
<p>Recently, EA announced in a blog post that some significant fixes will be released for the game, something the fans have consistently asked for when providing feedback for EA. They are also releasing an "exciting base game update" before their upcoming expansion in October, for which they are slowly releasing information. In this <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, they revealed the Life and Death expansion, where players will get their first proper look at the content on October 3 before it releases on Halloween. So far, it seems to focus on tarot and perhaps new jobs and skills.</p>

<p>In this interview with Variety, EA also mentioned that Sims fans will get to hear more about the elusive Project Rene, which the Sims team has been working on for years. This isn't their first rodeo in trying to make a multiplayer Sims game, with The Sims Online launching in 2002 and the game shutting down entirely in 2008, which was seen as a failed experiment.</p>

The game launched alongside<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> back on the Xbox 360 and PS3. It later arrived on PC in 2015 and was also ported to Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. And while it’s been extremely popular, for nearly a decade the PC version of <em>GTA Online</em> has lacked a proper anti-cheat system to stop players from easily using mod menus and other tools to cause chaos and gain unfair advantages.

Players will still be able to enjoy <em>GTA V’</em>s story mode on Deck, but no online play is supported. </p><p>And to be clear: This isn’t entirely the fault of BattlEye, which is in many games, some of which work on the Linux-powered Steam Deck. Rockstar could, in theory, update <em>GTA Online </em>to support BattlEye on Steam Deck in a future patch, but the next part of the FAQ seems to suggest that might not happen. Here’s what Rockstar says about <em>GTA V</em> on Steam Deck: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Note:</strong> GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community.</p></blockquote><p>That seems like Rockstar washing its hands of the situation and moving on. Maybe I’m wrong, but I wouldn’t hold my breath that<em> GTA Online</em> will ever  be playable on Steam Deck again. </p><p>In other “Rockstar updating stuff” news, an update for the publisher’s PC launcher included some folders referencing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GTA 6 </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p>The files were quickly removed and as far as I can tell, there wasn’t anything too exciting in there. But, it’s just more evidence that Rockstar seems to be working on a PC port of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a></span>. That open-world western has been trapped on consoles ever since it launched in 2010. Over the last year or so, evidence seems to be building that maybe, just maybe, <em>RDR </em>will finally get the PC port it deserves. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has released an updated Year One roadmap for its free-to-play shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xdefiant/" data-ref-id="5000-534971">XDefiant</a>, highlighting important changes and new content coming down the road. The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is dying, stating that the game is in a healthy state and that Ubisoft has provided additional resources to the team to fix some of the larger issues, like hit registration.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG">blog post</a> starts by addressing the issues players have been having with the hit registration in XDefiant, which doesn't work as reliably as some other multiplayer shooters. The simplified explanation given is that currently packets are sent twice between players, but the industry standard is four times. In order to achieve this, the XDefiant team needs to reduce the size of their packets so they can send them more times. No solid release date was given, but the team hopes to make significant progress by the end of Season 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766"></a><figcaption>Season 2 will add the Highwaymen from Far Cry New Dawn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is in trouble at Ubisoft, although it doesn't respond directly to some of the claims. The report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> from late August stated that XDefiant player numbers have dropped off significantly since launch and that if Season 3 doesn't turn things around, the game could be in danger of shutting down. The blog post states that "no, the game is absolutely not dying," and reiterates that quality-of-life improvements are high on the priority list.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also includes an updated roadmap for XDefiant. It reiterates that each season will include three new maps, three new guns, and a new faction to play, but now it also lists progression changes and quality of life changes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-shipped-61-7-million-units-xbox-series-sold-28-3-ww-as-of-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the rocky economy of both Xbox and PlayStation, PlayStation consistently comes out on top. Even since the PlayStation 2 came out, it has always been ahead of the curve. However, the gap closed between the PS3 and Xbox 360, with the PS3 coming out by 7.5 million units. Skipping to the present day, the PlayStation 5 has sold a <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/aldora-intelligence-ps5-61-7m-xbs-28-3m-shipments-end-of-june-2024.3005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly higher amount of units</a>, with a number of 61.7 million units being sold compared to the Xbox Series X|S, which has only sold 28.3 million units as of June 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a video released by WSJ on YouTube, they did a deep dive into why the Xbox has failed in the market, specifically the Xbox Series X|S. To some, it may come as a surprise, as Microsoft constantly reminded people in their advertising that the Xbox Series X was the most powerful console they'd ever made. Yet, it still just didn't have enough benefits to warrant buying. At least with PlayStation, there are exclusives, with some making their way to PC. Xbox hasn't had any exclusive games in a while. Xbox was needed to play games like Halo and Gears of War. However, the launch of their subscription service meant that you no longer needed a console for that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Lost the Console War. Now It’s Redefining Gaming. | WSJ The Economics Of" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuZtbsSrdwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multiple reports and data have suggested that they have definitively lost the console war to PlayStation and even the Nintendo Switch. Therefore, they are now shifting their focus onto the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Xbox Game Pass subscription service</a> to try and funnel money back into Microsoft and their gaming sector.</p>
<p>As stated in the video, when consoles were first introduced to the gaming industry and players, they were often sold as cheaply as possible. This means the companies were selling them at a loss to try to entice people into gaming and become frequent customers. For Xbox, they lose $200 per console. Even though Xbox is the main focus of this video, it can't be forgotten that PlayStation has also been struggling financially as of late. So much so that the original PlayStation 5 has seen price increases in multiple parts of the world. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">Japan saw a $90 increase</a> in both console versions, and the US saw a $5 increase in the Dualshock controllers.</p>
<p>Then, Sony announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. Immediately, fans were unhappy. Not only was the price extortionate for what it is, but the features it came with didn't make the console feel worthwhile. On top of that, those who want a physical game collection will have to fork out an extra sum of money to purchase a disk drive and the console's stand.</p>
<p>PlayStation may be on top, with 61.7 million units sold worldwide as of June 2024. Still, with their recent decisions regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro, it's becoming increasingly likely that they won't see as many sales as previous consoles they've made. It's already affected the market, as people in Japan are suddenly flocking to buy an<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-sales-increase-japan/"> Xbox Series console</a> rather than fork out for the PlayStation 5 pro. It may be possible that Nintendo will come out on top when they announce the successor of the Nintendo Switch.</p>

As part of an investor presentation today, the company officially announced the EA Sports app, which will soft launch for iOS and Android in Spain this fall.</p><p>In a press release, EA says the app will be a “socially-driven app” with features like a discovery feed to keep up to date on news and highlights from their favorite teams, interactive challenges you can play during and after live games, and community “arenas.” With the soft launch in Spain, the app will have “a combination of sports content, live sports data, social messaging, interactivity, challenges and more centered on Global Football in collaboration with longstanding partner LaLiga,” EA says.&nbsp;</p><p>EA also says that it aims to add more sports to the app in the future.

Widowmaker’s is based on antagonist Sylvanas Windrunner, who was an original inspiration for the sniper during <em>Overwatch</em>’s early development. While she’s shown with a bow similar to the one wielded by the <em>Warcraft </em>character in the new highlight intro released as part of the event, she still wields a rifle during regular gameplay. The bow also goes away if you use the highlight intro with any skin other than the Sylvanas one. Reinhardt, meanwhile, dons blue armor in tribute to the Lich King, the undead villain of the <em>Wrath of the Lich King </em>expansion. Zenyatta has one of the more surprising skins, as he takes on the visage of the orc Thrall instead of anything that would be more immediately compatible with his synthetic monk aesthetic. Props to Blizzard for thinking outside the box on that one. Lastly, Torbjörn takes on the diamond form of King Magni Bronzebeard.</p><p>If you’re a <em>Warcraft </em>diehard, the skins are pretty great, but like those in previous <em>Overwatch 2</em> collaboration events, they are expensive. The bundles are purchased with in-game currency, which is obtainable through the battle pass. However, you’ll most likely have to use some real money to reach the necessary amount, as the battle pass doesn’t give you enough coins to purchase any of the bundles:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Warcraft Mega Bundle: 5700</li><li>Sylvanas Widowmaker 2600</li><li>Lich King Reinhardt 2600 </li><li>Thrall Zenyatta 2500</li><li>Diamond Magni Torbjörn 2400</li></ul><p>If you’re just interested in the skins themselves and not the other cosmetics, you can buy them for slightly cheaper through the Heroes menu.

<p dir="ltr">Each of the four studios working on the game are contributing to different aspects of it. DICE is handling the trademark multiplayer the franchise is known for with help from Criterion. Additionally, Criterion is also working on the single-player campaign for the next Battlefield alongside Motive. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a mysterious "new Battlefield experience."</p><p dir="ltr">"They're working on a new Battlefield experience fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA that's been testing really well with players," Beede said. He did not go into additional detail as to what the mode would entail.</p><p dir="ltr">Beede went on to say that the teams are building a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-to-build-a-connected-battlefield-universe-more-experiences-on-the-way/1100-6498518/" data-ref-id="1100-6498518">Battlefield connected universe</a> set in the modern day, and that with the full support of EA, the next Battlefield game has the "largest, strongest, and most focused team" in the history of the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Few other details about the next Battlefield have been revealed, but head of Respawn and Battlefield boss Vince Zampella did recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-returns-to-modern-setting-and-makes-other-key-changes-fans-asked-for/1100-6526511/" data-ref-id="1100-6526511">confirm the game will have a modern setting</a> and that the new entry in the series will be "more akin to previous Battlefields."</p><p dir="ltr">That means fewer player counts compared to the 128-player matches seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a> and that 2042's Specialist system won't be returning, with the new game instead returning to class-based gameplay. He said while Battlefield 2042 wasn't a failure and that the team spent "a lot of time learning" to get it into a better place, the goal with the new entry is for it to be "good out of the gate."</p><p dir="ltr">Zampella said he believes there is a possibility the next Battlefield game could outsell Call of Duty, though he acknowledged that the two series are distinct and offer different experiences to fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 2042 released in 2021 and was quickly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">criticized for its buggy launch</a> and changes to the classic Battlefield formula. Many of Battlefield 2042's maps and systems were dramatically reworked in the years since launch with the game's Season 7 update, released in March, being its final season.</p>

EA's initially discussed its new strategy for the long-running life sim series in an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">extensive blog post</a>, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> franchise general manager Kate Gorman later shared additional context in an <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/">interview with Variety</a>. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise started with Sims 1 and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products," Gorman explained. "[But now,] we are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we're only going to be adding to our universe."
</p>
<p>
"What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a 5," Gorman continued, "but it doesn't mean that we're going to start you over... As we think about the future of it, we want you to continue all of those families and generations. Those creations are your progress, your attachment. We don't want to reset your progress. And so it's not about... what the numbers are in the games, but know that the future of the franchise looks more like keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience, and not a start-and-stop experience between products."

<p>
And while the now ten-year-old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> will continue to be "a foundational Sims experience" - receiving new expansions, updates, fixes, and "modernisation" - EA says it's also focused on creating games that'll "touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games". Notably, Project Rene - the "next generation Sims game and creative platform" EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">announced</a> in 2022 - is also still in the works.
</p>
<p>
Two years on, Project Rene remains rather nebulous, but EA's latest update describes it as being focused on "building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world". Quite how that will ultimately differ from a The Sims 5 remains to be seen, but EA says it'll be holding a small invite-only play test via its new Sims Labs initiative this autumn, "giving an early look at a multiplayer experience that explores joining friends and other players at a shared location." Sign ups are <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/sims-labs-playtest-registration">happening now</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the promise of "meaningful new features and base game updates" for The Sims 4 - alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-pledges-more-bug-fixes-more-often-as-it-looks-to-address-years-of-frustrating-technical-issues">continuing</a> quality assurance and game optimisation efforts - EA has announced new The Sims 4 Creator Kits and confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-the-sims-movie-adaptation">previously rumoured Sims movie</a>. Creator Kits, as their name implies, are new bits of DLC designed and built by community creators then published by EA, with the first arriving in November 2024.
</p>
<p>
As for The Sims movie, it's being developed alongside Amazon MGM Studios, with Loki and Sex Education director Kate Herron at the helm. Herron will co-write the script with Briony Redman - the pair having previously written the Rogue episode of this year's Doctor Who. "It's still too early to share more about the movie," EA adds in its announcement, "but stay tuned for updates as we mark our 25th birthday next year!"
</p>
<p>Before all that, The Sims 4's release schedule continues this Thursday, 19th September, with the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-artist-studio-and-storybook-nursery-dlc-out-next-week">Artist Studio and Storybook Nursery DLC</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">still-mysterious Life and Death Expansion Pack</a> arrives on 31st October. Additionally, EA previously confirmed MySims and MySims Kingdom are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">heading to Switch</a> as a two-game bundle on 19th November.

			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has released Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the second game in the studio's franchise, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. During EA's Investor Relations day, the publisher has also confirmed that Respawn is working on the third and final chapter of the trilogy. Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, said to investors:</p>
<p><em>We have delivered some of the highest quality and best-selling Star Wars games of all-time, with over $5 billion in net bookings. This impressive track record includes of course the Star Wars Jedi games, where over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players.</em></p>
<p>Unlike Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor, the next installment will have to be spearheaded by someone other than Stig Asmussen. The industry veteran, who is also credited for being the director of God of War III, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-director-stig-asmussen-leaves-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> Respawn a year ago. In March 2024, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Giant Skull, a new triple-A studio working on an action/adventure game powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor got an 8.3/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Star Wars: Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give it full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

<p>The game had many performance issues at launch, but Respawn kept working on it. The latest patch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-9-performance-improvements-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a few days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-update-9-didnt-resolve-stuttering-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed </a>most (but not all) of the shortcomings.</p>

At the time of the first game’s release, I wasn’t really aware that there was much interest in the goings-on of a bunch of teenagers in the Pacific Northwest. Boy, was I wrong, because nowadays <em>Life Is Strange </em>is a core franchise for Square Enix, comprising a number of sequels, spinoffs, and even comics that are, among other things, frequently diverse and transgressive in their subject matter. I appreciate the <em>Life Is Strange </em>series a lot, even if I sometimes feel like I’ve aged out of their young-adult trappings. Now—with a new game on the horizon and plenty of older games on sale—is the best time to catch up on the series before the latest installment in a little over a month.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming game, titled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a></span>, is pretty significant since it breaks from the series’ loosely established anthology framework. Characters have carried over between installments, and the games will often nudge (or sometimes shove) you into the direction of an easter egg or reference, but for the most part, every game has featured its own story and cast. <em>Double Exposure </em>defies that unspoken sentiment by once again featuring the first game’s protagonist, Max Caulfield. This time, Max is a young adult in her 20s, years after the events of the first <em>Life Is Strange</em>, but she is once again tasked with solving a murder. This time around, instead of rewinding time, Max now has the ability to shift into other timelines and realities, and tries to use this to save her friend, Safi, from ever being killed in the first place.<br></p><p>Given the fact that <em>Double Exposure </em>will be picking back up with Max, you probably owe it to yourself to see where her journey begins. <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection </strong></em><strong>is currently going for $16 on Xbox and features remasters of both the original game and its spinoff prequel, </strong><em><strong>Before The Storm</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The main title plays from Max’s perspective, who returns to her hometown of Arcadia Bay in high school after some time away and reconnects with her childhood best friend, Chloe Price, who becomes the protagonist of the prequel. Along the way, they painfully stumble through stereotypical hurdles of teenagedom, including bullying, suicide, family tragedies, sexuality, and more. <em>Life Is Strange </em>is often hurt by its clunky attempts at trying to capture the language and thinking of teenagers of the era, but it gets by on its earnestness, sentimentality, and themes of nostalgia vs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049">living in the moment</a></span>.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387"><em>Life Is Strange 2</em> is thought of as the dark horse of the pack</a></span>, so it should come as no surprise that it’s my favorite. Following Sean and Daniel, a pair of Latino brothers, it charts their journey across the American west coast as they flee from the law after a supernatural incident prompts a cop to shoot and kill their father. It’s a much rawer game than the first, having released a few years into Donald Trump’s presidency, and due to these factors, it unflinchingly deals with topics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112">racism</a></span> and violence towards minorities. Sean, the older of the two brothers and the game’s protagonist, is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345">repeatedly battered</a></span> over the course of the game in a way that neither of the other game’s protagonists are, and by the end, this felt like a very pointed commentary on how the United States treats people who can’t possibly be white-passing.</p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>is also interesting because the playable character isn’t the one who has powers. Instead it’s Daniel, Sean’s younger brother, who manifests telekinetic powers, and as his only remaining role model, Sean’s moral choices don’t just affect him, but Daniel’s upbringing too. You can raise him to be a righteous person or someone willing to bend the rules with his newfound powers to get his way. David’s AI makes choices at points in the story that weigh the lessons Sean has passed off to him, which threatens to complicate their relationship further. It is one of the most distinctive social systems I’ve seen implemented into a game, occasionally shocking me with some of the results, and is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123">fascinating lens through which players can view a relationship</a></span> between brothers who belong to an entirely different culture than the assumed hegemony. </p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>doesn’t stick its landing, in my opinion, but its brazenness and ambition go a long way, and I’ve yet to see a game come even close to it in the intervening years. <strong>You can get the entirety of </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange 2 </strong></em><strong> for just $6.39 on Xbox, and given that it’s currently Hispanic Heritage Month, consider it your responsibility to pick this game up.</strong><br></p><p>Finally, we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961"><em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em></a></span>. The latest installment in the series, <em>True Colors </em>follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259">Alex Chen</a></span>, who moves to the idyllic and picturesque town of Haven Springs in Colorado to be reunited with her older brother Gabe. Here she tries to start a new life after bouncing around a lot as a teenager and never having any real stability. She befriends the locals and begins to fall in love with them and the town when her brother unceremoniously passes away. The rest of the game—which, in a break from form, was released altogether rather than episodically—has Alex and her friends investigate the town and the corporation whose tendrils can be felt everywhere, in an effort to divine who allowed Gabe to die. Alex has an upper hand in this case though, because she is an empath (no, a real one) capable of seeing the emotions of people around her and peeking into their minds. </p><p><em>True Colors </em>is robust and sound, but it’s also familiar and occasionally incurious, unlike the first two games. It is not without some gut punches, and one of its sequences contains some of the very best and most emotionally substantive work in the whole series, but more often than not, it just felt like a step back. For example, it felt way too in love with the idea of a place like Haven Springs, which seemed to blind the team from interrogating its politics more. The town isn’t perfect, but <em>True Colors</em> seems to think it’s pretty close, which is far removed from the lens that is held up to both Arcadia Bay in the original game, and the wider U.S in its sequel. It’s a little too cloying for my taste, but if comfort is a thing you come to games and this series for, <em>True Colors </em>has got you.<br></p><p><strong>For $18, you can vacation in Colorado with Alex Chen and her friends in <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>. Alternatively, you can pay $21 to get the deluxe edition, which has a prequel episode following Steph, one of <em>True Colors’ </em>romanceable characters, or get the ultimate edition for $32, containing the aforementioned content <em>and </em>the <em>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection</em>.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, all of these games are pretty lean. Each episode of the first two games is less than or equal to a handful of hours on average, so you could easily spend a weekend on each one. Even <em>True Colors</em> is still structured episodically and can be completed in roughly the same amount of time, meaning that they’ll hardly overstay their welcome. Pick ‘em up now and dig into some particularly emotional stories ahead of <em>Double Exposure</em>’s release at the end of October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Project T, the 1-4 player PvE co-op shooter from Midwinter Entertainment and Behaviour Interactive, has been cancelled. The <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement came via social media</a> on Tuesday from the studio.</p>



<p>According to Behaviour Interactive, results of a risk assessment after recent playtests “yielded unsatisfactory overall results”. This led to the decision to end development of the game immediately.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“When we conceptualized this project, we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which led to the creation of this Insider Program,” the studio said. </p>



<p>“This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on Project T’s core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game. Following the playtest in July, we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective. While a number of you expressed appreciation for what you played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results.”</p>



<p>They closed the statement by saying the decision was made with a heavy heart while thanking players for their support.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for the studio and the developers working on the game, that is unknown. Nothing else regarding other projects within the company were mentioned with the announcement.</p>



<p>The last time players got a look at Project T <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was back in May.</a> Since then, the news had been quite until the announcement of its cancellation.</p>



<p>What do you think of Project T being cancelled? Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>The next new Battlefield Game isn’t just going to be an EA game made by DICE. Instead, there will be four different studios working on the next game.</p>



<p>EA held its Investor Day 2024 conference on Tuesday, and gave a bit more information on who will be developing the game, and in what fashion.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-skate-heads-to-early-access-in-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-heads-to-early-access-in-2025/">Skate Heads To Early Access In 2025</a></h6>



<p>According to the company, DICE will focus on the game’s multiplayer online. Motive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was announced to be moving</a> to Battlefield earlier this year, will work on the game’s single player offering. Criterion Games, which worked on Battlefield V and 2024 as well as the Need For Speed franchise, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/criterion-battlefield-ea-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working on both</a> single player and multiplayer. Lastly, Ripple Effect is working on a “new experience” that will be announced in the future.</p>



<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier Insider Gaming exclusive</a> regarding features for the next Battlefield game. The game will feature a return to 64-player maps, a classed-based system, and will release sometime in 2025. Insider Gaming has also learned that the next Battlefield game will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play Battle Royale mode</a>. It’s unclear if that’s the “new experience” Ripple Effect is working on.</p>



<p>More information on the game will be unveiled at a later date, including a first look at gameplay, modes, a release date, and more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 Is So Much Bigger Than A Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-is-so-much-bigger-than-a-sequel.983649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m just starting Chapter 3 of <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s story mode, but I already want to start the whole game over. It’s the curse of city-builders, or at least when I play them: learning more as you go and realizing how much better things could be if only you’d done something different further back, realizing the ways you’ve hamstrung your little civilization by building on shoddy foundations. But I’m too attached to my version of New London–all its demanding people, and its struggling satellite towns, and the direction my whole society is moving in– to turn back now.</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> comes out Friday for PC, and<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1835831410138996963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> later</a> for consoles, but people who preordered can play it today. It’s a sequel to 11 bit studio’s 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-be-playing-the-brutal-city-builder-frostpunk-1825656934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wintery, steampunk city-builder</a>, where you created a circular city around a vital, heat-giving generator, and then dealt with all your tiny citizens being pissed off at everything you did afterwards. The sequel does away with the circle and the clustered city, leaning into a hex-based sprawl that extends into the iced-over wastelands outside your city too.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWlLOpqIYjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While I miss the spatial constraints of the first game, I appreciate what <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is doing with its new shape. It feels like it wants to be a <em>bigger </em>game in every way, asking you to think about civilization as a whole. In terms of city planning, you first have to “frostbreak” a required number of hexes before you can build on them, and then instead of constructing buildings you construct entire districts. These districts have specific functions: extracting necessary items like materials, food, coal, or oil; industrial areas that can produce goods, needed to keep people happy and crime down, or prefabs, which are required for building; housing for your rapidly growing population; or logistics areas that create scouts to explore the snowy frostlands beyond. I found frostbreaking a little annoying, feeling like an extra step and cost, but it embodies the vibe of <em>effort</em> that defines the game. The snow isn’t just for aesthetics here; <em>of course</em> you’d have to break the ice before you could build.</p><p>This grander physical scale also means a more zoomed-out, complicated experience. Time moves in weeks instead of days, and districts require huge amounts of workers to function, requiring massive populations that come with the downside of requiring more resources. Things feel less intimate than in the first game, and while individual citizens still pop up with stories to tell and requests to make, I found myself thinking about them more as numbers, like any other resource. Instead of managing a little city, you’re managing an entire civilization, and the unique people within it started to fade into the back of my brain in favor of focusing on my need for more space and more resources.</p><figure><figcaption>An overlay of the different districts. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>Your local resources will eventually run out, requiring expanding into the outlying areas, setting up new mini-civilizations and connecting them to your main city via trails or higher-capacity skyways. In the story mode’s prologue, you have to get a generator in an old train up and running; later in the story, you return to create a colony that can extract oil to send back to your main city of New London. I did<em> terribly</em> by these isolated, necessary colonists, putting them on extra shifts pumping oil and then shipping all of it away to heat my main city and provide resources for other outposts or settlements. (There are three different names for the outlying areas you can set up; suffice it to say they have different levels of management required, and are differently affected by weather events.) When workers died during emergency shifts, I just sent more workers, creating housing and food shortages. At one point, a group of nomads demanded the colony stockpile oil for them, but I just kept sending that oil away because the city needed it more, leading to a slaughter that at least solved my resource shortages. When a whiteout weather event set in, interrupting the flow of resources and creating a crisis in New London, I basically abandoned the little oil colony completely to focus on the city. I returned to just a handful of survivors, and am now faced with getting the whole thing back up and running on top of my guilt.</p><p>In one way, I really like this mechanic: juggling so many moving pieces and competing needs, zooming in and out to make sure my whole system is working. In another way, it felt a little busy at times. I had to fiddle with a lot of moving resources around to supply or upgrade areas: my oil colony had its own economy, but to get needed oil to my food-producing settlement, I had to send it from the colony to the city first, and this is just one minor example of all the resource moving and balancing and stockpiling the game requires. It all feels engagingly hands-on, but also a little bit complicated for the sake of being complicated. Whether this is a good or bad thing is down to your personal tastes, but I admire that the sequel is more than just a rehash. It stays true to the original’s focus on balancing competing demands, but expands that out into every aspect of the game in a way that gives you both more demands to balance and more control over how you do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is, of course, still a focus on people, one of the notable qualities of the first game. Here, there’s a whole council to wrangle with, full of communities and factions with their own worldviews, goals, and opinions on your leadership. You’ll need to get enough of them on your side to pass the laws you want to pass and shape your city to your whims. Early on, my delinquent youth were causing crime; my options were to institute mandatory schooling, supported by the forward-thinking Evolvers faction, or mandatory apprenticeships, supported by the traditionalist Faithkeeper faction. Each of these groups had their minds made up, which left my two communities, the New Londoners and Frostlanders, somewhere in the middle. (As with the outlying areas above, there are different kinds of groups of people: factions arise from communities and have more opinions, and will hold rallies or take aggressive actions on their own.) To sway those undecided delegates to my choice, I could promise them things: offering to build the Frostlanders a survivalist headquarters (makes them happy; decreases my exploration time), or pass a law about machine-centric work shifts that would please the New Londoners (making districts require less workers; increasing squalor and thus wear on my districts). Or, I could avoid negotiating altogether by just holding the vote and seeing how things panned out.</p><figure><figcaption>The council chambers (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>The council feature’s bigger, more complicated take on the first game’s moral choices is a lot of fun, asking you to balance your goals with the demands of different groups of people and do a certain bit of manipulating to get what you want. You can fail your promises, accidentally or on purpose, turning groups against you and sowing distrust, too much of which will end your game. You can also micromanage these relationships a great deal, giving or taking money from groups, letting them choose what laws you vote on, or letting them take special actions. Factions and communities give your civilization a grand, messy personality that I felt like part of more than its commander; when I started, I wanted to side with the Faithkeepers, but the city kept going in the direction of the Evolvers because they kept bringing me useful demands and innovations. Where I sometimes didn’t love how many new pieces the expanded city-building has, I was delighted by all of the politicking and voting and micromanaging of the human side of things, down to the lovely council chambers graphic and all its mumbling, cheering members.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll notice all the little distinctions and explanations I bracketed out above, like the differences between factions and communities, or outposts, settlements, and colonies. <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s bigger scale introduces what I found to be sometimes too much complexity, especially in my first time through the game. There’s a hefty text tutorial that, while helpful as a constant reference, didn’t always feel like it was introduced to me at the right time. I should be very clear that some of this is surely down to my own lifelong struggle to be patient during tutorials, and that the onboarding might have changed by the game’s final release. You’ll also benefit from guides and videos; in a couple instances where I watched people’s playthroughs of the game’s open beta, things were much easier for me to understand when I saw them in action. Some of my confusion might also be down to the game’s new perspective: a bigger city and more things to manage makes it easier to lose track of certain specifics, and while the game does a good job of using icons to show you where something’s gone wrong, it can take a bit of poking in tooltips and submenus to understand exactly why, and sometimes tweaks to your whole system to fix. Combined with a whole new lexicon and every building action’s various resource requirements (I haven’t even touched on the money-like heatstamps and how you get them, or the findable cores required for certain upgrades, or the research tree), <em>Frostpunk 2</em> has <em>a lot</em> going on. Sometimes this felt like it made my experience better, but other times it felt like it just made my experience <em>more</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>A tooltip showing the resources of a certain kind of hub, which gives a glimpse of the things you'll juggle in the game. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>While the story mode’s fail states don’t make it a great learning environment in some ways, it does help you figure out how to deal with and prioritize the things you’ll face in its open game mode. Moments of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed were balanced by learning more about why the game’s many pieces mattered as I clumsily banged them together and saw what the outcomes were. The more I played, the more I could see the possibilities behind the things that confused or overwhelmed me on their first introduction. Like many city-builders, and like the first game, it feels like one where you’ll want to embrace failure as a learning experience, and where mastering what it’s doing will give you a ton of control to experiment and roleplay. I’m excited to improve at it, and to learn from and be inspired by what other players do. I am bravely resisting the urge to nuke my starter city because I’m not the player–or city leader–I was when I started; this sense of growing control feels like I’m improving as a leader alongside my civilization’s improvements.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> isn’t just more <em>Frostpunk</em>, something I would have been happy with. It’s bigger and more complicated and more demanding and more personalizable in every aspect, all while staying true to the heart and ethos of the first game. That’s no small feat, and it’s exciting to see in a sequel. It's a game that knows what it wants to talk about and what it wants you to play with. Even when I felt like I had way too much to do, the way any beleaguered city leader might, I was excited to come back for more.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the most interesting thing about the announcement  wasn’t the fact that the China-based studio is still using Kickstarter for their projects, or that the new game will feature town management in addition to building. </p><p>Instead, it was the platforms that the game is expected to come to. “Pathea is committed to launching <em>My Time At Evershine</em> on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced,” the studio wrote in a press release, seemingly the first time someone has explicitly mentioned what <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-console-tech-release-date-1851200648">could be a Switch 2</a></span> in marketing materials. And the Kickstarter itself is set to go live on September 24, which is in-and-around the last time Nintendo could sneak in a September Direct.</p><p>It could all be coincidence or just savvy marketing, but it comes a day after the CEO of Limited Run Games  posted a photo of himself outside of Nintendo of America. “We had an awesome visit to Nintendo of America today! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LimitedRunJosh/status/1835864911022583869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LimitedRunJosh/status/1835864911022583869" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Joshua Fairhurst outside the headquarters. “I am grateful that we have such great partners at NoA.” </p><p>“So, not to be a conspiracy theorist, but a LOT of developers seemingly got invited to visit Nintendo yesterday.

Then again, breaking the mold is kind of Nintendo’s whole thing. Hopefully we’ll find out soon enough just how drastically the <em>Mario</em> maker decides to zig instead of zag this time around. At least then fans will have something tangible to talk about. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
