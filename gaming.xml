            <p>It‚Äôs been almost a decade since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rebel-galaxy">Rebel Galaxy</a> ably picked up the sci-fi trading and exploration mantle handed down by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a>, but it looks like a successor to the serene galaxy-venturing vibes of both is finally upon us. Star Trucker is exactly what it sounds like, transplanting the chill A-to-Z courier journeys of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> to the interplanetary, uh, roads of space. It‚Äôs out this September, and it looks wonderful.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unlike Rebel Galaxy and Freelancer, Star Trucker keeps its galaxy nice and peaceful, doing away with any threat of combat in favour of focusing on the hauling of your cargo to your destination.</p>
<p>That doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be the chance of some drama, mind - the burning heat and light of nearby suns mean you might need to drop the cab‚Äôs windscreen shield, while taking too much damage from collisions and the harsh conditions of space means you‚Äôll have to strap on a spacesuit and conduct some repairs on a spacewalk or risk needing a tow across the cosmos. As well as delivering your legit cargo to earn cash, unlock new jobs and upgrade your rig, you‚Äôll also have the option to stop off and sell smaller goods - and even flog contraband - for some bonus money.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, it looks to be a game to sit back and relax to, plotting your route before turning on the radio and firing up your rocket-powered lorry. The radio will infuse plenty of that good ol‚Äô Americana feel into your deep-space trucking with a choice of genres that‚Äôd feel right at home on a Top Gear driving music compilation - ‚Äústarburst blues, galactic rock and asteroid-infused americana‚Äù - as well as the ability to chat with fellow space truckers (all fully voiced) for gossip, request docking to a station or issue an emergency SOS if you need it.</p>
<p>Alice B (RPS in Peace) seemed impressed by Star Trucker‚Äôs bonafide simulation credentials <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/egx-highlights-8-great-games-from-the-rezzed-zone-you-need-to-play">when she checked it out at EGX last year</a>, along with the fact you get a glove compartment and a call sign for the CB radio.</p>
<p>Star Trucker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/">already has a demo on Steam</a> you can go and try yourself if you‚Äôre curious, ahead of its newly-revealed release date on September 3rd. It‚Äôll also hit Game Pass on day one, so you‚Äôll be able to give the full thing a go for free then too.</p>

  <p id="6LHmIN"><strong>Wondrous Tails</strong> (commonly abbreviated as <strong>WT</strong>) is one of the most important weeklies in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, giving you rewards for doing duties and helping you clear new content. It‚Äôs kind of like bingo and you‚Äôll get more rewards for getting more lines in a row.</p>
<p id="4ktFkU">Below we detail how Wondrous Tails works in <em>FFXIV</em>, how to unlock Wondrous Tails, the rewards you can get, and how to get three lines.</p>
<hr id="EhJms6">

<p id="fT2Qk0">Every week, Khloe Aliapoh, a young Miqo‚Äôte in Idyllshire, will give you a book to fill out. In exchange for tales of your triumph, she will give you <strong>stickers</strong>. Line up four stickers in a row on the four-by-four grid and you‚Äôll get a special prize. You can get nine stickers total, so if you get more lines, you‚Äôll get bigger prizes.</p>
<p id="zWsrZZ">The Wondrous Tails book is a <strong>key item</strong>, and you can use the item to open the book. You can earn stickers by completing the duties displayed on the left side of the book and you can see the stickers you have on the right side.</p>
<p id="ZRampO">For every assigned duty you complete, Khloe will give you a <strong>sticker in a random spot on the grid</strong>. Ideally, you want at least one line before the book expires during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24118981/reset-daily-weekly-times-server-time">weekly reset</a> (it says when the book goes bad on the top left), to get some good rewards.</p>

<p id="WwTI5W">If you are in a party with anyone clearing any content for the first time, you‚Äôll get a ‚Äú<strong>Second Chance</strong>,‚Äù as displayed below the grid of duties. For example, you‚Äôll get a second chance if you queue in Trials Roulette and get a new player completing ‚ÄúThe Striking Tree‚Äù for the first time, even if it‚Äôs not on your list of Wondrous Tails duties for that week.</p>
<p id="plfAEh">You can use Second Chances to ‚Äú<strong>retry</strong>,‚Äù marking a cleared duty as uncleared (making it so you can earn another sticker from completing that same duty) and moving the clear to a different duty. You can also use two Second Chances to ‚Äú<strong>shuffle</strong>,‚Äù <strong>rerolling where your stickers are on your grid</strong>. This is super important if you‚Äôre going for a specific amount of lines.</p>
<p id="MIwp71">Once you have nine stickers in your book, return it to Khloe to get your rewards. If your book expires before you do this (even if it‚Äôs complete), you will not be able to claim any rewards.</p>
<hr id="OyczY7">
<h2 id="D4VWeA"><strong>How to unlock Wondrous Tails in FFXIV</strong></h2>
<p id="sT0avz">To unlock Wondrous Tails, you need to complete the level 60 quest ‚Äú<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/1e9e056a547/">Keeping Up with the Aliapohs</a>‚Äù (lol). You can pick this quest up from the <strong>‚ÄúUnctuous Adventurer‚Äù NPC in Idyllshire</strong>.</p>
<p id="dHXxGP">The NPC will have the blue quest marker with the plus sign above their head, so you should be able to find them on your map.</p>
<hr id="h4TihC">
<h2 id="lyZpjn"><strong>Wondrous Tails rewards</strong></h2>
<p id="01KKbU">Khloe will offer the same rewards for lines, though the type of Tomestones rewarded vary depending on the patch. There are some exceptions, as some rewards will change to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24125345/tomestones-poetics-what-to-spend-cap">Poetics</a> if a new patch that changes tomestones is about to come out. You‚Äôll also only get certain Tomestones if you have at least one job at max level. You will have to pick one reward from the following, depending on how many lines you got:</p>
<ul>
<li id="heOQ7G">
<strong>9 Seals</strong>: 500 Allagan Tomestones of Poetics, an Allagan Platinum Piece, or a treasure map from the current expansion</li>
<li id="znBO6p">
<strong>1 line</strong>: 1 MGP Gold Card (worth 30,000 MGP, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24067651/gold-saucer-unlock-side-quest-location-manderville-mgp">Gold Saucer</a> currency), 1 Khloe‚Äôs Bronze Certificate of Commendation, or 300 high-value tomes</li>
<li id="LYBgAf">
<strong>2 lines</strong>: 2 MGP Gold Cards, 1 Khloe‚Äôs Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1,000 lower-value tomes</li>
<li id="uYDUS8">
<strong>3 lines</strong>: 20 MGP Gold Cards, 3 Khloe‚Äôs Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1 Khloe‚Äôs Gold Certificate of Commendation</li>
</ul>
<p id="lVhQLt">If your book is complete with nine seals, you‚Äôll also get <strong>50% of a level‚Äôs worth of EXP on whatever job you turn the book in with</strong>. That said, you should make sure to turn in the book on a job that isn‚Äôt maxed to make the most of the rewards.</p>

<p id="bdmyZr">Each of Khloe‚Äôs certificates have their own item exchange when you talk to Khloe. The rewards for each type are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="uQWknh">
<strong>Bronze Certificates</strong>: Clusters for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24124503/materia-location-how-to-get-meld-overmeld-pentameld">materia</a>, minions, and magicked prisms</li>

<strong>Silver Certificates</strong>: Glamour accessories, older ornate armor, clusters for materia, minions, and a framer‚Äôs kit</li>
<li id="dmXY2I">
<strong>Gold Certificates</strong>: Sabotender de la Luna Whistle, Magicked Children‚Äôs Bed, Wondrous Lanner Whistle, Troll Horn, Calydontis Horn, Incitatus Whistle, clusters for materia, and ornate armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="w5dmpZ">Keep in mind that almost everything that Khloe will trade you can be bought from the marketboard, though at a high price. (The mounts you get from the gold certificates can sell for nearly 10 million gil, depending on your server!)</p>

<p id="eT9PJ7">That said, you should keep shuffling your stickers until you get your stickers lining up into this shape. After you have your seven stickers lined up in one of these orientations, you‚Äôll just need to pick a god and pray that your remaining two seals slot into where they‚Äôre supposed to go.</p>
<p id="3bMBjY">To make the most of your duties, Second Changes, and stickers, you should do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li id="86aIKo">Do as many of the duties as you can <strong>until you have seven stickers</strong>.

You can also check party finder for people looking for unsynced first-time clears of raids or trials.</li>
</ul>
<p id="MTZFgS">The rest is all just luck. There are tons of players who have been completing Wondrous Tails for years and haven‚Äôt gotten three lines, so don‚Äôt get discouraged.

Here‚Äôs what we learned.</p><h2 id="h20958"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> goes back to the source</strong></h2><p>Searcy tells us that The Coalition continued to work on <em>Gears 5</em> for well over a year after its 2019 launch, and that shaped their decision to pivot to <em>E-Day</em>. ‚ÄòWhen we finished all that stuff we were actually pretty far into the [covid] pandemic. So, a lot of people at the studio were saying we‚Äôre just gonna take a beat and reflect.‚Äù The natural progression might seem to be toward <em>Gears 6</em> (especially considering the cliffhanger at the end of <em>5</em>). But, the team instead found inspiration in an iconic, but relatively unmined, aspect of <em>Gears </em>lore: Emergence Day, or E-Day, when the bad-guy Locusts first emerged from underground on the planet Sera.</p><p>‚ÄúWe wanted to make something that really went to the heart of what people have in their heads when they play <em>Gears</em>,‚Äù Faucette said. ‚ÄúWe spent a lot of time listening to how fans talk about <em>Gears</em>.‚Äù The Coalition settled on four main pillars: the brutality inherent in this universe, the melancholic vibes (exemplified in the marketing both then and now, which loves to needle drop somber versions of  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúMad World‚Äù</a></span>), the brotherhood shared by the members of the COG army, and big, bold action sequences.</p><p>‚ÄúE-Day is where we landed [after discussing those franchise pillars],‚Äù Searcy said. ‚ÄúWe felt like we could get the most out of the theme, the vibe‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs the most important day in the entire franchise and there‚Äôs never been a game set there. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô story. What if monsters came out of the ground in Los Angeles?‚Äù</p><p>Faucette said that the team wants the Locust to feel scarier than they have in a while, especially the Drones, who have become a kind of cannon (and meme) fodder as the <em>Gears</em> series has progressed. We want to ‚Äúgo back to those horror vibes,‚Äù Faucette said. ‚Äú[We want the Locust to be] actually monsters that scare the shit out of you.‚Äù</p><h2 id="h20959"><a id=""></a><strong>Bros of war</strong></h2><p>Aside from the chainsaw gun, <em>Gears</em> <em>of War</em> is probably best known for its bond between Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago. The two hulking manly men have plenty of tender moments throughout the original trilogy, and Dom‚Äôs death at the end of <em>Gears of War 3</em> remains to this day one of the most emotional things I‚Äôve experienced in a game. <em>E-Day</em> takes place 14 years before the events of <em>Gears 1</em>, during a time in which Marcus and Dom aren‚Äôt yet the best bros.</p><p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the same Marcus and Dom that you know from the original trilogy,‚Äù Faucette said. Dom‚Äôs older brother recently died in the Pendulum War, and he and Marcus  were best friends, so there‚Äôs ‚Äútension, they‚Äôre struggling with grief and loss.‚Äù For The Coalition, <em>Gears of War E-Day</em> is an origin story of both Emergence Day but also of the bond that ‚Äúdefines the franchise.‚Äù</p><p>I love Marcus and Dom just as much as everyone else, but I still had a momentary pause after seeing the trailer. Until Anya (the Lieutenant in your ear in <em>Gears 1</em> and <em>Gears 2</em>) became a playable character in <em>Gears</em> <em>3</em>, the franchise always felt incredibly masculine‚Äîespecially if you played online like I did. With Kait Diaz becoming a central character in the second trilogy, it felt like the franchise was spreading its wings a bit more. Now, we‚Äôre back to the bros‚Äîduring a time of great strife in the industry where, perhaps, a female-focused <em>Gears</em> game would be met with derision from some bad actors.</p><p>I asked Faucette and Searcy about this, if <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> would feel like a bro-down session, a sort of backtracking, and they assured me it wouldn‚Äôt. They couldn‚Äôt tell me about them, but they promised there‚Äôd be other characters central to the story. ‚ÄúThose are just the two people in the trailer,‚Äù Faucette pointed out. ‚Äú<em>Gears</em> has always had a commitment of [showcasing] a wide array of humanity on this planet up against these monsters. That‚Äôs our studio values and our franchise values. We are 100% committed to unique and interesting characters in all walks of life.‚Äù</p><p>Here‚Äôs hoping I get to cut a Locust in half as a bad-ass bitch whenever <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> drops. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has unveiled Anno 117: Pax Romana, a new entry in Ubisoft Blue Byte's long-running economic city builder series, which is set to whisk PC and console players back to ancient Rome and the Roman Empire when it launches next year.
</p>
<p>
"It is the year 117 AD," Ubisoft explains, "as a Roman Governor of twin provinces of the Empire, your choices matter to your citizens. Build, trade, expand. Seize opportunities and harness the unique advantages and challenges that Albion and Latium provinces present."
</p>
<p>
"Will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance?," it continues. "Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? The cost of peace is yours to decide."

<p>
Details are limited at present, but the <a href="http://anno117paxromana.com/">Anno 117 website</a> makes mention of a "challenging narrative journey... where alternative paths beckon", and it'll all unfold across the the twin provinces under players' stewardship - those being the aforementioned Albion and Latium.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there're no screenshots and no gameplay footage to be scrutinised (although Ubisoft <em>has</em> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJNzvo3UJb8">live-action teaser trailer</a> to set the mood), so all we can do is await further information ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana's eventual arrival on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

            <p>For me, sandbox games are never better when there‚Äôs an inherent chaos about to erupt at any given second. In a literal sandbox that might be anything from a kid burying a freshly-laid turd like a mischievous cat ready to be stepped on by an unsuspecting trespasser, gathering handfuls of grit to lob in a another kids‚Äô eyes or swallowing a bunch of sand (hopefully turd-free) in pursuit of alchemising diamonds in their stomach. There don‚Äôt seem to be turds of any kind in upcoming sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Streets of Fortuna, but that‚Äôs about the only thing that this ambitious ‚Äúmegasim‚Äù appears to be missing in its sprawling go-anywhere, do-anything <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Streets of Fortuna sets the player loose into an original historical-ish city inspired by Constantinople around 500 AD. After that, it‚Äôs up to the player what they do - there‚Äôs no class or job system to speak of, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but you can improve in specific individual skills that might help you become, say, a blacksmith, or cook, or trader, or priest, or thief. Or instead of seeking a vocation or crafting goods, you could simply try to shag your way around the city or do whatever else you need to do to survive on the streets as a penniless nobody.</p>
<p>Reacting to your hijinks will be a procedurally-generated city full of a thousand individually simulated citizens and communities, whether they‚Äôre guards ready to chase you down if you‚Äôre caught nicking goods, potential customers to ply your wares - however legal - to, or targets for you to woo with romance or assassinate as you see fit. That might even include the city‚Äôs ruling Overlord, if you can find a way to try and take over the city yourself.</p>

<p>If a ridiculously detailed world created with procedural generation simulating the lives of hundreds of people sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>, there‚Äôs a good reason. Developer-publishers Kitfox Games previously brought Dwarf Fortress to Steam and Itch.io, and tapped up co-creator Tarn Adams at Bay 12 to help design, polish and playtest their own ambitious sim game.</p>
<p>Kitfox say the vibe is ‚Äúemergent chaos‚Äù and seeing stories play out as the world reacts to your various actions, which sounds like plenty for me to lose dozens of hours to given the plethora of possibilities seemingly on offer.</p>
<p>Revealed over the weekend during the PC Gaming Show, Streets of Fortuna has already been in development for two years, but Kitfox say there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlot‚Äù left to do before it‚Äôs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946850/Streets_of_Fortuna/">released on Steam</a> - with no release date yet. Beyond that, the devs have plans for regular updates on top of the basic framework to delve even deeper into elements of the fictional world, such as politics, going beyond the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù player experience of surviving on the streets as a thief.</p>

			<p>The latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> showcase just wrapped up, and while it was light on new game announcements, we did get a reveal of a new entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/anno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anno series</a>. While most entries in the Anno series have taken place in or around the European Age of Discovery, and there was even a couple set int the sci-fi future, the latest game in the series is going back much earlier in history. Anno 117: Pax Romana will put players in the sandals of an Ancient Roman governor, overseeing either a province in what‚Äôs now Italy or amongst the Celts in what‚Äôs now the United Kingdom. No gameplay of Anno 117 has been revealed, but Ubisoft did provide the following liver action teaser trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Live Action Teaser: Governors Wanted | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJNzvo3UJb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Obviously, I‚Äôd like some actual gameplay, but the concept of Anno 117: Pax Romana is certainly intriguing. Here‚Äôs some <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/ca/anno-117--pax-romana/6638e5dcaa201a2d55bcc772.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more official info about the game</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúAiming to be the biggest, most detailed Roman simulation to date, Anno 117: Pax Romana follows the Anno franchise's traditional emphasis on construction, not destruction. As governor, you'll be able to build up a province in Latium or the Celtic land of Albion as you see fit, managing everything from aqueducts to naumachia naval battles in your coliseum, and whether you spread Roman culture or adopt Celtic traditions will be up to you.‚Äù</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Become a Roman governor</strong> - You are a Roman Governor in the year 117 AD. Follow the path laid before you, or boldly question the status quo of the empire. Embark on a challenging narrative journey to build your cities where alternative paths beckon.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Discover Rome‚Äôs uncharted provinces</strong> - Journey through the little-known territories of the Roman Empire. Uncover the allure of Latium and Albion, the twin provinces under your stewardship as governor.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Build, Trade, Expand</strong> - Your choices as a governor matter to your citizens! Will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance? Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? Choose your path wisely, your decisions will guide them through the era of Pax Romana.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Amazon Luna sometime in 2025. What do you think? Ready to do as the Romans do?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175517/animal-crossing-aquarium-how-it-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pjLYK6">Fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/animal-crossing-new-horizons/40565"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a><em> </em>likely know the tedium and joy that comes with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/22759538/fish-locations-times-month-day-list-critterpedia">assembling an aquarium of their own</a> and fishing season after season, but the fun doesn‚Äôt have to stop in the game. Nintendo announced that the company will be bringing its <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> aquarium <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">tour nationwide on Monday</a>. The event started  with a partnership between Nintendo and the Seattle Aquarium that brought specially themed Animal Crossing exhibits to the aquarium. On Monday <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">Nintendo announced</a> that it would be expanding the event and tour several locations across the United States. </p>
<p id="5NPts9">The <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>Aquarium Tour will come to seven U.S. cities in total. It includes a nice spread of events across several regions. Here are all the locations and dates for each aquarium Nintendo has announced so far: </p>
<ul>
<li id="1u1PuC">Ripley‚Äôs Aquarium of Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ‚Äî June 14-Aug. 11</li>
<li id="N9mSUk">Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans, Louisiana ‚Äî June 21-Sept. 14</li>
<li id="6ZBaWo">Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia ‚Äî Aug. 1 - Sept. 26</li>
<li id="J6X9Cm">Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon ‚Äî Aug. 26-Oct. 20</li>
<li id="RUDV8d">New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts ‚Äî Sept. 21-Dec. 14</li>
<li id="ZChkFV">Sea Life Arizona in Tempe, Arizona ‚Äî Oct. 4-Nov. 17</li>
<li id="BDYJGN">Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee ‚Äî Dec. 21-Feb. 28</li>
</ul>
<p id="JN7SQR">The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/events/play-events/animal-crossing-aquarium-tour/">official FAQ on the event</a> describes the tour as an ‚Äúaquarium experience inspired by the <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> game.‚Äù The participating aquariums will host events ‚Äúand more with an Animal Crossing twist.‚Äù However if you want to get a stronger idea of what the official Animal Crossing aquarium experience could actually be like, it‚Äôs helpful to look at the aquarium tour hosted at the Seattle Aquarium. </p>
<p id="XTeBmW">A TikTok video from the user May showed what it was like to attend the event. The aquarium had giant Animal Crossing-themed backdrops to take photos. Visitors can look for cutouts of characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook in the aquarium, and get a card stamped as they find each character. Exhibits within the aquarium contain additional placards courtesy of Blathers, who will teach fans more about the fish they have caught in the game. Additionally, it looks like the event at the Seattle Aquarium contained adorable merch as well. If you want to see more, you can see the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mayplaystv/video/7327370544066612512">full video below</a>. </p>

<p id="HLcISP">Overall, it doesn‚Äôt look like anything overly fancy, but it doesn‚Äôt really need to be. The aquarium is already pretty dang fun ‚Äî even without Tom Nook there ‚Äî and it looks like the event could be the perfect excuse for an Animal Crossing fan to go and see some cool critters and fish. </p>

Ubisoft notes that while in the midst of missions, you won‚Äôt be able to switch between the two, though I‚Äôm still hoping a late-game set piece will require playing through an assassination as both. The gameplay trailer shows how killing the same assassination target can be approached from entirely different ways by the two, as each offer a unique style of play: Yasuke is a hulking, strong warrior and Naoe is a stealthy ninja.</p><p>The gameplay trailer begins with Yasuke wandering the countryside and happening upon a village. Immediately inhabitants of the village take notice of him due to his samurai status and his hulking figure‚Äîand the fact that he‚Äôs Black. Yasuke is a historical figure, the first Ubisoft has made a main protagonist in the series‚Äô 17-year history, and&nbsp;he‚Äôs basically a celebrity in this land. NPCs bow as Yasuke walks by and it serves as an interesting twist on how past games have typically forced protagonists into the seedier corners of society.</p><p>Yasuke‚Äôs combat style feels like the RPG-heavy entries in the<em> Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> series‚Äîthink along the lines of <em>Odyssey</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-kotaku-review-1845615415&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-the-kotaku-review-1845615415"><em>Valhalla</em></a></span>. We see Yasuke enter combat with skills available on the right trigger in tandem with face buttons. Yasuke can wield multiple weapons that players can swap between using the d-pad. During the trailer we see a polearm and a katana do some serious damage. </p><p> Yasuke is all impressive force and intense brutalities: his kanab≈ç can remove enemies‚Äô heads from their bodies, his strength allows him to impale them with his sword and lift them high up into the air. He can break down doors or thin walls by running through them. He‚Äôs a tank.&nbsp;</p><p>Naoe, however, plays like a mix of an original, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">stealthier <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed</em> </a></span>experience and a proper shinobi: she can use a grappling hook to reach faraway spots or to assassinate a mark, is more lithe and sneaky so that she can blend into the shadows, and has a few kunai she can throw from the safety of a high-up perch. Whereas Yasuke stormed through the front entrance of a castle and killed everyone in sight within minutes, Naoe gets in undiscovered, and silently assassin‚Äôs the men guarding her mark who is sulking in a beautiful courtyard. She uses a discarded reed to breath underwater, her entire body submerged just feet away from the target.&nbsp;</p><p>During the preview, Naoe and Yasuke both successfully assassinate the corrupt village leader in wildly different ways, but both times we‚Äôre treated to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21333631/ghost-of-tsushima-kurosawa-films-samurai-japan-abe-politics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurosawa-esque assassination animation</a></span>‚Äîcolor saps away until the scene is entirely in black and white, save for the bright red blood splatters that spurt off of his body.

Also, you can pet the dog. <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em> releases on November 15 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of the more interesting upcoming projects, alongside a whole slew of exciting-looking video games from the Xbox Games Showcase, was an action-adventure game called South of Midnight. It‚Äôll explore the mysteries of the Deep South, delving into folklore and ancient powers. But do we know the South of Midnight release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-south-of-midnight-coming-out">When is South of Midnight Coming Out?</h2>



<p>While the South of Midnight gameplay trailer gave us an in-depth look at how the game mechanics play out, it didn‚Äôt reveal much about the release. As such, we know South of Midnight is coming out sometime in 2025, but that‚Äôs about all we know. The trailer didn‚Äôt offer a better release window, and there are currently no leaks surrounding the date.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre definitely keeping an eye on this, however. The moment we know more about the game‚Äôs release date or even a better release window, we‚Äôll update this piece to ensure you know!</p>

<h2 id="h-is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-game-pass">Is South of Midnight Coming to Game Pass?</h2>



<p>Thanks to the gameplay trailer shown above, we know that South of Midnight will launch on the following platforms:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>



<li><strong>Game Pass</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Whether it launches simultaneously with PC and Xbox Series X|S, however, remains to be seen. It seems more than likely, considering Xbox‚Äôs recent approach to day-one releases on its subscription platform!</p>

<p>Following an incredible showing during the Xbox Games Showcase, we now know a bit more about the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta. More specifically, we saw plenty of story details and gameplay. But do we know the Metal Gear Solid Delta release date?</p>







<p>Based on the Metal Gear Solid Delta trailer we saw recently, we know the stealth-action remake is coming sometime in 2025. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt yet have a precise release date, but considering the quality of what we saw at the showcase, we imagine it‚Äôll be sometime in early 2025.</p>



<p>Of course, that‚Äôs not a guarantee. It might wind up being summer or even fall, so we‚Äôll have to wait for more information.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Œî: SNAKE EATER - Official Trailer #1 - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTVaEPHa9Bc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta is a full-blown remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater from 2004. It features a modern control scheme, all-new graphics, and better audio. At the same time, it will retain the storyline and world we know and love!</p>











<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks that we previously reported on</a>, we have a good indication as to the total cost of Metal Gear Solid Delta. Supposedly, the stealth-action game is priced at:</p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater ‚Äì Standard Edition
<ul>
<li>$69.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater ‚Äì Collector‚Äôs Edition
<ul>
<li>$199.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>It‚Äôs unclear precisely what the collector‚Äôs edition includes, but we imagine it‚Äôll include many fun physical items. At that price, we may even end up with a Snake statue!</p>

Activision has published a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions" rel="nofollow ">massive blog</a> on the official Call of Duty site to explain how it all works, but we've boiled it down for you in a few sentences below.</p><p dir="ltr">Basically, Game Pass subscribers will be able to access Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at launch on October 25 if they are actively subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console. As you might expect, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access to both the PC and Xbox versions of the game, as well as Multiplayer and Zombies modes on both platforms. However, those with a Game Pass Console subscription must also have a Game Pass Core pass in order to play Black Ops 6's online modes like Zombies, as well as general multiplayer. Subscribers can further upgrade to the game's Vault Edition (MSRP of $30 US) to receive benefits like a Mastercraft Weapon Collection and the Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack.</p><p dir="ltr">To access preorder bonuses like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Open Beta Early Access</a> and the Woods Operator Pack, Game Pass subscribers must log in to Modern Warfare 3 or Warzone on the platform where they hold their subscription at some point before October 25. It's not clear when this open beta will take place, but subscribers should look out for concrete dates at some point soon. Additionally, if you unsubscribe to Game Pass, you naturally lose access to Black Ops 6 unless you resub or buy it outright.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news revealed at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, we recently learned that Black Ops 6 will require all players to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-will-require-players-to-be-online-across-all-modes-including-campaign/1100-6524100/">continuous internet collection</a> to enjoy the game, including the campaign.</p>

		<p>The Crew Motorfest‚Äôs second year will be kicking off with two major additions to the game. The first will be the addition of Maui island to the game, which will be 100 square kilometers, adding a whole new location for players to explore. The other addition is the premium PvE called The Chase Squad.</p>

<p>Ubisoft have also given some detail about The Chase Squad, saying <em>‚ÄúMaui will also be among the settings for The Chase Squad, in which players will join with an elite team of drivers who want to shake up conventional ideas about racing as they take down rival drivers. The Chase Squad will challenge players to track, outsmart, and outmaneuver racing rivals in high-speed nighttime pursuits across the islands. Season 5 will also bring more of the Made in Japan playlist, with new races, events, and locations.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft will be hosting a The Crew Showcase this September, where more details about Made in Japan Volume 2 and The Chase Squad will be given.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/you-gotta-be-kitten-me-coming-to-target<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stone Blade Entertainment has announced the retail release of one of their board games. The tabletop studio is beloved for its assembly of world-class tabletop designers and developers.

Another year, another Ubisoft Forward livestream without any reference to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, the long, long-awaited sci-fi sequel that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-ubisoft-insists">Ubisoft still says it has in the works</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">BGE&amp;E2 overtook Duke Nukem Forever as the game with the longest-ever development period</a>, back in 2022. 18 months later, we've heard little since. 
</p>
<p>
In January 2023, Ubisoft told Eurogamer that "Beyond Good and Evil 2's development is under way and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise."
</p>

<p>
But its development has been hit by numerous setbacks, including the departure of Ubisoft veteran Michel Ancel in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
In 2023, its developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-studio-reportedly-under-investigation-for-unprecedented-burnout-and-sick-leave">Ubisoft Montpellier was the subject of a labour investigation into "unprecedented" levels of employee stress and sickness</a>, and the departure of its managing director.
</p>
<p>
While it's been ages since we've had a proper update on the long-in-development project, fans had really hoped for some kind of update this year, after Ubisoft previously said a new version of the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil would launch in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is yet to comment further on the frankly bizarre situation with its still officially unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-now-playing-ubisofts-still-unannounced-beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> that some fans were able to play last year "due to a technical error".
</p>
<p>
That project was "set for early 2024", Ubisoft told Eurogamer in November last year. It's perhaps unecessary to state that it's no longer early 2024 and no longer Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th anniversary year either.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-it%E2%80%99s-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024.897417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed was <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> with a new story trailer at yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase 2024, and an Obsidian blog post briefly <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-release-date-revealed-by-obsidians-game-director-but-quickly-gets-pulled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a November 12 release date before being corrected.</p>
<p>However, the real meat in terms of new info came today via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfEdLugnpuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest special episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, which hosted Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel. She brought some new footage (though unfortunately it is only available in Full HD) and revealed plenty of new information, starting with the fact that the game will indeed feature a third-person camera option, in stark contrast to all the footage released so far. That will certainly be welcome news for all those players who can't stand first-person view due to motion sickness issues.</p>
<p>Patel also demonstrated how Obsidian aims to make it very clear for players when one of their equipped weapons is ineffective due to its lack of upgrades. Besides just not doing enough damage, you'll also get very obvious visual and sound cues that you need to gather enough resources to enhance the weapon.</p>
<p>The footage then showed some pretty nighttime (Avowed features dynamic time of day) scenes and a glimpse into the party camp, which is where the player character and their companions will rest, recuperate, and most importantly chat about what's happened.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive | Avowed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bfEdLugnpuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, we got another look at the character progression. On certain level milestones, players will get to increase their attribute points: Might increases damage and carry weight, Constitution increases health and poison/bleed resistance, Dexterity improves attack and action speed, Perception increases critical hit chance and max range, Intellect augments Essence and elemental resistance, and Resolve increases stamina and reduces the cooldown of Second Wind.</p>
<p>On every level up, the character will gain one ability point to spend on skill in the Fighter, Ranger, Wizard, and Godlike trees. Avowed is classless, so you can freely choose to spend everything in the Wizard (or any other tree) or just make a jack-of-all-trades character. Some of the skills will also be helpful in traversal, such as Fan of Flames making quick work of the brambles that blocked a certain path. A respec option is available for those who may regret spending points in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Throughout the podcast, Obsidian provided a look at how to resolve a quest in two opposite ways. The player character needs to acquire the heart from an ancient forest creature, and the user can opt to slay her brethren (which will lead to a confrontation once the creature realizes you've killed them all) or use stealth to avoid the guards and obtain the item with a diplomatic approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview with Eurogamer</a>, Carrie Patel also expressed confidence in the studio's ability to release Avowed this year.</p>
<p><em>I'll say, just having come from the studio last week, the game is looking fantastic. The team is putting a lot of love into the polish. So we feel very good about 2024.</em></p>
<p>It also may be the case that Obsidian and Microsoft are waiting to see the release window of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which may be revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tomorrow</a> alongside the first look at gameplay. After all, they're both fantasy action RPGs likely headed toward a November launch.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Avowed will be available for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and it'll be on Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-13-minutes-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has released 13 minutes of extended <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, showing off the game's updated stealth mechanics, exploration, environments, and more.</p>
<p>The new footage was released during the publisher's Ubisoft Forward event. In addition to the extended gameplay footage, Game Director Charles Benoit and Art Director Thierry Dansereau also presented a deep dive into the game's combat and stealth. "The Gameplay Walkthrough mission shown at the conference takes place in the castle town of Fukuchiyama in Tamba Province, where Naoe and Yasuke are hunting down a corrupted daimyo", the press release from Ubisoft reads. "The gameplay illustrates the complementary dynamic between the two playable heroes: Naoe,<br>
the agile and stealthy Shinobi, and Yasuke, the combat-focused Samurai."</p>
<p>Both new videos have been included below. We've also included some additional info about the gameplay walkthrough mission, as provided by Ubisoft.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Official Gameplay - Combat and Stealth Evolved | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2crLch9Mb8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li>Naoe embodies the essence of a Shinobi Assassin. From a versatile grappling hook that<br>
allows for stealthy in-air assassinations and greater mobility, to kunai and her custom<br>
Hidden Blade for swift eliminations, she has access to a diverse arsenal of tools to strike<br>
from the shadows. While more vulnerable in close combat, she can skillfully deflect,<br>
dodge enemy strikes, and retaliate with lethal precision, using light, her surroundings,<br>
and structures around her to topple her foes.</li>
<li>Yasuke is tailored for direct confrontations, relying on his exceptional combat skills and<br>
mastery of Samurai weaponry. Whether wielding the Katana for decisive strikes, opting<br>
for raw power with the Kanabo, or engaging opponents from a distance with lethal flint<br>
rifle called Teppo, he can handle multiple enemies at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Amazon Luna, and Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store on November 15, 2024. The game is also coming to iPad later on.</p>

  <p id="PliY6h">Ubisoft‚Äôs big games showcase, Ubisoft Forward, kept the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164106/summer-game-fest-2024">Summer Game Fest</a> hype train rolling on Monday with fresh details on new and upcoming games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em>, <em>XDefiant</em>, and a plethora of Prince of Persia projects ‚Äî including the long-awaited return (sort of) of Ubi‚Äôs <em>Sands of Time</em> remake.</p>
<p id="MoEbYa">Here‚Äôs everything that Ubisoft had to share during Ubisoft Forward 2024.</p>

<p id="rpewAR">Star Wars fans will live out their bounty hunter fantasies this summer in a brand-new open-world galactic adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175099/star-wars-outlaws-preview-impressions-stealth-gameplay"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>. At Ubisoft Forward, developers from Massive Entertainment walked players through what they can expect from scrappy scoundrel Kay Vess‚Äô adventure. She‚Äôll wrangle criminal cartels, engage in battles both in space and on planet Tatooine, and travel to locations familiar and new in the Star Wars galaxy. The 10-minute gameplay showcase was full of gameplay variety and plenty of blaster fire to get players hyped for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‚Äô Aug. 30 release date.</p>
<div id="xpUxoj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kwo41nUwyeo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zDAtw0">Not content to release just <em>one</em> new trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, Ubisoft released a second game overview trailer that highlights the title‚Äôs diversity of locations, alien species, and gameplay styles. </p>
<h2 id="BcJsPa"><strong>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</strong></h2>
<div id="eknQsQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="lxI4uO">Ubisoft is taking the Assassin‚Äôs Creed series to Japan for the first time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em></a>. Players will be able to take on dual roles as either the stealthy shinobi Naoe or the powerhouse samurai Yasuke. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a deep dive into how those protagonists will play in a 13-minute gameplay walkthrough. <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em> is out on Nov. 15.</p>
<h2 id="6WIGNG"><strong>Prince of Persia</strong></h2>
<p id="JZ3SLD">Ubisoft came with not one, not two, but three Prince of Persia-related announcements for the franchise‚Äôs 35th anniversary. Here‚Äôs what it showed at Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<div id="pARfML"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ke-pi068EXg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="deFzBr"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> will get a free content update with revised bosses, puzzle challenges, new amulets, new outfits, and more. There‚Äôs also story DLC coming in the form of <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown: Mask of Darkness</em> this September.</p>
<div id="rOzyOr"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZcC8TPRCpU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="bLpcl9">Evil Empire and Ubisoft also have an update coming for roguelite platformer <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia.</em> It‚Äôs called the Temple of Fire and it will bring even tougher challenges to the early access game.</p>
<div id="YutHBk"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="2CWWYg">But that‚Äôs not all. Ubisoft even brought out a trailer for its long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake and... you‚Äôre going to have to wait a lot longer. Ubisoft announced a 2026 release window for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">the troubled game</a>.</p>

<p id="mmWphI">Ubisoft‚Äôs free-to-play shooter, <em>XDefiant</em>, is getting its first season. That debut season will include new maps, a new Capture the Flag mode, new weapons, and a new faction: GSK from the Rainbow Six series. <em>XDefiant</em> season 1 launches July 2.</p>

<p id="SZmmr2"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em>, the next entry in Ubisoft and Blue Byte‚Äôs 25-year-old economic sim real-time strategy game, is coming in 2025, letting players take on the role of Roman governor overseeing their growing empire. At Ubisoft Forward, we got a pretty silly live-action trailer that highlights the challenge of governing an ancient province when your most loyal subjects are goats. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Deadly stealth and brute force working in tandem.</h2></div><section><p>16th-century Japan is ripe with fascinating historical context for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-assassins-creed-games">Assassin‚Äôs Creed game</a> to thrive, which is one aspect that makes the upcoming Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows so enticing. The way the series bends history for its fiction has me hyped to see its version of feudal Japan, but it‚Äôs also a setting that lends itself well to the kind of combat options that have been encompassed by the entire franchise.</p><p>In a hands-off preview demo of Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows, I was able to see roughly 30 minutes of gameplay that showcased both Naoe and Yasuke ‚Äì the two protagonists ‚Äì and their combat styles in action. They represent both worlds of the series‚Äô combat: Naoe, a stealthy shinobi wielding the iconic Hidden Blade, and Yasuke, a force of nature with pure power and masterful swordsmanship. </p><p>At the start of the demo, I saw Yasuke pulling up to a town where everyday people are squeezing out an existence under the boot of a corrupt shogunate that enforces a caste system. It‚Äôs a common dynamic in stories set in this era of Japan, but it‚Äôs also ripe for Yasuke to do right by the people who revere him. He has a commanding, respected presence, and the first combat encounter was against a group of samurai who were harassing a villager that shows off Yasuke‚Äôs swordsmanship. The challenge is to dodge or counter enemy attacks (indicated by blue and red glints on their blade) in traditional melee combat. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/ac-shadows-1718037568488.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows doesn‚Äôt hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat. Yasuke has finishing moves where he either slices enemies‚Äô heads off clean or stabs them in the gut before lifting them up just to slam them back down. These finishers are also highlighted with black-and-white frame cuts with blood splattering, giving it a bit of the samurai cinematic flair. What‚Äôs just as brutal is Yasuke‚Äôs spiked club, which is a heavy blunt-force weapon that pounds armored foes. Seeing them take a swing straight to the dome brought a little, ‚ÄúOooooh!‚Äù out of me. The point being that Yasuke is purely focused on melee, so while he won‚Äôt be doing a lot of climbing rooftops and jumping between buildings, he‚Äôll hold it down by taking all his enemies head on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows doesn‚Äôt hold back when it comes to the brutality of its combat.</p></div><p>After this introductory combat encounter, a cutscene shows Naoe burst onto the scene to help Yasuke by leaping onto an enemy and executing them with her Hidden Blade. Naoe and Yasuke have this sort of chummy dynamic as they decide how to take on their next mission: assassinate the daimyo at Fukuchiyama Castle. From here, you have to choose to either control Naoe or Yasuke, and this will determine your playstyle and how you navigate the mission to kill your target.</p><p>Playing as Naoe, you then have access to scaling walls, hiding in foliage, and stealthy kills. She‚Äôs not solely working with a Hidden Blade either; she has throwable kunai for ranged kills and a set of short swords to get her hands dirty up close and personal, should things go loud. But my favorite weapon of hers is the chained blade she can swing around in a circle to chop down crowds of enemies, which even slices through environmental objects. So while she is more focused on being nimble and staying out of sight, she still has some viable options as backup.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/acs3-1718037606123.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But of course, slipping past guards to nab those satisfying stealth kills seems to be worth the effort. Being able to move through the environment with tools like a grappling hook to get up on higher ground in a jiffy and assassinate unsuspecting guards almost reminded me of Tenchu, since it‚Äôs more about smartly using tools than just hiding in grass and waiting for patrol patterns to play out. Naoe channels traditional Assassin‚Äôs Creed energy, and her options definitely lean into the Splinter Cell fantasy that hasn‚Äôt really been fulfilled in the years since we last saw Sam Fisher in action.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Naoe channels traditional Assassin‚Äôs Creed energy.</p></div><p>If you play this same mission as Yasuke, you literally bust down the front door and provoke all enemies into combat. Watching him tear through guards almost reminded me of For Honor, another Ubisoft game, for how methodical it all seemed to play, even though it isn‚Äôt quite that in depth of swordfighting. Since this is the era of Japanese history that first introduced firearms via Western import, Yasuke also wields a single-shot rifle, and it's pretty wild to see a hulking samurai pull off headshots just before whipping out his katana to slice down the rest of the foes in front of him.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/screenshot-2024-06-10-093248-1718037644299.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whether you play as Naoe or Yasuke, the end result seems to be the same: you kill the daimyo and keep it moving. I‚Äôm not sure what the story implications will be depending on your choice, if any. But it‚Äôs nice to see two characters with fully realized playstyles with a number of weapons and tools so as to not get stuck into monotonous combat encounters. Granted, that will be determined by how quests are designed. Infiltrating Fukuchiyama Castle showed promise in this regard, but I would love to see if, or how, Shadows can mix and match the two protagonists in more natural ways.</p><p>I‚Äôm more curious now to get my own hands on Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows because I always appreciate how different weapons and gear create a distinct flow, especially for a series that‚Äôs recently been bouncing between different identities. For me, the most interesting aspects of this game will come from the creative freedom Ubisoft flexes when playing with its historical fiction. Yasuke is a fascinating figure in Japanese history and having a covert shinobi in Naoe contrast the ideals of highly regarded samurai sets my expectations quite high. At least now, I know I‚Äôll be getting a more interesting gameplay dynamic than what I‚Äôve seen from Assassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äôs recent past.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Assassin's Creed: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>From 2007's debut title to the upcoming console, PC, mobile, and VR projects, here is the entire Assassin's Creed series in one list.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-may-fulfill-that-galactic-scoundrel-fantasy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Uncharted territory for Star Wars.</h2></div><section><p>Some of the more interesting Star Wars content in recent years has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/andor-season-1-review">nothing to do with Jedi and Sith.</a> While their iconic push-and-pull of good versus evil has been a great framework for games like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars Jedi</a> series, honing in on the life of a scoundrel gives us the opportunity to see life in the galaxy from a different perspective. That‚Äôs the impression I got after getting hands-on with an hour's worth of gameplay with Star Wars Outlaws, the upcoming third-person action shooter from Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment.</p><p>It‚Äôs rough around the edges as of however old this build was, but exploring the galaxy as protagonist Kay Vess and getting into dirty business in this three-part demo was refreshing, even though a lot of its gameplay felt familiar. The best representation of this was a mission that started inside an Imperial base and sent me to sneak my way around to activate controls to move a cargo shipment, opening the way to steal a ship for a getaway. After knocking out some guards and hacking into some systems, I got into a shootout with Stormtroopers as I waited for the cargo to move into the ship I was going to steal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-trailblazer-combat-nologo-1718038781813.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kay isn‚Äôt exactly a force of nature and has to get scrappy, which meant well-placed shots, using cover, and commanding her little merqaal companion, Nix, to lend a hand were required to make it out alive. Kay‚Äôs blaster has a lethal and EMP-style modes, plus a one-shot knockout on cooldown, but she can also pick up enemy weapons for more firepower. Putting this all together was pretty challenging, but after making the escape I was then in control of an Imperial ship and getting into dogfights in space, channeling some of that Star Wars Squadrons energy into Outlaws. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of this happened seamlessly, moving from one thing to another at a brisk pace.</p></div><p>I then returned to the desert planet Toshara in the city of Mirogana, where the criminal underworld thrives, for the finale of this story mission. All of this happened seamlessly, moving from one thing to another at a brisk pace and encompassing all the aspects of what it takes to be a successful scoundrel in the Star Wars universe. Although I didn‚Äôt get to spend much time poking around Mirogana, it seems to be full of side content to give Outlaws that open-world feel to complement the linear story-based missions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-reactor-grapple-nologo-1718038781815.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I do think Outlaws sometimes relies too heavily on the design conventions of an Uncharted or Tomb Raider. For instance, another part of the demo had me platforming and climbing structures to retrieve a relic tucked away deep in this abandoned reactor. It seemed like every other room had the ground falling under me in an attempt to create tension, but we‚Äôve seen this rug-pull trick far too many times for it to be a surprise. And the controls aren‚Äôt quite precise enough to make jumping gaps, scaling walls, or shimmying across ledges feel natural ‚Äì this is something action-adventure games of this kind have figured out in years past so it‚Äôs a bit disappointing that Star Wars Outlaws struggles here. Hopefully that's on the fix-it list for the last few months before launch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Especially when you‚Äôre in the middle of a hostile encounter, minigames add a neat wrinkle.</p></div><p>The third segment of the demo had me infiltrating a base run by thieves on the dark and snowy planet Kijimi, and this had an emphasis on stealth and hacking mechanics. Although staying out of sight is all you really need to do, I wish the stealth mechanics were more robust. Kay struggles to stick to cover and Nix isn‚Äôt super helpful as a companion in this scenario, but once everything breaks into a shootout all of that becomes a moot point. The hacking minigames became more prominent, and I actually quite enjoy the rhythm-based lockpicking and the Wordle-style icon-matching one, which are clever little breaks in the traditional action. Especially when you‚Äôre in the middle of a hostile encounter frantically trying to hack into systems or past doors, these add a neat wrinkle to round out the gameplay flow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/swo-ubifw-wellspring-nologo-1718038781814.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>I wasn‚Äôt able to get the full context for the story happening in this mission, but Kijimi is a fascinating and more recent planet in the Star Wars universe that‚Äôs also deep with crime syndicates. Seeing Kay tip-toe around allegiances and get into sticky situations with competing factions makes me excited to see how Star Wars Outlaws presents that scoundrel fantasy. It‚Äôs like having a fully realized game based around the idea of being Han Solo, but having a new character in Kay Vess gives it room to breathe and create a new fiction within Star Wars, divorced from the canon or expectations that often puts pressure on the franchise.</p><p>So at this stage I can say that Star Wars Outlaws shows a lot of promise, but as usual we'll have to wait and see how many of the things that struck me as a little off can be smoothed out ahead of launch. (Never tell me the odds!) Even though it‚Äôs borrowing a lot from what we‚Äôve seen in games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider, the Star Wars universe is ripe for that style of game. More stories outside of the Jedi-Sith framework are also appreciated, especially ones that dig deeper into the criminal underworld and the implications it has on the rest of the Star Wars world. Gameplay may not be as fluid or satisfying as the games that it‚Äôll be compared to, or even the Star Wars Jedi series, but there‚Äôs a good variety of mechanics and systems that meld really well.</p><p>Hopefully it all comes together in the full game, which we won't have to wait for very long for: Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 27 of this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Plus, Ubisoft revealed Anno 117: Pax Romana and told us the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is coming in 2026. Read on to learn about everything that happened during the event.</p><h2>New Star Wars Outlaws Gameplay Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft kicked off the show with new gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws, showcasing gameplay across multiple systems in the galaxy. We got a great look at Outlaws' infamous hive of scum and villainy, which will feature corrupt officials and merchants to interact with. We also saw space combat, as Kay got into an optional dogfight that helped improve her standing with the Pyke Syndicate.  From there, the gameplay went to Tatooine, where we saw Mos Eisley Cantina, Kay traversing the desert on her speeder, and an infiltration mission where Kay tracked down an old gunslinger who can teach her a valuable skill. Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-may-fulfill-that-galactic-scoundrel-fantasy">Star Wars Outlaws preview</a> to learn how the game may fulfill the galactic scoundrel fantasy.</p><h2>Star Wars Outlaws Overview Trailer</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After the gameplay demo, Ubisoft shared an overview trailer for Star Wars Outlaws, showcasing the cooperative dynamic between Kay and her companion Nix. We also got a look at the reputation system, where Kay can get unwanted attention from criminal syndicates depending on how she handles certain missions. </p><h2>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake Is Coming in 2026</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake has been in development for a very long time now, and today Ubisoft revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-set-for-2026">it's coming in 2026</a>. No footage was shown, but we do finally have at least a release window for the long-awaited remake.</p><h2>Assassin's Creed Shadows Gameplay Deep Dive</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We got a big look at Assassin's Creed Shadows, showing off the nature of the game's dual protagonist structure. In one instance, players were able to choose to play as Yasuke or Naoe to tackle a mission in one of two ways: The Samurai Yasuke wanted to rush through the front gates, while the Shinobi Naoe wanted to sneak along the rooftops. The gameplay footage showed us Naoe's path, as she snuck around castle grounds after nightfall. Check out our new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists">preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to learn more.</p><h2>Anno 117: Pax Romana Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft announced the next entry in city-builder series Anno. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-finally-brings-the-city-builder-franchise-to-the-ancient-roman-empire-ubisoft-forward-2024">Titled Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, the new entry is taking the series to the long-requested setting of the Ancient Roman Empire. It's coming to PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 sometime next year.</p><h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown DLC Revealed</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A handful of updates are coming to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, including a free content update available now that includes new outfits, amulets, and platforming challenges called the Divine Trials. Then, Ubisoft teased story DLC titled Mask of Darkness, which is coming this September. Additionally, The Rouge Prince of Persia: The Temple of Fire update is adding new content to the roguelite take on the franchise that hit early access earlier this year.</p><h2>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Is Coming Next Month</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We got a trailer for The Sky Breaker, the next big story DLC coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. It's launching as part of the game's season pass on July 16.</p><h2>XDefiant Season 1 Starts Next Month</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft shared an update on XDefiant, revealing that Season 1 will begin on July 2. XDefiant is in its preseason right now, and the full Season 1 launch will add a ton of new features, including Capture the Flag, a new ranked progression system, three free new weapons, and one new map per month. We saw new maps called Daytona and Clubhouse which will join the XDefiant map rotation soon. A full reveal of Season 1 is coming on July 1.</p><h2>Skull and Bones Update</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Skull and Bones Season 2: Chorus of Havoc is underway, and we learned what the season will bring, including a Megalodon to face off against, a new maneuverable ship called The Brig, and time limited boat race events. Fleet management is on the way, too, which has been a requested feature from the community.

Game Director Carrie Patel touched on these details during the interview, but the feature that might have fans the most excited is the promise that you will have the option to play in both first and third person.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/third-person-in-avowed-1718044506084.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>AVOWED HAS A THIRD-PERSON MODE.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Other details touched on in the presentation include a few colorful conversations with NPCs like Yatzli and Kai. Patel also teases some of the ways the environment will change as Avowed goes from day to night, as well as the ways different NPCs will react to your character‚Äôs Godlike status.</p><p>Like other RPGs, Avowed has a selection of skills to allow players to choose how they approach encounters, and yes, you'll be able to respec your trees if you eventually decide you don't like the path you've set yourself on. We see one scenario that is handled two different ways: with combat and with stealth. Using combat to reach an important NPC could anger them, blocking the player off from certain dialogue options and potentially useful rewards. Trying stealth with the Shadowing Beyond ability, which essentially turns the player invisible, results in this same NPC allowing the player to leave with what they came for in peace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Those who try stealth in Avowed should note that enemies have a ‚Äúshout radius,‚Äù meaning you might be able to get away with dispatching a single enemy if they‚Äôre far enough away from their friends. Some of the enemies that players will be sneaking past or slashing through include tiny, blue-and-orange mushroom creatures. These odd beings come in different groups, with some able to attack from a distance while the other swarm with melee attacks.</p><p>Avowed‚Äôs deep-dive presentation follows its appearance at the Xbox Games Showcase yesterday, where Obsidian showed off additional gameplay, story details, and more from its vibrant fantasy world. It was a showing for the first- and third-person project that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidians-avowed-gets-new-story-trailer-still-no-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2024"><u>came and went without revealing a release date</u></a>.

The date is now nowhere to be found, suggesting that Obsidian wasn‚Äôt quite ready to commit to that schedule just yet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Avowed Xbox Showcase 2024 Screnshots</h3></div></output><p>Avowed is officially only set to release before the end of 2024.

    <p><span>Massive Entertainment-developed Star Wars adventure due out on August 30.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,267 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Massive Entertainment [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft/massive-entertainment">Massive Entertainment</a> have released a 10-minute gameplay showcase, a game overview trailer, and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Star Wars Outlaws [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a></em>. <span id="more-891438"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>A new gameplay showcase video for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> debuted at Ubisoft Forward, following emerging scoundrel Kay Vess on a mission to Tatooine to find an expert gunslinger and convince them to help her upgrade her skills with a blaster. In addition, a game overview trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> premiered, providing a look into Kay and Nix‚Äôs past, the high-risk jobs they can take on, and the distinct locations they can explore in the <a title="Genres > Open-World [430 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p><p><strong>New Gameplay Showcase</strong></p><p>In the new gameplay video, game director Mathias Karlson breaks down one of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‚Äò expert quests.</p><p>‚ÄúOne of your motivations for exploration is to find elusive experts scattered across the galaxy who will help Kay pick up new skills to survive in the underworld,‚Äù Karlson explains.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the video, Kay gathers intel about a gunslinger on Tatooine. As she travels through space from the asteroid field in Akiva‚Äôs orbit on her ship, the Trailblazer, we see her come to the aid of a Pyke Syndicate freighter under attack by pirate starfighters; the Pykes are grateful for her assistance, and Kay‚Äôs reputation with the syndicate grows and may open up further opportunities with them in the future.</p><p>Once on Tatooine, Kay enters a planet where most of the economy is under the control of a different syndicate: the Hutt Cartel. She explores Mos Eisley, the legendary hive of scum and villainy, in search of the gunslinger. Karlson says creating Mos Eisley was a highlight for the development team: ‚ÄúRecreating this iconic city is a dream come true for our team, allowing us to show parts of Mos Eisley you‚Äôve never seen before.‚Äù</p><p>Kay‚Äôs intel leads to a Hutt Cartel storehouse located in the southern hills; unfortunately, she has a poor reputation with the Hutts. They won‚Äôt simply let her through the front door‚Äîshe‚Äôll need to infiltrate the area without triggering the alarm or risk getting into a confrontation. Kay succeeds and finds information on the location of the gunslinger, but now she needs to make her escape, leading her into a shootout before fleeing the scene. At the end of the video, Kay finally meets with the expert gunslinger, Sherriff Quint.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_891436"><ul><li><span>‚ùÆ</span></li><li><span>‚ùØ</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Game Overview Trailer</strong></p><p>The latest trailer for <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> details what makes Kay an original scoundrel, the underworld setting, and the galaxy of opportunity that awaits. Kay takes on high-risk, high-reward jobs to earn favor with the galaxy‚Äôs most notorious crime syndicates, including the cutthroat Pyke Syndicate, the crafty and cunning Crimson Dawn, amongst others. More of the locations Kay will explore are shown in detail in the video above, including the jungle world of Akiva, the ancient city of Kijimi, and the savannah moon of Toshara. There are flashbacks to Kay‚Äôs past growing up in Canto Bight, a memory of meeting Nix for the first time, and scenes of Kay hustling and thieving to survive</p></blockquote><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,280 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,568 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Store</a> on August 30.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

<p data-characters="423" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I recently took a look at three different missions from developer Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft‚Äôs upcoming open-world adventure title <em>Stars</em> <em>Wars Outlaws</em>. It feels like <em>Star Wars</em> is getting a ton of game releases lately, which while good as a whole, has also led to a few missing the mark. Thankfully, it looks like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is staying true to the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and I‚Äôm excited to explore it.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Gameplay Showcase | Ubisoft Forward" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_O1eqWWbe4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, players will adventure to various planets in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, each one with unique gameplay elements and environments to explore. Throughout the three missions I saw many elements that have become staples all things <em>Star Wars</em> front and center in <em>Outlaws</em>. From zipping across the desert-like planet of Tatooine on a speeder to walking around a bustling cantina trying to get a meeting with a Hutt cartel.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">In one mission, players engage in a dogfight in space while piloting a ship called the Trailblazer with the nearby planet looming in the background. The space combat seemed very similar to that of <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em>, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. Dodging asteroids and space debris while flying around and dealing with enemies is always a good time, and it looks like the systems for doing so are a big part of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> rather than just an added sub-feature.</p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">An important aspect of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is going to be the story. The premise is solid, but I‚Äôm still looking forward to the opportunity to dive into the massive open-world and explore the side quests and off-the-beaten path areas of <em>Outlaws</em>. But after seeing a few gameplay missions, it looks as though Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft are going in the right direction with the world design and level of immersion that very important to a <em>Star Wars</em> game.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is set to release on August 30 on PC Ubisoft+ Premium, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Avowed</em>, the next RPG from those famed RPG creators at Obsidian, got another trailer during the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Xbox Games Showcase</a> this weekend. The new footage confirmed it‚Äôs coming this year, but <em>Avowed </em>had a full release date revealed elsewhere before it was quickly removed.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1799950878432256254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Wario64 on X</a>, the <em>Avowed </em><a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer blog page</a> on the official Obsidian site revealed a release date of November 12, 2024.

 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">The date came as part of a short quote provided by the game director, Carrie Patel.

 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">For the most part, Obsidian is still targeting 2024 for <em>Avowed</em>.

		<p>Ubisoft have revealed how<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows </a>will play in a new video released as part of Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin‚Äôs order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities ‚Äì Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we‚Äôve seen on occasion through the Assassin‚Äôs Creed series.</p>
<p>The game will have a full year cycle that will change the weather and give you different things to do depending on the season.&nbsp; Most importantly, you can also pet the doggos!</p>

<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game. The Ultimate Pack will contain the Sekiryu Character Pack (Naoe and Yasuke outfit and weapon, trinket and mount), the Sekiryu Hideout Pack, 5 Skill points and a Red and black photo mode filter.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector‚Äôs Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack, physical content and 3 days early access to the game. The physical content will be a Steelbook, the World map, Naoe &amp; Yasuke Figurine, life-size Naoe‚Äôs Katana Tsuba, a Wall Creed Scroll, an 84 pages collector‚Äôs artbook and 2 sumi-e lithographs.</li>
