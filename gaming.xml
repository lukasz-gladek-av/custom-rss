			<p>With the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft movie</a>, Microsoft's head of gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-would-rather-revisit-owned-ips-than-rely-on-more-licensed-games/">Phil Spencer</a>, took an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> to discuss how Microsoft and Xbox feel about navigating the future of its adaptations.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Spencer also commented quickly on what Xbox has lined up for the rest of 2025. He avoided accidentally leaking anything, but he does confirm that there are more unannounced titles beyond what Xbox has already officially announced. Along with what we do know, Spencer feels "<em>great</em>" about Xbox's 2025 lineup.</p>
<p>"<em>For us and the rest of this calendar year, I really feel great about the slate of games. We just had “Avowed” come out, and I have to go backwards and just say Obsidian continues to do a great job. We’ve obviously talked about “The Outer Worlds 2,” “South of Midnight,” “Doom.” There’s more stuff, some stuff that’s unannounced and I’m walking in my head to make sure I don’t leak anything.</em>"</p>
<p>One of the games that Spencer is trying to avoid talking about is likely the one that has already leaked: the remaster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, which could be officially confirmed in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Other potential titles could be the long-rumored Gears of War and Halo Collections coming to PlayStation and possibly even Nintendo. There's been less buzz around those of late, but if Xbox continues to be as good at keeping secrets the way it's kept the Oblivion remaster a secret, we won't have to wait very long to hear more about either collection.</p>
<p>Spencer was also asked about the Nintendo Switch 2, and he said that he wants to support it and that "<em>Nintendo has been a great partner."</em></p>
<p>"<em>We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren’t PC players, who aren’t players on Xbox...I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.</em>"</p>
<p>Speaking of Xbox's future, the platform's next big date will be its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">upcoming June showcase</a>. After that, we'll have a better idea of what 2025 looks like for Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-planet-crafter-update-biggest-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced a brand new update for open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, and the Moons Update is set to be the game's biggest yet, according to the developer.</p>

<p>Miju says that the "love" it received upon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">releasing</a> the game's recent&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC persuaded the studio to "continue to support&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>for a long time", and that the Moons Update will "bring [the game] to the next level".</p>

<p>You'll be able to visit two new moons after you've finished terraforming your first planet, and once you're on a moon, you'll be able to terraform that as well. You'll keep all your blueprints, knowledge, and equipment, and you'll even be able to exchange resources between planets and moons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-planet-crafter-moons-update-facility.jpg?itok=UmiOto_K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-planet-crafter-moons-update-facility.jpg?itok=zIrZkiH8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s next update is going to be a big one.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes include lots of new items, the ability to build different rockets on departure platforms, and more. The changelog is temporary right now, though, so more could be added to the update as it nears its full release.</p>

<p>Right now, you can only check out the Moons Update on&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s development branch. The update doesn't have a full release date yet, but if you want to see how to access the dev branch, you can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1284190/announcements/detail/588390482275468569" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this Steam post</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game based largely around terraforming planets. Your goal is to land on a planet and render its ecosystem habitable for humanity.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll have to gather resources from said planet in order to survive, and you'll need to find a way to generate oxygen and warmth to make sure you can live in your new environment as well.</p>




<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/649665/microsoft-xbox-copilot-first-look-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing an early version of its Copilot for Gaming experience. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s Xbox plans tell me that employees can now access Copilot within the Xbox mobile app, and that while it looks similar to the existing Copilot chatbot, it’s designed to tap into your Xbox account.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Announced last month</a>, Copilot for Gaming will eventually be available across multiple devices — including Xbox consoles — to act as a companion or assistant that can guide you through games, download and launch titles, and more.</p><p>To my understanding, the early version available to Microsoft employees – which might change before release – includes the ability to pull up your recent Xbox achievements, get game recommendations based on your play history, and ask for tips about completing games. You’ll also be able to use this assistant to download and install games on your Xbox console.</p><p>Much like the existing Copilot, you can type to this Xbox chatbot or use voice to ask questions. You can also pick between a variety of voices: energetic, wise, chill, or heroic. Microsoft is also working on Copilot characters that will be animated versions of the AI assistant, but this isn’t present in the Xbox version yet.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on more features for its Copilot for Gaming experience in general, with ambitions to use its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645666/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-beta-testing">Copilot Vision feature</a> to let the AI assistant see what you see during games on a PC. This will, if Microsoft can pull it off, eventually allow Copilot to fully guide you through games and offer tips on how to play titles like <em>Overwatch 2</em> or <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>This initial Copilot for Gaming feature will be available to Xbox Insiders soon, and Microsoft plans to tweak it constantly based on feedback from Xbox players. It’s not clear when this gaming Copilot will appear on Xbox consoles though, but I’d imagine it’s a while away given that Microsoft has only just started testing Copilot inside the Xbox mobile app.</p><p>I’m interested to hear what feedback Microsoft gets about Copilot for Gaming, particularly because it will debut as a feature inside the Xbox mobile app. I’m not sure why I’d use a chatbot to download and install Xbox games or check my achievements, but if Microsoft can actually turn this into an AI gaming coach then that would certainly pique my interest.</p><div><p id="xbox-games-keep-appearing-on-battle-net"><h2><strong>Xbox games keep appearing on Battle.net</strong></h2></p></div><p>Blizzard’s PC launcher, Battle.net, used to only have a handful of games available to download and install, but it’s quickly becoming Microsoft’s launcher of choice for new and existing Xbox games. <em>Avowed </em>launched on Battle.net recently, and now <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is <a href="https://x.com/seaofthieves/status/1911832579306569928?s=12">heading to the launcher</a> next month.</p><p>What’s interesting about these two additions is that they’re not Activision or Blizzard games, and both are available for Game Pass subscribers.You had to use the Xbox app or Microsoft Store to access Game Pass titles on PC previously, but by opening them up to Battle.net, Microsoft is signaling that it might be open to enabling Game Pass access on more PC launchers.</p><p>This isn’t just two games, either. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also coming to Battle.net at launch, and Game Pass subscribers will be able to get these through this launcher, too. The downloads are fully managed by the Battle.net client instead of being handed off to the Microsoft Store, and all you need to do is link your accounts to get access to Game Pass titles.</p><p>I doubt this means Microsoft will fully move away from the Microsoft Store and Xbox app for Game Pass installs. But with millions of Battle.net users, it does mean the company can offer up more choices for how people obtain and play Xbox games. The Battle.net launcher is certainly another opportunity to sell PC players on PC Game Pass or Xbox Play Anywhere titles.</p><p>If you know more about Microsoft’s Battle.net plans, you can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/soK8N9/6J1KVh2/ZZblbDEGXHNH1gK0Q+RaxJQ7vUxDDTYvxX8hARqMZfjuz3Egj">I’m tomwarren.01</a>. </p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is slowing some of its data center buildouts. </strong>After weeks of reports about Microsoft adjusting its data center projects, the company has finally admitted things are slowing down. “We are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects,” said Noelle Walsh, Microsoft’s president of cloud operations and innovation, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/noelle-walsh-b29356108_microsoftcloud-datacenters-activity-7315439628562423808-W67e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGe5_YBNBxfcDaC5YJlW57cvMMdg5ZCG-g">post on LinkedIn</a> last week. Microsoft says it will continue to invest in regions where it has existing data centers and projects, but it’s obviously being more cautious about early stage investments.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is about to launch Recall for real this time. </strong>The feature that captures screenshots of most of what you do on a Copilot Plus PC is finally about to launch. Recall was supposed to debut alongside Copilot Plus PCs last June, but after security researchers raised concerns, it was delayed multiple times so that the company could properly secure it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646911/microsoft-recall-windows-insiders-preview">It’s now in Release Preview</a>, which means it’s only weeks away from releasing to all Copilot Plus PC owners.</span></li><li><span><strong>ActiveX is now disabled by default in Microsoft 365 apps</strong>.

Microsoft had previously switched the default to “Prompt me before enabling all controls with minimal restrictions,” which allowed Office users to still run ActiveX controls. “The new default setting is more secure because it blocks these controls entirely, reducing the risk of malware or unauthorized code execution,” Microsoft says.</span></li><li><span><strong>GPT-4.1 heads to Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service</strong>.

Microsoft has started <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24H2#3370msgdesc">removing a block</a> on some PCs that were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, version 24H2.

Microsoft patched a vulnerability in Windows earlier this month that randomly added an inetpub folder to the root of your C:\ drive. This folder is typically associated with Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) web server, but <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21204">Microsoft warns</a> that Windows users shouldn’t delete it after the update because it’s “part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users.”</span></li><li><span><strong><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong><strong> is imminent</strong>. Leaked images from developer Virtuous’ own website have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">confirmed a long-rumored <em>Oblivion </em>remake</a>. Rumors suggest that <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>will be announced as a shadow drop next week, and I previously reported that Microsoft was aiming to release this remastered version in late spring or early summer.</span></li><li><span><strong>The Snipping Tool now has a text extractor</strong>. If you’re a Windows Insider, you can <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/04/15/text-extractor-in-snipping-tool-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/">now test the new text extractor feature</a> inside the Snipping Tool app on Windows 11.

            <p>
11 Bit Studios have shared new details and images of their untitled Project 8, a mournful third-person action-adventure that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-creators-cancel-project-8-and-lay-off-staff-amid-concerns-that-narrative-driven-story-rich-games-dont-sell">cancelled last year amid layoffs</a>. CEO Przemysław Marszał observed at the time that "it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal" - a comment that made me want to unplug the internet and crawl into bed with a choose-your-own-adventure book. Now, Marszał has offered a fuller account of the cancellation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">a Eurogamer report</a> penned by Prince Robert of Purchese. According to the report, Project 8's main character was a slender, masculine figure equipped with a slingshot you could use to distract threats. Set in a colourful fantasy world, the game would have focussed on stealth, climbing and environmental puzzling rather than combat. Its story was a process of working through the five stages of grief after losing a loved one. In brief, it sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gris">Gris</a>, Prince of Persia, and the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>. 
</p>
<p>
So why was it abandoned? According to Marszał, 11 Bit were overambitious about moving into the third-person action-adventure genre, having expanded their workforce dramatically off the back of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s success. With little direct experience to call upon, the Project 8 team struggled with both the relatively arcane 'stages of grief' concept and more familiar difficulties, like how to make hiding from enemies enjoyable. All this was, of course, exacerbated by wider factors such as the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"We felt like it would be possible to do another game in a totally different genre, with a bit of a crazy difficult topic, with a new team," Marszał told the site. "And it was a bit too optimistic to be honest. We thought a lot about it so it wasn't like 'hey let's do it', but going back, it was a bit too optimistic, and thinking that games are easy. And making games isn't easy. It's very difficult stuff." 
</p>
<p>
According to Marszał, Project 8 faced frequent delays over the course of "seven or eight years" in development. After all that time, the only playable parts of the game were a prologue and a level themed around the emotion of denial, which feels rather on-the-nose as poetic ironies go. "And when we heard that we need to add another year or two to the production time it was like 'wow'," Marszał went on. 
</p>
<p>
Following this proposed delay, 11 Bit considered Project 8's odds of success against wider market conditions at the time. In particular, they looked at the reception for similar emotive or psychological action-adventure games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>. They eventually came to the conclusion that they would lose money selling the game.
</p>
<p>
"We allowed ourselves - that was the optimism - to do too difficult a game," Marszał concludes in the piece. "It had a cool premise but that wasn't wise, especially for a team that was doing the game as a first game. It was just too ambitious. It was multiple aspects that, at the end, we knew, no, we won't make it. Either [cancel it] or we will spend another tens of millions of dollars and fail heavily." 
</p>
<p>
A number of 11 Bit staffers were slated to lose their jobs alongside Porject 8's cancellation, though some appear to have been transferred to other projects. Marszał has now confirmed that 18 people were let go. If you're one of them, I hope you've found your feet elsewhere.

                <p dir="ltr">Ninja Gaiden has been on a long hiatus, and for fans of the classic 2D games on the NES, it's been even longer. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is a classic throwback from publisher Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge) and developer The Game Kitchen (Blasphemous series). But while Ragebound shows their respect for retro craftsmanship, it feels more like an evolution of the 8-bit originals than a broad reinvention. This is still an action-platformer at heart, serving as a respectful homage to Ninja Gaiden classics that picks up right where those left off.</p><p dir="ltr">During an extended hands-on with Ragebound I was able to try a lengthy chunk from the early hours of the game: a playable story sequence, tutorial, and then a few stages full of tense combat and new mechanics that fit right into the classic feel of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1456601196" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

their village when Ryu journeys to America. When a barrier between the human and demon realms tears apart, the village is beset by demons and Kenji steps up to be the new protector of the realm. But in the course of the story, the demo also introduced a secondary protagonist: the Black Spider ninja Kumori. The Black Spider Clan was a major antagonist in the later Team Ninja games, so in a way, this is bridging the gap between the two eras of the series.</p><p dir="ltr">The two also offer differentiation to their gameplay styles that keeps you juggling between different abilities. Kumori's spirit fuses into Kenji's body, allowing you to switch between the physical and spirit realms at will. While Kenji uses the katana blade with a very similar feel to the originals, Kumori's specialty is throwable kunai blades. Kenji is an acrobatic melee fighter, especially with the ability to bounce off of enemies and projectiles in mid-air, while Kumori is better suited for ranged attacks. That gives the two a very different feel, and allows you to switch into the spirit realm to solve platforming puzzles and combat scenarios that aren't possible with Kenji alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Kenji and Kumori also have access to a Hypercharge ability: a devastatingly powerful attack with special properties. Defeating enemies charges up the special attack, but like a combo counter, it resets if you get hit. That heightens the combat tension, as you could use the Hypercharge as soon as you get it or try to hold onto it for a particularly tough enemy. Both Kenji's katana and Kumori's kunai build the charge, but when you're separated, you only have access to half of your power set. It's a clever way to express through gameplay that these two are strongest when joined together, even if they hate it.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a major source of strife, at least in the early game, as the two ancient enemies constantly snipe at each other and vent their biases and grudges. As the title implies, Kenji is the cool and well-centered operator while Kumori is more aggressive and, well, full of rage. Enemies who come to rely on each other is a classic storytelling trope but it's done well here, against the backdrop of a fantastical, demon-filled Japan. It helps flesh out the characters and gives a Black Spider ninja the rare opportunity to step into the spotlight as a hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these changes and new wrinkles, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound feels right at home next to the classic tough-as-nails Nintendo games. The original Ninja Gaiden games were known for their tight, unforgiving platforming. Ragebound looks to be slightly more forgiving than those originals, but given my experience with a few of the early stages, it still looks to be a skill-testing action-platforming challenge. Everything from the weight of the jumps to the speed of your blade feels, if not identical to the originals, at least in conversation with those mechanics in a way that felt immediately inviting and familiar to me as a longtime fan.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4477681" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4477681"></a><figcaption>Kenji summons the help of Kumori in Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4477681-ninjagaidenragebound-newscreenshot2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And as you'd expect from this pairing of publisher and developer, the pixel art is characteristically gorgeous. The environments are darker than the vibrant tones of TMNT but not as gothic as Blasphemous, and the characters themselves are smaller in relation to their backgrounds, but their movements are perfectly readable. The yokai designs are a particular standout, looking traditional while adding splashes of color that look intentionally unnatural against the more grounded scope.</p><p dir="ltr">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is coming this summer to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

It’s a lot of hard work, but it’s a lot less hard work than making a whole new game, and only one of them is certain to make lots of money. New games, and especially new IPs, now come with enormous risk, where hundreds of millions of dollars can evaporate in a single disastrous launch week. The teams creating <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Concord</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>worked incredibly hard, exhaustingly so, and the results were massive financial black holes. If their time had instead been dedicated to making a proven success look prettier, profits would have been practically guaranteed. Remastering games is a pragmatic decision based on prudent economics. It’s just that it also sucks.</p><figure id="" data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>This is the game running vanilla, no mods, and it clearly doesn’t need a remaster.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s a secret fact about <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>: It works just fine. Great, in fact. Released in 2006, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can buy it from Steam right now for $15</a></span> (and frequently far, far less), and it works perfectly right away. It runs in 2560x1440, requires no hacks or mods, and within minutes of booting it up just now I wasn’t noticing that the graphics are dated. Heck, Bethesda games’ graphics are dated at launch, invariably improved by modders in the months that follow—no one was buying <em>Oblivion</em> for its looks in 2006, not least the hilariously terrible character models. And given <em>Starfield</em>’s are just as embarrassing, it’s not like that’s going to suddenly improve either.</p><p>The point is, <em>Oblivion</em> already exists in a very playable form that’s just as entertaining and flawed as it was 20 years ago. Also, there are 20 years’ worth of mods to improve all the aspects that Bethesda is pathologically incapable of doing well—UI, facial animations, inventory arrangement, voice acting, textures—to have the game look and run exactly as you want. So what, precisely, is an officially remastered <em>Oblivion </em>for?</p><p>Yes, like I said, it’s for making money, especially from long-term fans of the game who <em>do </em>want to see it look prettier, returning to a Cyrodiil  whose graphics look like their two-decade-old invented memories of the original. There’s also the potential to draw in a new audience who’s perhaps only ever played <em>Skyrim</em>, so they can be disappointed to learn the predecessor wasn’t nearly as good. But even <em>Skyrim</em>’s original audience is noticing a little more grey in their hair, given that was nearly 14 years ago.</p><p>This is then made more frustrating given the extraordinary efforts of the <em>Skyblivion</em> modders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043">who have spent over a decade remaking <em>Oblivion</em> in <em>Skyrim</em>’s engine</a></span>, hoping to finally finish their herculean project in 2025.

While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG has recently launched some significant efforts to preserve PC gaming</a></span>, it’s barely scratching the surface of a vast history of video games that are being lost to time and technology, because those who own the rights either don’t care or are actively hostile to anyone attempting to preserve their games for them. Games that cannot just be bought from Steam and run with a click are certainly not receiving elaborate remakes, and can now only be played via illegal methods.</p><p>Now, I’m not daft, and I’m not advocating for publishers to spend millions of dollars remastering forgotten, obscure games from their 1980s and ‘90s catalogues; I know they’re far more likely to plunder them for titles to attach to wildly different new games (cough-<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940"><em>Marathon</em></a></span>-cough). Still, I do really believe that dedicating a fraction of the resources that go into remasters to preserving a company’s back-catalogue would be beneficial to humanity. Or, you know, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>just releasing them into the public domain like they obviously should</em></a></span>. </p><p>However, I think this should also be recognized as part of the existential malaise in which video games now find themselves, where the AA game is all but non-existent and new ideas are kryptonite to publishers.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, the ballooning costs of game development would be the subject of a whole other article, and the industry’s obsessive focus on live-service is yet another, but these and other crippling aspects of game creation under late-stage capitalism all contribute toward the reasons why remastering has become so endemic. As I’ve said, it’s safe. And right now, publishers are retreating toward perceived safety like terrified kittens. But doing this can only make the problems worse—they can only solidify the notion that the only sure way to make a profitable game is to have it be one you’ve made already.</p><p>What we need are bold new ideas made at sensible prices. And it’s agonizing to watch the indie world produce original hit after original hit, and publishers unable to recognize how they could be funding and profiting from this phenomenon at a AA level. The reason there are so many great games to plunder and remaster is because for decades previously, this is how game development worked! There was no need for a game to make half a billion dollars for it to have been worth releasing, when doing so gave the developers the opportunity to create fresh conceits that could gain widening popularity that fueled ever-more sequels and spin-offs.</p><p>Because while it’s grimly amusing to joke about Naughty Dog remaking the same three games for the rest of eternity, the company also demonstrates that it’s a Sisyphean task. Endlessly updating a game to reflect the latest gimmicks in graphics is folly, that boulder always rolling back down as fast as it can be pushed up, withe the miserable irony that it’s just as good of a boulder when left at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>Bethesda, for crying out loud, get on with making <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> and leave the perfectly good and perfectly enjoyable <em>Oblivion </em>and <em>Fallout 3</em> to the modders. And, for goodness sakes, release <em>Morrowind</em>’s source code. And the same goes for everyone else.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's been quite the year for Destiny players, and the game's evolution continues with the latest chapter, dubbed The Edge of Fate, getting revealed soon. No details were given outside of the reveal being a special livestream event on May 6, starting at 9AM PT/12PM ET.</p><p>"Developers will discuss the first expansion, The Edge of Fate, and much more during the event," Bungie <a href="https://press.bungie.com/Bungie-Announces-Reveal-Event-for-Destiny-2-The-Edge-of-Fate" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. With the events of The Final Shape having major repercussions for your Guardian, as well as the Vanguard, it feels like all bets are off when it comes to the story.</p><p>How the story is structured is something else. Following the launch of The Final Shape last year, Bungie announced changes to how it planned to deliver content, switching from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">Seasons to Episodes</a>, while also announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-concept-art-sheds-just-a-little-light-on-upcoming-expansion/1100-6526840/" data-ref-id="1100-6526840">the future of Destiny 2 as Codename: Frontiers</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477664" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477664"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 roadmap for 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Starting with Destiny: Edge of Fate, the game will get two expansions, with four "major updates" per year. Fans have been eager to know specifics regarding what's next for Destiny 2 as the episodic content has now come to a close, and any sort of schedule has remained a mystery.</p><p>This latest expansion for Destiny 2 is expected to be what was given the codename "Apollo". Per the roadmap Bungie released back in September, Apollo was scheduled to release sometime in Summer 2025. Apollo is planned to be a paid expansion with new stories, locations, missions, and more. However, it won’t be the only update coming to the game. Bungie is also planning another full expansion called Behemoth for Winter 2025, which will also have the two major updates leading into spring of next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-will-be-a-15-minute-in-depth-look-at-the-new-open-world-kart-racer.1165728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo will live stream its Mario Kart World Direct tomorrow morning, <strong>April 17, 2025</strong>, at <strong>6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The direct was announced when Nintendo first showcased Mario Kart World during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> at the beginning of the month as the next chance we'd get to learn more about it. With the live stream placeholder now up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, we know that it will only be a 15-minute presentation in which Nintendo says we'll get an "<em>in-depth</em>" look at the new kart racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo shows in this direct, but, of course, we've seen a lot about Mario Kart World since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this month. A big part of the conversation has been around the fact that Mario Kart World is one of the few Nintendo Switch 2 games that will cost $80.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World is worth the increased price.</a> Bowser even highlighted tomorrow's direct, telling players with doubts to tune in and see what Nintendo shows off.</p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to</em> <em>discover</em>." Bowser told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fmario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fswitch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=a8794423f20c06ce869d8877c3daa0d3&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">IGN</a>. "<em>And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.</em>"</p>
<p>Wccftech's own Nathan Birch had the chance to play Mario Kart World during a recent Nintendo event, and while he admits to having fun with the game, it also didn't blow him away. That said, there's still a lot of potential that can't be seen in a short 20-minute demo. We'll see how much tomorrow's 15-minute direct adds to that.</p>
<p>"<em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times."</em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Birch wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-released-for-true-masochists.1165722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and if you've been waiting for the immersive medieval RPG to up its difficulty a few (hundred) notches, this one's for you.</p>

<p>Patch 1.2.4's biggest addition is Hardcore Mode, which was promised as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">post-launch roadmap back in January</a>. As the name suggests, this isn't one for the faint of heart, so be sure you know what you're in for before you fire it up.</p>

<p>Hardcore Mode removes a number of gameplay elements to which you may have become accustomed, like your character's position appearing on the map, compass directions, and the ability to fast travel. It really is that brutal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-soldiers.jpg?itok=0Z753m3V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-soldiers.jpg?itok=jTLEuIaJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Fast travel? Sorry, friend. We don't know what that is."</figcaption></figure><p>As if that wasn't enough, you'll also have to choose at least three negative perks that will weigh you down for the rest of your playthrough. These include "Sweaty", which "increases your personal pungency", and "Numbskull", which slows your XP gain. Yikes.</p>

<p>You can read a little more about Hardcore Mode <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hardcore-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, but suffice it to say this definitely isn't one for you if you prefer a more leisurely stroll through Bohemia. You'll have to get, well, sweaty if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>If you're not interested in Hardcore Mode, don't worry; there's still plenty for you to enjoy as part of this update. Other changes include rebalanced herb prices in shops, as well as a new bald hairstyle (or lack of, I suppose) for Henry.</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.2.4 are available <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Warhorse's official website</a> if you want to know everything that's new. It's not a long list, so don't worry!</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's an open-world RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>, it places an emphasis on realism over fantasy elements like magic or monsters.</p>

<p>The game was a hit for Warhorse and parent company Embracer Group, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">racking up two million sales</a> within its first two weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios has announced that a new game in the series is on the way, although you're going to have to wait a fair while for it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game was revealed as part of 11 bit's <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, in which CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says "production on the next project set in the <em>Frostpunk</em> universe" has begun. The company is currently aiming to launch the game in 2027.</p>

<p>11 bit CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says the decision is part of his studio's response to a shifting market, with 11 bit looking to "diversify both the scale of projects and the time [it devotes] to each of them".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=vmuZrUji 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=2NTHoh5i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios has revealed that a new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is set for 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Marszał stopped short of explaining exactly what the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is, so we don't yet know whether he's referring to a potential&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 3&nbsp;</em>or simply to a new spinoff game set in the same world as the city-builders.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that 11 bit is also working on "a slightly larger title", which the company expects to launch in 2029.

<p>The news comes as 11 bit reports an operating loss of around $750,000 for 2024, despite a 168.9% sales increase marking "the highest sales in the Company’s history".</p>

After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">widespread reports</a> of black screens, game crashes, and general stability issues, today’s 576.02 driver release (<a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-desktop-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql.exe">.exe download</a>) not only bumps the version number significantly from last month’s 572.83, it also includes a number of significant fixes.</p><p>The <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf">release notes</a> for Nvidia’s 576.02 driver mention that it fixes stability issues with Windows 11 version 24H2, a BSOD when playing DLSS 4 games with Multi Frame Generation, random black screen issues with the RTX 50-series GPUs, and general system stability issues. Nvidia has also addressed “game stability issues when playing games with DLSS Frame Generation + GSYNC.”</p><p>This driver release also fixes random crashes in <em>Fortnite</em>, a <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> hang after the game is idle, a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> crash, and stutter when using VSYNC in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. There are also a variety of fixes for <em>Hellblade 2</em>, <em>Control</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em>, and <em>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</em>.</p><p>It’s an unusual amount of bug fixes for Nvidia’s usual driver updates, which regularly contain only a handful of fixed gaming or general bugs that fill half a page of Nvidia’s release notes. These latest bug fixes take up almost two pages this time around.</p><p>Hopefully this large list addresses most of the complaints we’ve seen ever since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 release in January</a>. While Nvidia has struggled with RTX 50-series driver stability, the issues have also been impacting existing GPUs after the introduction of DLSS 4.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s 576.02 driver also supports the GeForce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti GPU that’s launching today</a>, starting at $379.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and according to the patch notes, this one is designed to address several more issues in the game. Title update 1.0.3 will go live today, and while it's not nearly as massive as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">previous patch</a>, you can expect bug fixes and PS5 Pro improvements. Curiously, the patch will also temporarily deactivate the auto-sell feature in the game, as Ubisoft says that it has to work out some unexpected issues introduced by that function.</p><p>For PS5 Pro players, a graphical issue caused by activating the HDR and PSSR options will be fixed, and PS5 owners in general can expect several other crash-related bugs to be solved. For download sizes, the patch is quite small on PS5 and PC via Steam, while Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Mac users can expect a longer download session.
