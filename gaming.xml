However, if you were thinking about buying the old PS4 version now so you can pay the small upgrade fee and save some money on that remaster, well, you waited too long, because Sony has doubled the price on the original game to stop anyone from doing that. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On September 24 during the latest State of Play, Sony officially announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-leak-esrb-rating-ps5-pc-1851651357?_gl=1*1ip480f*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM4NzgxMC4xODUuMS4xNzI3Mzg3ODgzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-leak-esrb-rating-ps5-pc-1851651357?_gl=1*1ip480f*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM4NzgxMC4xODUuMS4xNzI3Mzg3ODgzLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Horizon: Zero Dawn Remastered</em></a></span>, confirming rumors and an earlier ESRB leak<em>.</em> This new remastered version of the 2017 post-apocalyptic open-world game features newly recorded dialogue and a ton of visual enhancements.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-day-before-devs-return-with-%E2%80%98fntastic-2-0%E2%80%99-and-a-new-kickstarter-campaign.993858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs-return-fntastic-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I bet you didn’t see this coming.</p>



<p>In December 2023, The Day Before, a long-awaited, highly anticipated survival shooter, was released by Fntastic after years of development. It quickly turned out to be nothing short of a scam, with the game launching in a miserable state, after which Fntastic pulled it offline and shut down the studio.</p>



<p>Now, almost a year since the studio disappeared, the team is back with ‘Fntastic 2.0’.</p>



<p>Before we get started, let’s highlight that this is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs/">same developer who said ‘shit happens’</a> on social media when their game was taken offline.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-guess-who-s-back">Guess Who’s Back?</h2>



<p>In a shocking post on social media, the Fntastic team returned, stating that ‘everyone deserves a second chance’. They posted a link to a new game called ‘Escape Factory’ and stressed that they’re planning to fix their past mistakes. By ‘past mistakes’, they mean the swindling of thousands of gamers that left them a laughingstock of the gaming community.</p>



<p>They’re back on the scene with a Kickstarter that they’re putting together to generate funds to make more games, including the one I’ve just named.</p>



<p>I’m not even kidding:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regaining trust will be tough, but we're motivated to make more games if our Kickstarter succeeds. With its 'all or nothing' model, contributions will be refunded if we miss the target. We value your support, and all funds will go to development, not profit.</p>— Fntastic (@FntasticHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839423294422024688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the Kickstarter has made a whopping £154 out of a goal of £11,646 (what a random number). If you back their campaign with a $12,000 donation, you’ll get an ‘unforgettable dinner’ with the founders of Fntastic.</p>



<p>This is the most laughable thing I’ve seen in years. They’re actually saying that they need the community’s help if they’re going to revive Fntastic, and they even <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66cf2872c641a645890f1c5d/t/66e3f77eace4a55f13841699/1726216072958/Fntastic-2-0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a whitepaper</a> outlining their desire to change. They’ve ‘rebranded’ by changing the colour palette of their logo, and they’re now preaching honesty, transparency, and professionalism.</p>



<p>They also have a new mission!</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to create games that will be loved for decades.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is brilliant.</p>







<p>Here’s the spiel for their new game, too:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as life-weary workers trying to escape the vicious cycle of deadly factories from which there’s no easy way out. Legend has it that only one great and mysterious individual has ever escaped.</p>



<p>Team up with 4-8 players for pure multiplayer co-op physics-based fun challenges. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>If they raise $200,000, they’ll make the game and bring it to all platforms. I can’t see them making 1% of that, but shall we see how far they’re willing to take this?</p>



<p>If you’re going to put your trust in Fntastic 2.0, let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has arrived, bringing Zelda's first starring role in a mainline entry to Nintendo Switch. This top-down Zelda experience isn't as chunky as its open-world counterparts, but it still has plenty to see, including both main story quests and side activities. Echoes of Wisdom marks another first for the series as well, marking the first game in the franchise to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-features-franchises-first-female-director/1100-6526641/">female director</a>. Here's how long you can expect it to take to beat The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long to beat The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Wisdom features an open-world map and its main story functions similarly to Tears of The Kingdom and Breath of the Wild in that you are given a few map markers to go to in your preferred order. While you can certainly complete these at your leisure, there aren't as many side activities to get lost doing, although there are definitely some.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Legend Of Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A typical playthrough for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will take <strong>between 20 to 25 hours</strong>, depending on how much exploring and side quests you do. That said, if you were to focus only on the main quests, you could likely finish as quickly as 15 hours, and finding everything there is to offer will take you upwards of 30 hours. In terms of main objectives, there are a total of seven main dungeons to complete, along with side activities and areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 9/10 review</a>, with critic Steven Petite writing, "If Zelda's debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it's a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. Echoes of Wisdom's brilliantly integrated echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise's classic formula. Don't mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big 'mainline' games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a major moment that shouldn't be missed."</p>

            <p>I don't know why we haven't written about Mechabellum before now, but we haven't. Let's correct that. It's an autobattler in which you plonk down squads of stompy robots then watch them win or lose against your opponent's army based on the formations and upgrades you've chosen. After more than a year in Early Access, it's just released version 1.0.

<p>Visually Mechabellum's robots are reminiscent of Supreme Commander, but SupCom was set across huge maps where victory had at least as much to do with economy management as your fighters on the frontline. As an autobattler, Mechabellum frontloads your decision-making in the buying and positioning of units that will then fight without your intervention in arenas that are relatively tiny.
</p>
<p>That means the strategy lies in which units you choose, how they complement each other, where you position them, and how you upgrade them. Fights happen over several rounds, with chances to re-tool your setup in between. During the battle's themselves you're mostly free to just enjoy watching the explosions, although you can call in airstrikes and make other limited contributions to the flow of a fight.
</p>
<p>Mechabellum launched in Early Access last May and has been well received since. The 1.0 release doesn't seem to make any major changes, but optimises the visuals and performance and introduces a multiplayer rank system.
</p>
<p>I haven't much interest in playing 1v1 against strangers online, because I don't want to have to learn a meta or read guides for the best builds. I'm not Matt Cox (RPS in peace). I do fancy watching robots shoot each other with rockets, though, and I've enjoyed similar strategy autobattlers like the tug-o-war of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291010/Warpips/">Warpips</a>. I'll give it a go against the AI at some point.
</p>
<p>Mechabellum is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/">available on Steam</a> where a 30% discount means it's currently £8.95/$10.49/€10.35.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-map-to-map-travel-works-in-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There’s a lot to love and a lot to hate about Escape From Tarkov. Over the years, developer Battlestate Games has made a handful of odd choices, sometimes ruining the experience for players, such as the infamous Unheard Edition. But lately, it seems like it’s on the right track. Most recently, the studio introduced map to map travel in Escape From Tarkov, allowing players to transition to new raids on different maps without returning to the menu. Here’s how it all works!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-how-map-to-map-raids-work-in-escape-from-tarkov">Here’s How Map-to-Map Raids Work in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>The latest update for Escape From Tarkov includes map-to-map transitions, allowing you to continue your raid across multiple zones and levels seemingly indefinitely. You could start in Customs or Factory, then travel to Interchange, then Streets of Tarkov, then to Ground Zero, etc. It’s a neverending cycle that should ramp up the intensity of the extraction shooter.</p>



<p>First and foremost, know that map transitions will be available between locations for all raids, and even Player Scavs may transition between maps to keep the firefights going. That said, there is a transition countdown, so don’t expect to run straight through a map and into another immediately. It does take a little time to activate after a raid begins.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Streets of Tarkov → Ground Zero</strong></li>



<li><strong>Interchange → Streets of Tarkov</strong></li>



<li><strong>Customs → Reserve</strong></li>



<li><strong>Customs → Interchange</strong></li>



<li><strong>Factory → Customs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Factory → The Lab</strong></li>



<li><strong>Woods → Factory</strong></li>



<li><strong>Woods → Lighthouse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reserve → Customs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reserve → Woods</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lighthouse → Reserve</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lighthouse → Woods</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shoreline → Lighthouse</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-can-you-travel-between-maps-in-escape-from-tarkov-pve">Can You Travel Between Maps in Escape From Tarkov PvE?</h2>



<p>While it seems like most often, the major changes launching in Escape From Tarkov primarily affect the PvP players, this time around, Battlestate is gracing the PvE community, too. You can travel between maps in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-pve-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov PvE</a>, just like you can in the PvP mode, which means completing quests and keeping the momentum is possible without raging against cheaters or sweat lords.</p>



<p>Does the new map transition update entice you to return to Escape From Tarkov? Let us know in the comments below, or perhaps you can find a squad to play online with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>?!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-devs-have-floated-the-idea-of-a-pillars-of-eternity-tactics-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>While Obsidian Entertainment continues to work on Avowed ahead of its launch next year, studio design director Josh Sawyer has revealed that some members of the team have expressed interest in creating a Pillars of Eternity tactics game.</p><p>The director behind projects like Pentiment, Fallout: New Vegas, and Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire spoke about the studio’s desires behind the scenes during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMrwkIC-Ixc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Limit Break Network</u></a>. When asked about Obsidian’s interest in creating more stories set in Eora, he mentioned that a more tactical experience is one idea that at least a few members of the team have brought to the table.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/pillars-of-eternity-1727384408647.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Some Obsidian developers have floated the idea of a Pillars of Eternity tactics game.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“There have been a number of people, actually, at the studio who have floated the idea of a Pillars tactics game,” Sawyer teased. “Tactics games are very interesting to me, and they occupy a really interesting space in the marketplace because the audience for them is not huge, typically, but very passionate.”</p><p>It’s an admission that may have some Pillars of Eternity fans frothing at the mouth, but this doesn’t mean a tactical experience set in that universe is in the works. Sawyer touches on why it might be difficult to pull a game like this together, explaining that, while big-name series like Fire Emblem have managed to draw attention for decades, it’s tough for many tactics games to reach that same level of success. Still, he says there are “a lot of people at the studio” who would like to see a Pillars of Eternity tactics game come to be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“So, who knows? Maybe someday.</p></div><p>“It’s something that a number of people have talked about and thought about,” Sawyer continues. “It’s a hard one to make a case for. Like, how big should it be? What should the size of the team be? Every once in a while, we’ll bring it up and be like, ‘Oh, we could, maybe. I don’t know. We could, maybe…’ I will say, not just for myself, but there are a lot of people at the studio who have pitched their own versions of a Pillars tactics game. So, who knows? Maybe someday.”</p><p>Whether a Pillars of Eternity tactics game will come to be remains to be seen. In the meantime, Obsidian is still hard at work on its Xbox and PC fantasy RPG, Avowed. Set in the Pillars universe, the studio has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-dev-once-again-asked-about-skyrim-comparison-points-to-the-outer-worlds"><u>told fans to expect an experience</u></a> that falls more in line with something like its past game, The Outer Worlds, than The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room"><u>a delay</u></a>, Avowed is now set to launch February 18, 2025.</p><p>While we know Obsidian plans to eventually release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-announced-xbox-e3-2021-summer-of-gaming">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, its other plans for the future remain a mystery. Last year, studio CEO Feargus Urquhart teased <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-ceo-id-love-to-make-another-fallout-before-i-retire"><u>he would like to make at least one more Fallout game before he retires</u></a>, though no such project has been announced by Obsidian yet. While a potential Pillars of Eternity 3 has also not be confirmed, Sawyer did say last year that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget"><u>he would make a third game so long as his team got a Baldur’s Gate 3-sized budget</u></a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <p>
The end is in sight for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/simpsons-tapped-out">The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a>, EA's long-running and hugely successful free-to-play city builder. The publisher has announced it's removing the mobile game from app stores this October, some 12 years after its initial release.
</p>
<p>
The Simpsons: Tapped Out launched for iOS and Android <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-the-simpsons-tapped-out">back in 2012</a>, challenging players to rebuild Springfield after Homer Simpson's negligence causes a nuclear meltdown. By 2014, it had generated over $130 million in revenue, and it's continued to receive updates since then. 
</p>
<p>
But 12 years on, development is officially coming to an end - a decision EA called an "emotional one" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSimpsonsTappedOut/posts/pfbid02EAvK322GtkFzFo5xpCDihMmz8hwtmRuXE5S3KSNXFUd6v3sk9UCJ8e1J9aSdRWi9l?locale=en_GB">statement</a> shared on The Simpsons: Tapped Out's official Facebook page.

<p>
"It has been a remarkable journey," the statement continued, "and we are grateful that we've been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines. As our journey comes to a close, we offer our sincerest thanks to you, the players, who have made this all possible."
</p>
<p>
Following todays news, all in-app purchases have been disabled and The Simpsons: Tapped Out will be removed from app stores on 31st October this year. Players won't have to wave goodbye to their virtual Springfields immediately, however - EA is keeping Tapped Out's servers live for a little bit longer, with the game set to go permanently offline and inaccessible on 24th January next year.
</p>
<p>
"We're aware of an issue with the in-game currency to donut conversion and are investigating", the publisher wrote in a follow-up post, which feels like an appropriately surreal note to end on.

<p>With so many upcoming video games to keep an eye on, especially on PC, you really must whittle down the list by ensuring you can run everything. It wouldn’t do to become overhyped for an upcoming title and then find out your system can’t handle the game. But I don’t think you have to worry about that here. Here’s a look at the Fantasian Neo Dimension system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fantasian-neo-dimension-pc-system-requirements">The Fantasian Neo Dimension PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>Overall, you don’t have to worry much about the Fantasian Neo Dimension system requirements. It’s an old-school RPG with an art style and graphics that match, so the PC requirements aren’t overly demanding. It appears an old gaming computer can run the game without any issue, or perhaps even a laptop, though we’re hoping to play Fantasian Neo Dimension on Steam Deck, so fingers crossed for support there!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6100</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 460 / Intel Arc A380 / Nvidia GeForce GT 1030</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 11</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 15 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6100</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 560 / Intel Arc A580 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 950</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 11</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 15 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-fantasian-neo-dimension">When Can You Play Fantasian Neo Dimension?</h2>



<p>The upcoming RPG from developer Mistwalker Corporation and publisher Square Enix is nearly upon us. You can play FANTASIAN Neo Dimension on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>. </p>



<p>If you intend to play the turn-based RPG, you can pre-order a copy now for $49.99 on Steam. There’s even a pre-order bonus available for buying the game early, which includes an in-game item that increases the overall EXP you earn in a battle for whichever character equips the item before combat. But it’s important to note that you can still find the item in-game by playing through the story, and it’s not solely a pre-order bonus that you’ll miss out on if you choose not to pre-order.</p>



<p>Can your system run Fantasian Neo Dimension? Do you intend to buy the RPG? Let us know in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our official community forums</a> to start a discussion!</p>

Everything you encounter has been crafted to convey the physical, often fragile, natural world of paper, amidst a story interwoven with threads of wistful intrigue.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Transform to Use Powerful Abilities</strong> – Discover new forms to traverse the world, solve puzzles, and best your foes. Roll through obstacles and enemies alike as a hardy Armadillo, traverse the treetops and pound pests as a mighty Ape, and leap to previously unreachable heights as a formidable Frog.</li><li><strong>Protect a Fragile Origami World</strong> – A powerful force of digital creatures—the Blight—is invading the world, defiling the delicate natural balance that has held sway for an age. As Hiro, an enigmatic performer (and master of the art of folding) from Shishiki village, it falls to you to cleanse the mind-warped inhabitants of this world, and to bring peace back to the land.</li><li><strong>Discover Untold Mysteries</strong> – Explore every nook and cranny and discover all the world’s hidden secrets. Unfold into a sheet of paper to ride fiery updrafts, or to slide under deadly traps. Or become a paper plane to traverse dangerous chasms.</li><li><strong>Beat Your Enemies to a Pulp</strong> – This origami world is a fragile place, and you’ll need your wits about you to protect it. Wield Hiro’s paper fan to blow away the Blight, or pound, pummel, or poison them using your litany of papery powers.</li><li><strong>Savor a Soothing Japanese Soundtrack</strong> – Bask in a soundscape composed using traditional Japanese instruments and styles—specially crafted to evoke the variety of themes, characters and settings of <em>Hirogami</em>.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-update-enrages-fanbase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Wizards of the Coast quietly updated their <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander ban list. Unlike the recent update to their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Modern ban</a> list, this change has lead to passionate outrage within the Magic: The Gathering community due to depleting cards of hundreds of dollars in value.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander Ban List update was made public via <a href="https://x.com/JoshLeeKwai/status/1838294523925139738">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) by The Command Cast's director, Josh Lee Kwai.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-jeweled-lotus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=aHxaIWNa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-jeweled-lotus-card-artwork.jpg?itok=bZoKYeP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post stated that the Commander Rules Committee banned <em>Mana Crypt</em>, <em>Jeweled Lotus</em>, <em>Dockside Extortionist</em>, and <em>Nadu</em>, <em>Winged Wisdom</em> from Commander format. The post ends with a poll on whether or not this was a good thing.</p>
<p>This is important because the cards mentioned don't just see heavy use in competitive Commander format; they are pricey as well. TCGPlayer's own Cassie LaBelle <a href="https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/article/Cassie-Calls-Did-You-Just-Lose-$400/3bd25f7b-c617-4a79-8711-859dffd780c2" rel="nofollow">illustrates the drop</a> in value. One example is <em>Dockside Extortionist</em>, worth as much as $160, potentially losing up to 90% of its value due to not seeing much play outside of Commander.</p>
<p>The result of this <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list update has been passionate outrage by the community. Several change.org petitions have been circulating requesting a reversal of the ban (at 4,676 signatures), and firing the Commander Rules Committee (1,144 signatures).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-foil-nadu-card-artwork.jpg?itok=nEwvS4R- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-foil-nadu-card-artwork.jpg?itok=M3ISCaWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In response to this outrage, the Commander Rules Committee posted an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOQ9zb6tR7gfFueqY9bjoXz6sOvv34wIZXpl4u8DcDw/edit">FAQ document</a> in a gesture of transparency. In the document, the committee strikes down accusations of insider trading, stating it holds a zero-tolerance policy of abusing knowledge of potential game changes.</p>
<p>They also reiterate the ban had more to do with the cards' functions in the current meta than their financial worth.</p>
<p>The committee also committed to the ban list change. Stating if they backpedaled now, it would only exacerbate the financial concerns. In addition, they believe the update will be better for <em>Magic's</em> competitive scene in the long-term.</p>
<p>Lastly, the committee admits that such a drastic change with no forewarning was a mistake. As of right now, they are discussing "warming up" the community to potential bans in the future.</p>

The Simpsons: Tapped Out will be removed from app stores on October 31, 2024, and while it'll continue to be playable for the rest of the year, servers will be shut down on January 24, 2025. In-app purchases have already been disabled. </p><p>"The decision to end our twelve-year journey is an emotional one," EA wrote in its Facebook post today. "Together with our partners at The Simpsons™ and The Walt Disney company, we have delighted in bringing this game to you, the fans, and seeing how you’ve each built your own beloved versions of Springfield. It has been a remarkable journey, and we are grateful that we’ve been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/tapped-out-1727378918614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Simpsons: Tapped Out will officially be sunset in January. </figcaption></figure></output><p>The Simpsons: Tapped Out launched for iOS in 2012, followed by Android in 2013, and allowed players to build their own version of Springfield. It proved wildly popular at certain points, and EA <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/1974861-electronic-arts-management-discusses-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in 2014</a> that it had generated more than $130 million life-to-date in digital net revenue. Its seasonal and holiday-themed updates proved especially beloved by fans.</p><p>Tapped Out also, however, received blowback as part of larger criticism surrounding the freemium game model. It was seemingly lampooned in a 2014 episode of South Park titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Freemium Isn't Free,"</a> which found several characters hooked on an app that looked a lot like The Simpsons: Tapped Out.</p><p>The news also highlights something of a dearth of Simpsons video games over the past decade. Tapped Out was the most recent, preceeded by The Simpsons Game in 2007 and Hit &amp; Run in 2003. The developers of the latter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-runs-developers-sequel">commented last year</a> on why that beloved game never got a sequel, despite fan demand. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Sony has quietly doubled the price of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition</em> on the PlayStation Store. </p><p>While Sony has long sold the game for $20 online — as far back as 2018, it seems — <a href="https://psprices.com/region-us/game/1838981/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition">it upped that price to $40</a> on September 25th, just one day after announcing the new remastered game. The changes were spotted <a href="https://x.com/GamePittReviews/status/1839018836357476399">by @GamePittReviews</a>. </p><p>While those of us with an<em> </em>existing copy can upgrade for $10 — regardless of whether your copy is disc or digital, PlayStation or PC — new players will have to pay a full $50 for the remastered version if they want it digitally. Sony isn’t exactly trying to hide that: “For new fans, the game can be purchased for $49.99&nbsp;on PlayStation Store, Steam, or Epic Game Store,” its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-coming-to-ps5-pc-october-31-2024/">original blog post</a> reads.</p><p>You can still pay quite a lot less, of course, by tracking down an old disc copy of the game or perhaps a PC key. Sony explicitly states that even the original PS4 disc copy of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> will work as you leave it in the drive while you’re playing — assuming you’ve got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">a PlayStation with a disc drive</a>, that is. </p><p>The new remaster promises “stunning new visuals and enhanced features,” and you can see more in the announcement trailer below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Do I like citybuilders such as Cities: Skylines and SimCity 4, or do I simply like roadbuilders? I spend most of my time in both those games tweaking the network of roads and junctions that form the veins of my cities, after all, and attempting to solve traffic jams via public transport and simulation-expanding mods.
</p>
<p>Enter Junxions, a traffic engineering game which focuses entirely on the simulation and construction of roads, railways, and pedestrian walkways, right down to the coding of the traffic lights. It's aiming for a 2025 release and you'll find its trailer below.

<p>Junxions' main mode takes you through a series of handcrafted maps where you have to use the tools available to fix traffic problems around the limitations of pre-existing structures. You'll need to account for traffic laws, as well as complications (and benefits) such as bus lanes, bike lanes, tram tracks, and all manner of pedestrian crossings.
</p>
<p>There's also a sandbox mode, for freeform experimentation, and perhaps most interestingly the ability to enter real world coordinates and generate a map based on a real world location. If you want to generate a map based on your hometown, and fix that forever-clogged junction on your commute to work, you can do so.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1447250/Junxions/">Steam page</a> also says the game is built with "full support for modding", including sharing maps, traffic solutions and importing custom models.
</p>
<p>I am genuinely thrilled this exists. People forget that Colossal Order, before making Cities: Skylines, cut their teeth on a similarly focused traffic sim, Cities In Motion. Also I'm from the roundabout-obsessed UK. We fear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Island">they may ensnare us forever</a>, and we celebrate them, as the UK Roundabout Of The Year award <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx9nlgk97eo">was named just today</a>. I look forward to finding out whether Junxions is one to die for or celebrate when it releases in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The developer, who also shipped <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, clarified that he still owns the rights to the image and would be “100% fine” with Twitch renewing them, seemingly at little or no cost. </p><p>For anyone who hasn’t spent much time in Twitch chats, the BibleThump emote has become so  second-nature and ubiquitous over the years that it feels as inseparable from the streaming platform as anything else. The sobbing mug of Isaac, a small dough-like child that fights horrors in<em> Zelda</em>-inspired dungeons beneath his home, can be found clogging up chats every time a video game showcase disappoints, like when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>goes another Nintendo direct without a release date. </p><p>So why is Twitch getting rid of the iconic symbol?

But Twitch also has a policy against emotes that “include unauthorized uses of another person’s content, brand, image, or other rights.” It could be that the company is looking to purge its repository of anything it doesn’t own the rights to itself, or doesn’t fit into its future brand deals and marketing plans. </p><p>Whatever the reason, it sucks and seems easily avoidable. Twitch’s announcement of the BibleThump emote apocalypse now has a community note. “Edmund McMillen, creator and current rights holder of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> (the property the emote originates from) has said publicly he is open to renewing the rights and/or working out a deal.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Movies often portray robots as the harbingers of something bad, whether they’re evil and want to take over the world (<em>Terminator</em>,<em> I, Robot</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>, etc.) or are being exploited by humans (<em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>A.I. Artificial Intelligence</em>, etc.). But robots aren’t all bad—they can be fun, cute, and family-friendly, too.<br></p><p>Children (and adults) love assembling robot toys and figuring out how different components interact and fit together. Robots have been a big part of kids’ movies for years, especially before the millennium, with films like <em>Bicentennial Man</em> and <em>Inspector Gadget </em>arriving in the late ‘90s. While they may not be the greatest, they capture the inventiveness that makes robots exciting for kids. </p><p><em>The Wild Robot</em>, which tells the story of a robot who learns to live in the forest and befriends an adorable little gosling, hits theaters on <em>September 27</em>. It stars Pedro Pascal, Stephanie Hsu, and Mark Hamill, and will join the lexicon of children’s movies about robotic friends.</p><p>We gathered all of these movies and tried to rank them based on their quality, considering whether they are just juvenile fluff or something more meaningful that adults can enjoy, too. Let’s get into it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cb3a43254200837d1fe32b61dab9354" data-recommend-id="image://4cb3a43254200837d1fe32b61dab9354" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Inspector Gadget flies over Manhattan.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Based on the beloved children’s cartoon, <em>Inspector Gadget</em> is one of those movies that really only appeals to kids. It’s a lot like candy: it’s vivid, brightly colored, and sends you into a frenzy, yet it lacks in substance. The movie was heavily criticized, but it’s a childhood favorite for many who were kids at the time of its release. Matthew Broderick is at his goofiest as a security guard who is transformed into a part-robot equipped with a nearly endless supply of quirky gadgets and whirligigs—perfect for thwarting the evil Claw, a business tycoon who just wants to cause chaos in Riverton and steal other scientists’ work.<br></p><p><em>Inspector Gadget</em> is jam-packed with over-the-top, zany violence ranging from punches to explosions and chaotic traffic pile-ups—and even boasts a surprising amount of sexual innuendo, such as a rocket that shoots from Gadget’s hat when a woman gets close to him. Much of this juvenile humor and wacky antics, shot in a frenetic style, can feel cringey and headache-inducing—especially for older viewers. Younger audiences, however, are sure to get a kick out of it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2b797b5c89d7b6988e7fc1a388f6bc4" data-recommend-id="image://b2b797b5c89d7b6988e7fc1a388f6bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Andrew the robot looks off-camera.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Bicentennial Man</em> can be a frustrating watch because it jumps back and forth between playful humor and weepy melodrama. A family in the future hires a robot to help with household tasks, from cooking dinner to entertaining the children. The robot, Andrew, has a shiny metallic exterior that’s very smooth and polished, and the design of his face closely resembles that of late, great actor Robin Williams, which is charming but a little bit creepy. Andrew develops a close bond with the family through his snappy dialogue, witty observations, and flair for the theatrical—all Robin Williams’ trademarks.<br></p><p>The family realizes their robot is very special and not just a mindless machine. Like many tales of artificial figures dating back to 1940’s <em>Pinocchio</em>, <em>Bicentennial Man</em> revolves around Andrew’s desire to become an ordinary man. His character explores what it means to be human through creative pursuits like playing the piano and falling in love. Even though it suffers from genre confusion and oversentimentality, in some ways <em>Bicentennial Man </em>was ahead of its time. It raises interesting questions about how smart artificial intelligence can really get, while also reminding us of humanity’s beauty and complexity. Plus, it includes enough silliness to keep younger audiences entertained.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4505bdafe8f05a3ee3e13d1d2db0fdf9" data-recommend-id="image://4505bdafe8f05a3ee3e13d1d2db0fdf9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two robots stand side-by-side.

The buildings look like machine switches and are made of circular gears, resembling the inside of a giant clock. The movie’s cast is stacked with stars including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Amanda Bynes, and Drew Carey, along with comedy legends Mel Brooks and Robin Williams. While some of the kid-friendly humor, like Aunt Fanny’s giant robot bottom and an elaborate dance scene set to James Brown’s “Get Up Offa That Thing,” can feel a bit cheesy, much of the script is filled with clever humor that everyone can enjoy.<br></p><p>The anti-corporate story centers on a company that would rather make shiny new robots and leave the clunky, rusted ones broken and obsolete. Kids will enjoy the vibrant futuristic designs and the level of detail and diversity put into all these different robot creations, all topped off with a heartwarming message: “You can shine no matter what you’re made of.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="414314bc9dcf9964dbd52be22e06770f" data-recommend-id="image://414314bc9dcf9964dbd52be22e06770f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Optimus Prime and Megatron stand together.

Based on the beloved 1980s toys, the series features an alien race of robots transported to Earth who can turn into everyday vehicles and machines. While this premise still excites young kids who love the toys’ adjustable transformations, most films in the franchise since Michael Bay’s 2007 adaptation have been bloated and confusing messes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612?_gl=1*1jtgjt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NDEzMC4xODQuMS4xNzI3Mzc3NDk1LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612?_gl=1*1jtgjt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NDEzMC4xODQuMS4xNzI3Mzc3NDk1LjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Transformers One</em></a></span> is an unexpected surprise, a sweet animated story about the brotherly love Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) and Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry) shared before they became enemies.

Hiro Hamada is a robotics whiz kid (and a bit of a rebel because he hosts illegal robot fights) who inspires younger audiences to pursue their passions. He lives with Baymax, a puffy white robot with a gentle expression that looks like a giant marshmallow, who was a caregiver for Hiro’s deceased brother, Tadashi Hamada. <em>Big Hero 6</em> is an action-packed and exciting blend of superhero adventures and robotic technology. Hiro uses his innovative inventions to transform Baymax and his colorful group of friends into tech-powered heroes. At its core, however, is a touching story of grief.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="681d570501bca369c03005c5f6b2c1e6" data-recommend-id="image://681d570501bca369c03005c5f6b2c1e6" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eve lights a light bulb while WALL-E looks on.

WALL-E is the cutest little robot you’ve ever seen—short and shaped like a box, with gigantic, binocular-like eyes. He’s dingy and beat-up, spending his days sorting through and picking up trash on a garbage-ridden Earth. Meanwhile, humans live on spaceships, glued to their Hoverchairs while gorging on television and snacks.<br></p><p>EVE, WALL-E’s love interest, looks like an Apple product with a chic, high-gloss body and state-of-the-art technology. Their romance is as sweeping as the Golden Age Hollywood musicals WALL-E loves to watch. The adventures they share across the galaxy are funny, action-packed, and emotional. It’s fascinating and touching to observe these wordless robots interact with each other; although they are machines, they have so much heart and soul.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e08d9d15b42fef1f5f80d5cc76aa3dc" data-recommend-id="image://6e08d9d15b42fef1f5f80d5cc76aa3dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Iron Giant holds Hogarth in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Iron Giant holds Hogarth in his hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

The main character, Hogarth Hughes, is a lonely boy with a working-class mom who discovers a towering robot in the woods. Hogarth quickly forms a deep friendship with the gigantic creature, whose glowing round eyes and lined mouth communicate a kind smile. They race through the chilly Maine wilderness, with the Giant even cannonballing into a lake to create a tidal wave, while Hogarth desperately tries to stop him from munching on every car he encounters.<br></p><p><em>The Iron Giant </em>evokes another childhood classic, <em>E.T</em>.,  with its plot point of government agents investigating the reports of this “monster” who may possibly be a Russian creation. These tensions and Cold War anxieties culminate in one of the most moving finales in animation. Even in the few lines he delivers, voice actor Vin Diesel brings such emotional depth to the Giant and how much he cares for Hogarth, demonstrating that he is so much more than just a machine. The ending makes it feel as though <em>The Iron Giant</em> has reached in, ripped out your heart, and stomped on it. A true classic. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beloved real-time strategy classics <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em> will soon be available in Microsoft's Game Pass subscription for PC, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/starcraft-game-pass/">announced</a> during the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>It's already free to play both <em>StarCraft</em> and <em>StarCraft II</em>'s multiplayer modes on PC. This move to Game Pass will make the equally excellent single-player campaigns available to anyone with a subscription, though. Game Pass will also offer all the expansions for both games.</p>
<p>The subscription will provide access to <em>StarCraft Remastered</em>, a revamped version of the original 1998 game that came out in 2017, as well as the <em>StarCraft II Campaign Collection</em>, which includes all 70-plus single-player missions from <em>StarCraft II</em>'s <em>Wings of Liberty</em>, <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, <em>Legacy of the Void</em>, and <em>Nova Covert Ops</em>.</p>
<p>The announcement was the lone bit of new information in a brief video by Xbox boss Phil Spencer. He appeared in the video wearing a <em>StarCraft</em> T-shirt, which might have gotten <em>StarCraft</em> fans' hopes up that the franchise would be getting a new game for the first time in over a decade.</p>
<p>That didn't happen, of course, but the games' addition to Game Pass will likely expose them to many new players who may have been too young to play the influential strategy titles when they debuted in 1998 and 2010.</p>
<p>These aren't the first Blizzard games to be added to Game Pass since Microsoft acquired Activision-Blizzard. First came <em>Diablo IV</em>, then <em>Overwatch 2</em>—the latter was free-to-play already by the time it came to Game Pass, but Microsoft included it in the Game Pass distribution platform and offered cosmetics and goodies to Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>The <em>StarCraft</em> games will launch for PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on November 5.</p>

			<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202409/18892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Famitsu</a> about the Nintendo Museum that is due to open on October 2, industry legend Shigeru Miyamoto made some interesting comments about Nintendo's uniqueness and its desire to stand apart from what he called the 'performance console war' between Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p><em>If the goal is to preserve all of Nintendo's past assets so that people can understand what Nintendo is, then it's not just about the employees; we now have people spanning three generations who know about Nintendo. It would be great if those people could see it and understand what Nintendo is. I hope that through this, people will understand and refrain from dragging Nintendo into competitions like the so-called 'console wars,' which focus on high specs and hardware performance (laughs). Nintendo will continue to use the various technologies available today to create things in a way that's unique to Nintendo. We're not just limited to games; we'll also be involved in films and will continue to create a variety of entertainment content. I thought this would be a good opportunity for people to understand that, and that's why we made this.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe the most important thing is for various people to visit this museum and come away thinking, 'This is a company that's not at all related to the game industry competition or cutting-edge technology that people usually talk about.' Of course, we conduct technology research. In the past, analysts and others have said things like, 'Why isn't Nintendo focusing on networking?' or 'What about mobile?' or 'Why aren't you using cutting-edge chips?' However, if people calmly look at the exhibits, they'll realize that we've actually been working on those things all along. But Nintendo has a history of waiting for the right moment to release products, only commercializing them when we believe the timing is perfect. I think that becomes clear through the museum, and it helps build trust in Nintendo. For our shareholders as well, this serves as a kind of mid-to-long-term perspective, showing that they can trust us to manage the company properly.</em></p>
<p>With the unveiling of the Switch 2 believed to be imminent (the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to have already entered full production), Miyamoto's comments may be interpreted as a way to prepare fans when the official specifications have been revealed. Indeed, from the leaks and rumors, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be even less powerful than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nintendo has long since detached itself from the aforementioned 'performance console war'. The last time the Japanese company produced a console as powerful as its competitors was with the GameCube, which was unsuccessful commercially. Following that experience, Nintendo avoided fighting Nintendo and Sony in raw computing power and designed its consoles with specific gimmicks, such as motion controls for the Wii, the gamepad/touchscreen for the WiiU, and the hybrid handheld/home console for the Switch. Two out of three times, they were right; we'll see if whatever they come up with for the Nintendo Switch 2 will be a success or not.</p>

            <p>Indie publisher Hooded Horse have been on a roll of late, publishing wonderful strategy games like Manor Lords, Against The Storm and Cataclismo. Good news, then, that they're currently running a publisher sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hoodedhorsepublishersale2024">over on Steam</a> where those games and many others in their library are discounted.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They've also just published Direct Horse, an excellently-named showcase of upcoming updates and recently announced games. Unfortunately the showcase itself is 16 minutes of excruciating sub-sub-sub Devolver faux-VHS faux-jokes, but you can subject yourself to it below.
