            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bluepoint Games, the PlayStation first-party team involved in the remakes of console exclusives like <a href="https://kotaku.com/demons-souls-on-ps5-has-still-got-it-1845648877"><em>Demon’s Souls</em></a> and<a href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1822531522"><em> Shadow of the</em> <em>Colossus</em>,</a> is closing in March, a source tells <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p>As first reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mfaauf5pek2b"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>, the move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released its last project, a launch exclusive for the PlayStation 5. It was also a support studio on 2022’s <i>God of War Ragnarök</i>.</p> <p>The Texas-based studio was acquired by Sony only a few years ago in 2021 and was most recently working on a live-service project. That game, which was reportedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">a multiplayer <em>God of War</em> spin-off</a>, was canceled early in 2025.</p> <p>Fans had been hoping for years that Sony would use Bluepoint Games to revive other PlayStation classics, including the PS4 exclusive <em>Bloodborne</em>. Throwing it onto a live service project was baffling to many, but of a piece with the PS5 maker’s disastrous campaign to create online multiplayer hits internally.</p>

 <p>Bluepoint Games was founded back in 2006 and its first game was a PSN downloadable shooter about fighting biological infections called <em>Blast Factor</em>. While that game never made the studio a household name, it quickly became a key player in helping Sony ship remasters of its back catalog. Bluepoint was responsible for the original <i>The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</i> on PS3 and getting <em>Gravity Rush</em> off of PS Vita and onto PS4.</p> <p>By last count, the studio employed roughly 70 people. It’s unclear if they are all getting laid off or if some of those developers will be shifted to other parts of PlayStation Studios.</p>

            <guid>1440859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embar</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">k Studios</a> has confirmed what’s making ‘Shrouded Sky’ so <strong>shrouded </strong>when the next major ARC Raiders update comes around in just a few days. The next update hits <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> on February 24th, introducing a new small-scale ARC enemy, a map overhaul, some new quests, an Expedition Project, and a <strong>new map condition</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans have been racking their brains trying to think of what the new map condition could be, but Embark Studios has finally confirmed it. The world outside Speranza is about to be rocked by a hurricane.</p>







<h2 id="h-hurricanes-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Hurricanes Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Embark Studios has confirmed what’s coming on February 24th with Shrouded Sky, focusing on the new map condition. Based on the data available, we always thought it would be a ‘Toxic Swamp’ map condition, but that might be lined up for a later update.</p>



<p>For now, we’re getting <strong>Hurricane</strong>.</p>



<p>This will change the game’s weather and physics, introducing powerful winds that heavily impact players as they explore the maps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The wind will change how you navigate topside. When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Debris will fly around at breakneck speed, striking the player and causing their shields to glitch. Embark has advised that you might prefer to remove your shield entirely, as the bits and pieces flying around will make your shield degrade and spark, making you <strong>very </strong>visible.</p>



<p>Further, visibility will take a huge hit in Shrouded Sky under the Hurricane map condition. Players will find themselves enveloped by thick mists that make spotting ARC and other Raiders almost impossible. That, combined with the ‘howling winds’, means that navigating the maps will be much tougher than usual.</p>



<p>The gem of the Hurricane map condition is a new stack of First Waves Caches, buried boxes containing rare relics that have been unearthed by the violent winds and harrowing rain.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that PlayStation has decided to shut down Bluepoint Games. </p>



<p>Bluepoint Games has been instrumental in enhancing past titles for the current-gen consoles, including Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection and Shadow of the Colossus. The team was also responsible for bringing us the PlayStation 5 remake of Demon’s Souls. Now, the studio has been closed down. </p>

<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>&nbsp;report, PlayStation has decided to close Bluepoint Games, leading to the dismissal of approximately 70 employees from a total of 80.

      <p>I have a nice little NAS that I got before the pandemic. NAS stands for “Network Attached Storage;” it’s basically a baby server you shove hard drives into and connect to your router. A NAS is a wonderful thing to have, as it makes the process of storing your files and having them accessible much easier without involving a cloud storage company. You can run a streaming service like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Jellyfin</a> or Plex for all your friends, or a music streaming service like <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Navidrome.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been meaning to replace my NAS for a while; she’s a loyal soldier but is at capacity and struggles on 4k videos. I was planning on doing this as an Aftermath piece, but then I looked at the prices of spinning disk drives, which are now twice what I paid for them–just like SSDs, and just like RAM, just like GPUs before them. Despite the world I live in, I love the computer, and I am tired of these useless AI dipshits making the computers expensive.</p><p>It has been a historically bad time to buy any computer that is not a Mac mini since about mid September. Sure, the pandemic was bad, but there was a rational enough reason for shortages (untold sickness on a global scale). Price hikes in RAM are entirely thanks to the Y Combinator-brained jackasses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/ram-and-storage-is-ridiculously-expensive-right-now-because-of-drumroll-ai-of-course-and-theres-little-reason-to-think-prices-will-drop-any-time-soon/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pushing AI into everything</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Quick question: is that good?

If you bought a stick of RAM in September and flipped it you could make more than most stocks.&nbsp;</p><p>The other component of this is that there are functionally three companies that produce this stuff at scale and which dominate the market–SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung–and they kind of don’t give a shit if they sell to Sam Altman or you. But before you get mad, they want you to know that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/micron-says-its-not-to-blame-for-its-high-memory-prices-theres-just-not-enough-supply-to-go-around/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>it isn’t their fault</u></a> and that this was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/samsung-estimates-record-breaking-usd13-billion-profits-and-says-memory-apocalypse-tainted-prices-are-inevitable/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>inevitable</u></a> as their stock shot straight up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837594/crucial-ram-ssd-micron-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Micron shuttered Crucial</u></a>, their consumer-facing RAM brand, in December to focus on AI.

What’s worse, this has also come for flash memory as well, and as a guy who had to go to Microcenter and pay twice as much as he would have in August for an M.2 SSD, it’s rough out there. Guess what else uses RAM? Graphics cards! And while prices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zVc4Ke6yDo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>did briefly crash</u></a>, they are now shooting back up just in time for, to quote Steve Burke of Gamer’s Nexus, an “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEc_YBXmeY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>inevitable opportunity to screw consumers</u></a>”.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueEc_YBXmeY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Presenting: Inevitable Opportunity to Screw Consumers | GPU Pricing Update"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Thanks Steve.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Simplifying the impact of this to video games is a bit like explaining geopolitics to Americans in terms of burgers, but unfortunately it is dire for gaming hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/879845/valve-steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock-memory-storage-ram-crisis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steam Decks</u></a> are currently out of stock, with Valve citing the AI crunch. As we previously reported, <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-machine-frame-delayed-ai-data/"><u>the Steam Machine has been delayed because stupid little babies can’t stop using AI to write their emails</u></a>. The Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/879668/sony-playstation-nintendo-switch-2-console-memory-shortage?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might go up in price,</u></a> and Sony’s plans for the next iteration of the PlayStation might get <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pushed back</u></a>, but don’t worry because the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increases-monetizing-install-base/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>PS5 could also get expensive</u></a>. The Raspberry Pi, the teensy little computer nerds put in their house to do dork tasks like block ads, has gone up in price <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836221/raspberry-pi-price-increases-ram-costs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not once</u></a> but now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/872393/raspberry-pi-price-increase-ram-shortage-costs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>twice.</u></a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/850376/framework-ram-memory-ddr5-price-hikes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Framework</u></a> has announced multiple hikes on its laptops.

Even outside of what we consider consumer electronics, RAM is in so many things that aren’t just phones and laptops that this could get very nasty quite quickly.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jtp.bsky.social/post/3mdki23tso22v?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Jenny Tightpants </span></a></figcaption></figure><p>And for what? For a speculative bubble that is so clearly unsustainable that you would have to have psychosis to believe it could ever pay out? So that the<a href="https://youtu.be/9A-eeJP0J7c?si=koS0YKiJEYZdGm6T&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> notoriously corrupt memory industry</u></a> can get in on this boom before everything craters? Proponents of AI only want to talk about the utility of these things because Claude got slightly better at making the code that they are paid to write. But none of these people want to talk about the externalities attached to making mildly better agentic AI that still fucks up an unacceptable amount, and when they do they sound either profoundly gullible, disingenuous, uninterested or like they’re logged into their Vanguard profile while they’re talking to you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3mez224lpkc2x?ref=aftermath.site"><u><span>Rami Ismail (رامي)</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>I would be blissfully happy if I never had to talk about AI ever again. Unfortunately I am compelled to think about this because it’s fucking up computers, and I deeply love computers. I grew up making computers. I went to summer camp for computers (like twice, I’m not kidding). I love writing about computers and telling people why I find them special with all my heart. I enjoy jailbreaking closed hardware that would otherwise become e-waste, like robot vacuums and Amazon devices, and giving them a second life as something ethical. I love solder and burning rosin, and getting a fresh stack of PCBs sent to me from a factory. I love to create a machine from parts, and my heart overflows with joy when that machine does exactly what I want it to do, despite every multinational company stuffing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with shit I never asked for</u></a>.</p><p>The rabid adherents of AI – not those who feel compelled to use it for work, but the ones who won’t shut the fuck up about it – are too blinkered, greedy, or ignorant to see the writing on the wall. They do not love computers; maybe they never did. They love money and having a mistake-prone LLM do their work for them. They love <a href="https://fortune.com/article/why-does-jensen-huang-nvidia-wear-black-leather-jackets-revenge-of-the-nerds/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>increasingly ugly leather jackets</u></a>. They fear falling behind their peers, and would do anything to keep up no matter the impact on the world. They love the insular fascist tech culture that radiates like a cancer from the Bay Area, a once vibrant and interesting place made foul by their presence. They love offloading their tasks to something mimicking a human voice, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/what-is-claude-anthropic-doesnt-know-either?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">scaring themselves into thinking it has personhood</a> despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/827820/large-language-models-ai-intelligence-neuroscience-problems?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the entire premise being flawed from the jump.</u></a> They love deskilling themselves in real time and fooling themselves into thinking they’re Albert Einstein 2.&nbsp;</p><p>And that would be bad enough if they kept it in a nasty little Discord server, but like libertarianism, crypto, and NFTs before it, they just refuse to shut the fuck up about it. It’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/" rel="noreferrer">an endless torrent of tortured blogs</a> delivered in an inhuman chorus of the same mockery of a voice. Who are they trying to convince, me or themselves? Why do they need <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee/"><u>my validation</u></a>? To quote the great ethicist Carl Brutananadilewski, “Go away, go away. So tired of this. Friggen go away you freak.” and “What do you need? What do you want? Can I not just live here without occasionally having to deal with you animals?”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gR3bx0HlTMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="So Tired Of This"></iframe></figure><p>I just want to build my computers in peace. <a href="https://aftermath.site/xteink-x4-cheap-hackable-ereader-crosspoint-review/"><u>Simpler</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/digita-audio-player-snowsky-echo-mini-fiio-hyby/"><u>tech</u></a> is <a href="https://www.hilli.tech/nerds-are-fighting-to-bring-back-gadgets-even-as-iphone-wants-them-dead/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">nice</a>, but it’s not a total solution to this. I want to build a new NAS, to tend to it, to manage its Docker Compose file like a garden. I want to make more <a href="https://aftermath.site/opnsense-proxmox-diy-router-topton-cwwk-ap-mikrotik/"><u>Proxmox nodes</u></a> and have them do my little tasks in unison. I want to pull my hair out for hours trying to get a machine to do something like I’m training an unruly dog, only to find a simple solution that a living, breathing person wrote. I want more decommissioned 22TB Exos X22 hard drives that I can shove into a box I’ve frankensteined together, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc/"><u>so I can save the media that I love</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Eternal Darkness</strong> and <strong>Legacy of Kain</strong> creator <strong>Denis Dyack</strong> shared a lot of interesting thoughts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYlGJiZeT5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a two-hour-long interview with KiwiTalkz</a>, in which he addressed <strong>the lack of optimization of many Unreal Engine 5 games</strong>. You might remember that his upcoming game, <strong>Deadhaus Sonata</strong>, was powered by the <strong>Amazon Lumberyard</strong> engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadhaus-sonata-qa-denis-dyacks-quest-to-bring-narrative-to-the-online-space-through-genvids-interactive-streaming-and-the-power-of-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we last talked to him a few years ago</a>. Well, Dyack's studio went through several engine changes before eventually landing on Epic's technology after <strong>patching things up with the company following their previous dispute over Too Human</strong>.</p>



<p>Now a user of the leading game-making tool, Dyack <strong>pointed the finger at the current state of the industry</strong>, largely absolving the engine itself and adding that <strong>most game companies do not really even have time to optimize games anymore</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Most people who use Unreal Engine 5 have very large teams and those very large teams have a lot of people who know one specific part of what they do. <strong>There is an artist that all they do are blades of grass. They optimize for the blades of grass, but they have no idea what's happening in the other systems.</strong> And when you have two, 300, maybe a thousand people working on these systems, they're all going in their own directions and they're all doing whatever they can to make the game the best. And to have technological oversight of all of these things is very difficult. </em></p>



<p><em>A lot of these teams have some very experienced people, but a lot of them are not that experienced. They're coming in with two to five years. And I've been in the industry now for 35 years, built my own engines. <strong>At the end of the day, optimization is really hard</strong>. When you have an all-around engine like Unreal Engine 5, it's going to be good at everything. But if you're going to make a racing game versus an open world RPG versus a 2D game, <strong>the optimizations are extremely different, and you have to know your game to get in there and optimize it</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>The sad reality of the video game industry right now is <strong>it's in such poor shape that most companies don't even have time to optimize</strong>. The game's working, they ship it, it gets out there, and they haven't spent any time optimizing it, and it runs like hell. It's not the engine's fault. It's actually the state of the industry. Since we talked last, t<strong>here have been a few Black Swan events and also what I would call an extinction-level event as well</strong>. The ramifications of the extinction-level event are still happening. A lot of my colleagues are gone and a lot of the money that used to be in the industry is gone. We're going to continue to see over the next 2 to 3 years, maybe 4, a lot of the relics of the mistakes that were made before continue to happen until a lot of that gets fixed up. </em></p>



<p><em>But what it means is if you're going to optimize a game, you're not putting in any content, and all you're doing is trying to make it run faster and be better. <strong>There are a lot of people who think that's not worth it. Just put more content in, get people excited about all the new stuff in the game, and, you know, forget optimization</strong>. So, my opinion is it's definitely not the engine's fault. It's more of the state of the industry.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, Dyack clarified what he meant by "extinction-level event". He was referring to the infamous "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformative $2 billion deal</a></strong>" that the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> was negotiating with the <strong>Savvy Group</strong> before <strong>it fell through at the last minute</strong> in May 2023. Embracer Group's stock crashed, but that was just the beginning. Over the following months and years, Embracer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to sell off</a> most of its many studios</strong>, recouping what capital it could while keeping only a small number in its portfolio. </p>



<p>This, in turn, meant that when Embracer started liquidating its studios and shelving its projects, <strong>all those prototypes, built with tens of millions of dollars of Embracer's substantial capital, suddenly flooded the market as publishers scrambled to pick up new titles</strong>. These were demos built with budgets that independent developers could never match. They looked exceptional precisely because enormous amounts of money had already been poured into them.</p>



<p>Every publisher and platform holder looked at this sudden influx of polished, well-funded prototypes and naturally gravitated toward them. <strong>The pipeline of publishing slots filled up fast</strong>, while<strong> independent developers who had been going through the normal process of pitching their own, often far more modestly produced prototypes, got pushed further and further back in the queue</strong>. In many cases, these small studios <strong>simply ran out of money before they ever reached the front</strong>. </p>



<p>According to Dyack, <strong>50 to 70% of independent and mid-sized developers are now gone entirely</strong>, and in most instances, they were studios that had been running for several years, if not decades. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dyack expressed gratitude that his team, Apocalypse Studios, is still up and running amid this widespread catastrophe. On that note, he provided some news about Deadhaus Sonata: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo is available for download now via Steam</a></strong>, and the goal is to <strong>launch an early access version of the game later this year</strong> at $19.99. This initial version will only feature the vampire class, but more content will be added over the course of the 18-month-long early access, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>7 Total Playable Classes</li>



<li>New Areas, Dungeons, Towers, and other locations.</li>



<li>Hundreds of Tarot Cards and Inscriptions</li>



<li>Additional challenges and achievements that will grant the most powerful Inscriptions</li>



<li>Community-generated Content tools that integrate directly into the game, allowing Gamers to Create Content within the Deadhaus Sonata world. The community will be able to create Dungeons, Campaigns, Cities, Specific Items, Stories Lines</li>



<li>Character Customization Options</li>



<li>Enemy Types and Bosses</li>



<li>Additional Stories and Quest lines</li>



<li>Voice acting, dialogue, in-game cinematics</li>



<li>Social Features like text chat and voice chat</li>
</ul>



<p>The full version of Deadhaus Sonata <strong>will be free-to-play with cosmetic microtransactions for monetization</strong>.</p>

<p>The wonders of Paldea</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You know we're closing in on the end of the month when The Pokémon Company lifts the lid on its next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> booster set, and today, we've got just that.</p>
<p>The Paldean Wonder themed booster packs will arrive in the app next week on <strong>26th February</strong> from <strong>1am GMT / 2am CET / 5pm PT (25th)</strong>. As you'd expect from that name, this set is all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>'s Gen IX and the Paldea region.</p>
<p>New Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly cards will be up for grabs, obviously, but the reveal has also given us a first look at a fresh full art Maushold, as well as two new Meowscarada and Gholdengo ex cards. Here's a closer look at a handful of the newbies:</p>


<p>It'll kick off what's likely to be quite a big week for Pokémon news. We're expecting the annual Pokémon Presents presentation on its usual date of 27th February, and with the 30th anniversary taking place this year, our fingers are crossed that it's going to be a big one.</p>

              <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>is probably right behind </span><i><span>Toy Story 4 </span></i><span>on the list of movie sequels we didn’t need, but the movie’s first trailer feels surprisingly timely and relevant in the age of AI threatening everyone’s jobs because rich people keep insisting it’s the future.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>Pixar’s latest tale of toys and tablets</span></a><span> is coming to theaters on June 19, and picks up with most of Andy’s old toys living with their new owner Bonnie, who was first introduced as a toddler in </span><i><span>Toy Story 3</span></i><span>. She’s a little bit older now and she’s less interested in dolls and action figures than she is in the shiny new tablet her parents bought her. Like all the toys, Lilypad (voiced by </span><i><span>Past Lives </span></i><span>star Greta Lee) is a sentient object in the </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>universe, and she isn’t holding back about her intentions to replace Bonnie’s obsolete toys as her favorite plaything. A lot of kids are killing time with screens these days, so it’s a good, suitable setup for a </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>movie in 2026, even if this series should have ended twice already.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The trailer also reveals why Woody, who left the group to be with his long-lost love Bo Peep at the end of </span><i><span>Toy Story 4</span></i><span>, is returning for this outing. He seems to have been in contact with his old friends via a walkie talkie, and when he gets word that big tech is invading the playroom, he returns to try and help. The cowboy toy is starting to show some wear and tear, though, as he now has a bald spot where the brown paint of his “hair” has worn away over time. It’s a good bit.</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>  <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>isn’t the only Pixar movie coming out this year, as the </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-esque </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a> <span>is coming to theaters on March 6. It is, however, the first in a line of sequels the company has announced, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-incredibles-jack-black-regrets-passing-on-syndrome-villian-role-pixar-2000656750"><i><span>The Incredibles 3</span></i></a><span> and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> also in development and just as unnecessary as a fifth </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>.</span></p>

<p>Most members of The Seven were taken over by The Herald’s Chrome in Chapter 3, Season 4. They were absent from the game for nearly 3 years before the February road map revealed their return. </p>



<p>One of the members of the group, The Order, returned to the game as part of a January 2026 update. Now, at least, it’s known that The Visitor is returning, with Ben Starr providing the voice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has cast Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 actor Ben Starr as a key in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> character, following in the footsteps of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Brie Larsen and Joel McHale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starr's turn as dashing Clair Obscur hero Verso is arguably his most famous role to date, and earned him a second nomination for best performer at both last year's Game Awards and the forthcoming BAFTA Game Awards. You may also have heard his vocal talents as Clive in Final Fantasy 16 and Prometheus in Hades 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Starr's set to star in Fortnite as The Visitor, one of the game's key NPC characters who will finally rejoin the battle royale mode's storyline (and speak!) later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Visitor is one of Fortnite's heroic Seven, a band of intergalactic heroes who often turn up to save the day during its memorable live events. Indeed, the character of the Visitor was actually the focus of the game's very first live event — 2018's rocket launch — although he has seldom been heard, until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, players were introduced to more of the Seven, including its lead member The Foundation (played by Johnson), The Scientist (McHale), The Paradigm (Larsen), The Origin (Rahul Kohli), The Imagined (Cherami Leigh) and The Order (Laura Bailey). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being written out of the game's story in 2022, players were reintroduced to the team following the events of last year's climactic Zero Hour finale, which also featured a recap video setting up Fortnite's current Chapter 7 era — offering a quick reminder of who the Seven were and what they were up against. You can watch that again just above.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m joining Fortnite as The Visitor.</p><p>I’m so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven. I imagine I’ll be very normal about it. <a href="https://t.co/cUNBkr2gWG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cUNBkr2gWG</a></p></div>— Ben Starr (@The_Ben_Starr) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, not all of the Seven are still standing, and Starr's incarnation of The Visitor is a different one to the original. In a clever twist, the game's OG mode, which offers Fortnite's original battle royale map, is considered a separate multiversal reality. It's from here that Starr's version of The Visitor will arrive in the coming days — following the OG version of that original rocket event — in order to help save the day and speak for the first time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Fortnite update included datamined dialogue lines where Starr's voice is unmistakable. Long-term Fortnite fans will also be pleased to hear the return of the Seven's AI assistant AMIE, who sounds like she is once again voiced by the prolific voice actress Erica Lindbeck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm joining Fortnite as The Visitor," Starr <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> today on Twitter/X.

            <p>
God of War actor Christopher Judge, the rumbling voice behind beardy Kratos, has suggested more news on the series' future could arrive "late summer".
</p>
<p>
Judge shared the information during a signing session at Canada's Fan Expo, where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM">words were captured</a> (it's unclear if was aware he was being recorded) by streamer Fuzhpuzy. In the video, Judge confirmed he won't be lending his vocal talents to Sony Santa Monica's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently announced God of War Greek trilogy remakes</a> - Kratos actor TC Carson will return for those, he claimed - but he did tease other news is coming.
</p>
<p>
According to Judge, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kratos-is-now-played-by-stargate-sg-1s-christopher-judge">voiced Kratos since 2018's God of War</a>, fans will "be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer", suggesting Sony Santa Monica might be ready to unveil a follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> later this year. That, though, is far from a certainty, and it's possible Judge is working  with the studio in another capacity.
</p>
<p>
As yet, the most substantial hint toward Sony Santa Monica's next project emerged last year, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier teased</a> the studio's "next big thing" - headed up by long-time God of War director and producer Cory Balrog - won't be a new IP, but "might feel like one".
</p><p>
"Maybe that's why people are confused," Schreier wrote in response to rumours surrounding the studio's next project. "Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum." He also noted "the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."
</p>
<p>
Could this be a radical reinvention of the God of War series or something else entirely? If Judge is correct, perhaps we'll learn more later this year. And what about Sony Santa Monica's "new IP", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">hinted at by a developer</a> last August? Mysteries upon mysteries! But until more is revealed, there's always Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently released spin-off Sons of Sparta</a> to sate your God of War needs. And don't forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">there's a TV show on the way</a> too.

<p>Well this is a nice surprise! Nintendo popped up out of the blue today to announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. The real treat? It's available <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, you can now head over to the eShop and pick up the latest addition to the 'Switch 2 Edition' roster for £54.99 / $64.99 (or £4.19 / $4.99, if you already own it on Switch 1). There's no new content to speak of this time, but you can expect to see things running at a smooth 60fps, with a crisp 4K resolution in docked mode — assuming your TV offers it.</p>
<p>Naturally, you might be wondering what this upgrade looks like compared to the Switch 1 version. Well, wonder no more, because we've got you covered. In the above video, Mr Alex Olney showcases the two versions running side by side for a neat cutscene comparison, before highlighting just how smoothly things perform in open world exploration and combat.</p>
<p>It's a marked improvement, we must admit, even if the 60fps boost has been rumoured for just about as long as the game has been on Switch. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got some mech exploring (<em>mechsploring?</em>) to do.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>1440694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Ubisoft Toronto</strong> team is at the helm of what is arguably one of <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> most significant projects, the long-awaited <strong>Splinter Cell Remake</strong>, and they're also the most recent team to get hit by the <strong>mass layoffs</strong> that Ubisoft has been conducting as part of its recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"> "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>."</a> This is Ubisoft's fourth layoff announcement in 2026.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs to Wccftech in a statement that marked this layoff as part of a "<em>final phase</em>" of the company's global cost-saving efforts. The company also confirmed that development of the Splinter Cell Remake continues at the studio, alongside its work on <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> and its co-development projects.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement Ubisoft sent to Wccftech:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Following the&nbsp;recent&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;of the&nbsp;final phase of&nbsp;Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the&nbsp;discontinuation&nbsp;of&nbsp;projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be <strong>reducing its workforce by 40 roles</strong>.</em> <em>This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected.&nbsp;Our priority now is to support&nbsp;them&nbsp;through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;The Toronto studio continues development on the Splinter Cell game and serves as a co-development partner on Rainbow Six, along with supporting additional co-development projects.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was first confirmed all the way back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">December 2021</a>, after years of hopes and prayers from fans of the franchise that Ubisoft would one day return to it. While remakes always have the potential to make fans nervous since they're inherently always a bit of an attempt at recapturing lightning in a bottle, the ideal scenario where fans old and new get to enjoy a beloved game that also sparks development on new projects in that series is almost always too tempting to pass up.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/">But it's been years</a> since we've had any real update on the project's status, and despite rumours that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">aiming for a 2026 release</a>, the company's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">organizational restructuring</a> and the fate of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/"> <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong></a> point to Splinter Cell fans having to wait a lot longer for some good Splinter Cell-related news.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this remake doesn't go the way of Sands of Time. The most recent significant update on the project arrived in December 2025, when it was spotted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-splinter-cell-remake-was-given-back-to-its-original-game-director/"><strong>David Grivel</strong> would be returning to the project as its game director</a>, after he initially left the role shortly after the project's reveal in 2021.</p>
