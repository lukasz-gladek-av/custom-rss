			<p>Given the significance of the UK in gaming development it is surprising how rare games set here are. Even those that do exist tend to be either quaint backdrops like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/12/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/">Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</a> or ‘ye olde’ period pieces like Chivalry. Hollowbody breaks this trend by being set in a future dystopian version of an abandoned British city; taking this uncannily familiar location and using it to produce a love letter to classic survival horror. The resulting title is up there with the very best of indie survival horror games and feels like a lost classic from the PS2 era.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollowbody  - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9vRLnwYO14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve been following the development of Hollowbody for a couple of years and developer Headware Games has done a great job in chronicling the process of indie game production through their social media presence. I get a real kick out of this kind of information and seeing a game develop from early prototype through pre-release demos and finally the finished build is always a joy. From the very beginning Hollowbody has had a clear vision and a distinctive aesthetic and this has ensured that the final game is successful, both as its own thing and as homage to past greats.</p>


<p>The futuristic setting of Hollowbody feels like a banal Blade Runner – Edge Jogger, maybe? – complete with flying cars and neon skies. Everything feels like the future except, of course, for the exclusion zone, the site of a mysterious outbreak that left a twenty mile area sealed off for the wider population’s protection. The only people to venture into the exclusion area are never heard from again. Until, that is, your partner Sasha heads in to find out what happened and you have to go in to find her. The background takes in equal parts Resident Evil, Contagion, and Escape from New York and immediately established a clear narrative and emotional reason for Mica risking her life and I appreciated the generally understated but drip-fed nature of the story-telling here. No lengthy expositions or overloading but instead notes and uncanny radio interference combine to offer suggestions but not solutions as to what happened.</p>


<p>Visually, Hollowbody is superb. The PS2 era design looks fantastic, especially as you can up the resolution if you wish to achieve the kind of result that is normally only possible when upscaling PS2 titles via emulation. The world-building is similarly great and the early environments you explore felt eerily familiar but with a dark and deadly twist. Sound design is also a highpoint here as the atmospheric audio ensures that you are always on edge and occasional stabs of music at key events jar you into action. The full voice acting is totally off brand with the genre classics though, as it is actually excellent throughout and often gives a real emotional hit.</p>
<p>Streamlining the classic survival horror form, Hollowbody retains the mechanics and feel of the genre, but finetunes some aspects to avoid the usual frustration points. Rather than the limited inventory that is so ubiquitous in the genre (and which affected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a> to such a degree) here you can pick up everything you need and carry it with you. That being said, there is less to collect than in other games as the focus is on exploration and occasional puzzles, rather than overly intricate escape rooms.</p>

<p>Juggling weaponry is less of an issue than normal as you can equip one melee weapon and one firearm and can switch between them through shortcuts similar to those found in third person action combat games. Early on you’ll rely on a pistol and a plank with nails in it, but more powerful weapons are scattered around for you to find. In fact, some firearms are hinted at in the achievements but I didn’t find them in my first playthrough, suggesting areas I missed.</p>
<p>The opening stages of the game take place in the tower block that was featured in the demos, and I initially thought the whole game would involve making my way up to its heights. Fortunately the range of environments is much greater than this. You’ll find yourself exploring the residential areas more generally, a churchyard, and underground areas before you reach the end of the game.</p>

<p>One area with less variety, however, is the enemies you face. Whilst there are the stalwarts of lumbering zombies, horrifying dogs, and the occasional larger foe, the focus is clearly less on these than the narrative and world-building. Combat itself is solid and there is the expected risk and reward in terms of taking on foes or evading them whilst managing limited ammo. Indeed there are very few unavoidable enemies throughout, with only a few set piece moments forcing you to fight.</p>
<p>Puzzles are well designed, but not as constant as in some titles in the genre. The tower block in particular had quite a lot of rooms that had no gameplay purpose, but did add to the feel of dread and tragedy that pervades the game. One general tip for new players is to make sure that you examine and read the descriptions of items in your inventory as an early puzzle took me far too long to solve, as I hadn’t made the lateral connection to an item I was carrying all along. I would also recommend having a paper and pen on hand as there are a couple of moments where you need to collect information, and it is generally useful to make a note of puzzles you haven’t yet solved.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hollowbody does a great job of capturing the mood and feel of survival horror classics whilst removing some of the genre’s more annoying aspects and sits at the very top of the indie horror tree alongside the likes of Crow Country and Signalis.	</p></div>

			<p>Today, Inflexion Games released a new game overview trailer showcasing the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update for the gaslamp-fantasy PVE survival-crafting game. So far, Realms Rebuilt is the biggest update for Nightingale since its release in February 2024. Although the "all reviews" section for the game is tagged as Mixed, recent reviews are Mostly Positive, suggesting good things for those who have begun experimenting with the Realms Rebuilt update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt Update 0.5 - Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k91qf7lSEU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update adds a new handcrafted campaign that sends players exploring gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests and much more, as well as overhauling the crafting and progression system after listening to player feedback. To add more excitement to the game, new dungeons and boss battles have been added, as well as new weapons for players to experiment with and new challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>With the release of this update, Nightingale is currently 40% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store. The game is still in Early Access on PC, suggesting there is plenty more to come to make Nightingale a fully-fledged product.</p>
<p>"The Realms Rebuilt update is the culmination of all the invaluable feedback we've received from the community over the last several months of Early Access," says Aaryn Flynn, CEO of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightingale-director-isnt-worried-about-saturation-survival-is-having-a-moment-and-its-great-for-everyone/">Inflexion Games.</a> "We hope that it feels like a whole new Nightingale journey, improved and more immersive, whilst retaining the core elements that the community loves about adventuring through the realms."</p>
<p>To give the game more substance, the Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update includes a new parametric crafting system so that players can maximize the potential of their equipment, new dungeons and bosses so that players can test and experiment with their Realmwalker skills, as well as an expansive campaign. As explained above, the campaign takes players on a journey to reignite the Crossways to try and unlock the path back to humanity.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen this game, Nightingale is a PvE survival-crafting game where players have to discover, explore and survive in the Faewilds while working to overcome peculiar challenges set in a Victorian gaslamp fantasy world. The game allows players to play the game solo or team up with friends, allowing for a composition of up to five people. To explore new Realms, players will have to craft Realm Cards, as well as build their own estates to be able to survive in the aggressive world of Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt.</p>

That’s because in the late hours of the night, with a few drinks in everybody, there isn’t anything quite as fun as gathering around the TV and cracking stupid jokes facilitated via the series’ hilarious collection of minigames. Much of that comes down to the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>’s ease of use.</p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Jackbox </em>utilizes the most common device in existence today—our phones. While one person is required to own each pack on a console or PC, which is how you host games, the other players connect and play through their phones. It’s remarkably simple, and makes the mess of collecting enough controllers for a game of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-party-the-kotaku-review-1829480351"><em>Mario Party</em></a></span> or a match of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo</em></a></span><em> </em>a non-issue. The time between someone suggesting that we start a game of <em>Jackbox </em>and actually playing a game is miniscule. And the variety of games on offer means that you never get bored.</p><p>With the release of the <em>Naughty Pack</em>, there are now 11 collections of minigames available for <em>Jackbox</em>. What each minigame has in common is the use of player input, by which I mean that they all revolve around players typing in words, drawing cartoons, or voting in polls to decide the winner. Because of this, every round of a given game is unique, playing up the inside jokes and particular interests of the people playing. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fibbage"><em>Fibbage</em></a></span>—perhaps the quintessential <em>Jackbox </em>game—lets every player input a fake answer to a trivia prompt in the hopes of fooling their opponents. And sure, playing it that way can be fun, but it’s more fun to just turn these prompts into big jokes and vote on what is funniest. Playing to the group gets even more fun in <em>Fibbage: Enough About You</em>, which explicitly turns the game into a joke about the people playing.</p><p>If all of that sounds like the perfect recipe for a great party night you’d be right, and you’d be a fool to miss out on the current Steam sale, which ends on September 19. Every party pack is discounted, with some up to fifty percent off. If you just want to buy the whole package, it can be yours for $116.92, which might sound like a lot but is much lower than the usual $279.90 price tag. Trust me, it’s worth it for the hours of fun you and your friends will have. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There was big video game industry news this when Sony, after months of rumor and speculation, finally and officially unveiled the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The disc-free system is more powerful than the PS5 and boasts impressive technical specs. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">the reaction online</a> was mainly focused on its price tag: $700 USD. Many were left scratching their heads and wondering: <em>Who is this for?!</em></p><p>According to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, the console is targeted at the "price-insensitive PlayStation ultra enthusiast." He told GameSpot that, for this audience, the price point is "not a significant barrier" and that the market for the PS5 Pro represents only a "very smell portion" of the total PlayStation fanbase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The people who may be interested in purchasing a PS5 Pro are those who feel they "must have the latest and greatest PlayStation tech." Everyone knows someone who always buys the newest iPhone, after all. As Piscatella reminded us, plenty of people paid $1000+ for a base PS5 model in 2020 when the system came out through third-party sites due to shortages.</p><p>"And, according to Circana's Checkout service, PlayStation 5 already attracts the highest percentage of high-income household purchasers than other console platforms in the US," Piscatella said. "49% of PS5 hardware US buyers in the three-month period ending July 2024 had household incomes over $100k per year, as compared to 43% of Xbox Series buyers and 40% of Switch buyers."</p><p>Piscatella admitted the PS5 Pro price at $700 (and that's before tax and add-ons, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">like the $80 disc-drive</a>) is "expensive," but, again, it's not aimed at the everyday PlayStation player.</p><p>The analyst didn't have a firm prediction for the number of units the PS5 Pro could sell at launch, noting it would depend in part on the number of units available. That being said, Piscatella said he believes the PS5 Pro could make up 15%-20% of total PS5 consoles sold in the first two months after launch. That percentage should go down in the months after, he said.</p><p>Looking back at the PS4 Pro, Piscatella said the console made up about 13% of total lifetime PS4 unit sales and about 15% of lifetime PS4 dollar sales.</p><p>"I'm estimating PS5 Pro to finish the generation somewhere between 9-15% of total lifetime PS5 units, with a slightly higher percentage in dollars because of its higher price," he said.</p><p>$700 is a lot of money--there is no denying that, so Piscatella said he understands the "mixed" reaction online about the price tag in particular. But he pointed out that the reality of the video game market today demonstrates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-a-shift-to-more-expensive-games/1100-6526121/" data-ref-id="1100-6526121">people will pay more</a>.</p><p>"The console market is stratifying in many ways. Some games have $249 Collector's Editions, games often offer a few days of early access so long as someone is willing to pay $99.99+ for that game. Premium gamepads and headsets are offered at premium price points... The list goes on," he said.</p><p>There was a time when only one version of a game, one version of a controller, or one version of a console existed--but those days are gone. "Companies are trying to maximize the dollars they can generate from both price-sensitive and price-insensitive consumers. This has been a bit of a painful transition for many console fans. I get it, but it's where we're at, and this trend is not going to slow anytime soon," Piscatella said.</p><p>Piscatella's commentary largely matches up with what Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said earlier this week in an <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter.</a> He wrote that the PS5 Pro is aiming at the "enthusiast" audience, along with people who have yet to buy a PS5 at all and want to get the latest and best model.</p><p>Harding-Rolls, too, said he understands the "commentary" surrounding the PS5 Pro's hefty price tag, which is larger than the price gap between the PS4 and PS4 Pro when that system debuted in 2016.</p><p>"PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, general supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X)," Harding-Rolls said.

As a discipline, UX ensures that we keep our players at the center of our processes and solutions. We are here to help the team design the whole player experience, which includes—but is not limited to—UIs. This means that we have to approach the game from a holistic perspective, including a wide range of different disciplines in our work.</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a grand strategy game set in the Middle Ages, released in September 2020 and developed by Paradox Development Studio. Unlike many grand strategy games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is character-driven, with most game interactions filtered through the lens of a specific character. The game is also succession-based; the character you play as will typically have an heir, who you will play as after your demise. It's a grand strategy game in which you're free to set your own goals, with a world seen through a dynastic lens as opposed to a national one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is approaching its fourth birthday, a fact plainly visible by the presence of all the additional content that's been released since its launch. With this wealth of additional content adding complexity to the game, it's important for us to ensure that our players can understand how to use the systems we introduce. This isn't something we do by making our game mechanics simpler or easier, but by clearly communicating to the player how they can interact with various aspects of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A whole lot of things can happen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is one of the strengths of the game, but it also creates a whole host of edge cases that can be tricky to deal with. There's only so much control we can exert over the game once we set things in motion, and we want the introduction to the game to feel as genuine as possible, even if we're easing the player into things. For instance, what happens if the player character dies of pneumonia while you were trying to teach them about how they can recover from illnesses?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we unpause the game, anything can happen. Because of this, it'd be impossible to try to map out a decision tree of carefully structured tutorial prompts. Instead, we have to approach the game as an open-ended sandbox. We can try to guide the players, but ultimately they're the ones making the decisions, and we have to respect that. Besides, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is at its best when unexpected things happen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article will dive deep into the recent changes to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s main tutorial. What motivated us to try it out, why now, and how did we do it?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why make another tutorial?">Why make another tutorial?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a studio, we always aim to make our players want to play and enjoy the game more, which is a metric we measure through the number of monthly active users our game has. While expanding and updating the game can help us achieve this goal, it has also led to us introducing a number of new mechanics that aren't covered by the in-game tutorial. The telemetry data we gather shows that the tutorial has a significant impact on the retention rates of our players, despite the fact that it doesn't cover all the mechanics you'll need to know to succeed. All of this, coupled with a number of small pet peeves the UX department had with the tutorial as a whole, meant it was a good candidate for an experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of spending a large amount of time ideating and iterating on a perfect new tutorial, we thought a better approach would be to try an experiment in the form of a quicker, more concise tutorial. This way, we can gather data and feedback, which can help us better understand what kind of tutorialization works for our game. The hope is that this kind of initiative will help us understand how best to teach our players about new mechanics in upcoming releases. If the experiment turns out to be a success, that also means we've improved the gameplay experience for our new players, which is a nice added bonus.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the idea had been brewing for some time, an initiative from our game director and the marketing department focused on new player acquisition: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/crusader-kings-iii/legends-of-crusader-kings-iii">"Legends of Crusader Kings III</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">", seemed like an excellent opportunity to try it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="New player experience">New player experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of which, what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the new player experience in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like? This is quite the multilayered question, seeing as players come into the game with a variety of experiences. Have they played Paradox games before? Are they completely new to grand strategy games? Generally speaking, it's very easy to get overwhelmed when you start the game for the first time. This is something that we've been aware of for some time and also an aspect we thought we could at least attempt to mitigate through the introduction of a new tutorial.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key principle that we can utilize here is the idea of progressive disclosure. This is a fairly straightforward concept in interaction design, which posits that one way to make users feel like a complex interaction is easy to interact with is by adding complexity bit by bit. Progressively, if you will. This is something we can introduce into a tutorial by, for instance, only showing parts of the interface when you're first starting out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The process">The process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Starting out, it's important to understand what it is we're trying to solve. What are the tutorial's core problems? Why are they problems to begin with? How have we, or other designers, tried to solve these problems in the past? These are the fundamental questions that we try to answer in this phase of the design process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's important for us to not only tackle these questions through quantitative means, but also qualitatively. The data we gather through telemetry helps us understand where we should focus our efforts, but it's not a crystal ball we can peer into to divine the perfect solution to any problem. In order to deliver a satisfying solution to a problem we discover, we need to consider not only our players but also the greater context in which the problem exists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key part of this is analyzing the strengths of tutorials in games in similar spaces to ours. A common theme we discovered in titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the utilization of a narrative to frame the tutorialization. Another source of inspiration that helped us solidify the idea of progressive disclosure was the completely text-based game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Heaven</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Because design is a highly iterative process, understanding what our peers do well is an important aspect of the problem-solving process.</span></p><p>Tutorials in other games. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After taking a look at some other games, it was time for some introspection. What does the current, longer tutorial do well? What does it do less well? One part of understanding this came from telemetry data, which we used to measure the impact of the tutorial on new players. Broadly speaking, we found that telemetry data indicated that finishing the tutorial wasn't a major determining factor in whether or not a player decided to keep playing. While this doesn't tell us the whole story, it does indicate that something about the tutorial was lacking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A particularly intimidating aspect of the tutorial, especially from the perspective of a new player, is its length and information density. It takes a long time to complete, and it presents the player with a lot of information, not all of which is immediately useful. All the tutorial textboxes featured in the full tutorial can be seen in the image below. In total, the full tutorial presents the player with 67 sequential boxes full of explanatory information.</span></p><p>Comparison between old (left) and new (right) tutorial steps. Image via Paradox Interactive. </p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not only does this take a long time to process and understand, but much of it is also superfluous since many of our players turn to video tutorials or other online resources to better understand the game once they've started playing. This led us to look for a way to craft an introductory experience that respects their time while still introducing them to the complex mechanics that we know our players love.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had a burgeoning understanding of the problem we were trying to solve, it was time to start exploring possible solutions. This started with a few initial whiteboard sessions with relevant stakeholders from various disciplines, allowing us to explore a variety of ideas and possible flows that a new tutorial could follow. Something that was agreed upon fairly quickly was that the new tutorial should be faster to complete than the old one.</span></p><p>Whiteboarding Session. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To figure out what the new, shorter tutorial should contain, we turned to the preexisting one. We wanted to extract all the important parts of it and compress them into something more digestible. The first step of this was to figure out what didn't feel strictly necessary to communicate to the player right away, and remove it. After doing this, we were left with roughly one-third of the 67 messages mentioned prior. These needed rewriting and reformatting to be properly implemented into the game, but they served as a baseline that we could continue to build upon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it would have been beneficial to explore other options, there simply wasn't enough time for it. Because of this, we decided to evaluate the proposed flow to get some sense of whether or not it was something that was worth moving forward with. We met with other disciplines to gather initial feedback, leading to further iteration and changes to the tutorial flow itself. Code-wise, this meant cutting the parts of the proposed tutorial that would be a lot of effort to implement without providing much in terms of actual player value, while QA and game design provided us with insights into what we should focus on communicating to the player.</span></p><p>Tutorial Flow. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The time constraints meant we had to carefully consider what kind of prototyping approach to utilize for the project. Ultimately, we settled on using the game itself as the prototyping toolbox. This approach has two primary pros, namely that it minimizes the time it takes to move from prototype to implementation, and that it closely mimics the actual gameplay experience we're trying to achieve. Fortunately, this also served as a good opportunity to iron out a few UI bugs that had been bothering us for some time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of these bugs was the fact that the GUI windows we use to display tutorial text didn't dynamically adjust its size. While this was a fairly minor bug, it made the tutorial experience feel unnecessarily cluttered and complex, even when the actual text content was short.</span></p><p>Improperly sized tutorial window. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One important aspect that we focused on was the concept of progressive disclosure—that is, as mentioned before, revealing information gradually to help players better understand the concepts we wanted to cover. One example of this is how we decided to gradually reveal information in the character panel.</span></p><p>Revealing information gradually. Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the linear part of the tutorial was done, we shifted our focus to a softer onboarding experience for newer players. We focused on creating a handful of events that serve as a form of narrative hook for the player while also gradually introducing them to game mechanics which they'll frequently have to interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These events illustrate to the player that there are several ways to play and interact with the game and encourage roleplaying by highlighting that certain options are only available because of specific traits tied to the character you're playing. Since events are a core part of the game, we felt it was important to tutorialize them in some way, which led to us adding explanatory text within the tooltips, something we don't typically do for regular events.</span></p><p>Above, a sample tutorial event. Images via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both of these sections, the linear tutorial and the events onboarding the players, were playtested internally. While we follow heuristics and guidelines when designing, these aren't a substitute for proper user testing. The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development team is a group of lovely, passionate people but we all collectively suffer from the curse of knowledge, meaning our perspective on the game isn't necessarily reflective of our playerbase. Therefore, we made sure to try the tutorial on people who primarily work on other games in the office. This led to another round of changes, which ended up becoming the final iteration of the tutorial, which you can play right now!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final words">Final words</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As this was an experiment, we're keeping the old, longer tutorial in the game as well so we can see how the two compare through telemetry. While we hope this new tutorial affects retention positively, there's a silver lining even if it doesn't. Knowing what doesn't work can be valuable, and regardless of what the data tells us, it'll help us make informed decisions in our future onboarding efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the primary takeaway we have from this experiment is that you shouldn't be afraid to try things. No result is a bad result as long as you're willing to learn from it. Playtesting is incredibly valuable for this, but we primarily use it to gather qualitative feedback, meaning it's difficult to find quantitative data we can act on without releasing something publicly. So, go out there! Break stuff! Iterate! Make stuff that's better than what came before it!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s a new PS5 system software update available now that’s bringing some big (and some long overdue) features to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console, including a new Welcome hub, party sharing and the wide launch of personalised 3D audio profiles.</p>
<p>The Welcome hub is a new customisable space that is available today for “select players” in the US, and will be rolling out over the next few weeks for the rest of the world. This brings customisable widgets and backgrounds to the PS5 home screen, so you can forefront features like battery monitoring, your personal trophy collection and more whenever you boot up the console. This should make for a much more engaging alternative to the old Explore tab – you’ll also be able to set your own background here, for a much needed personal touch.</p>



<p>Then there’s party sharing, which lets you send out chat links on other platforms and have them bring other people directly into a voice chat, both via their smartphone app and via PS5, and whether they’re in your friends list or not. It’s just another little route for establishing links between people, and will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And then we have features that were in testing with the most recent beta system update. Personalised 3D audio for headphones and earbuds is the big one here, helping you to tune the 3D spatial audio to your specific hearing. This has been something in the pipeline ever since the PS5 launched, though back then Sony considered taking photos to scan people’s ears – something that Apple and others do for Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>Here’s what it will look like:</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also adaptive controller charging on the PS5 Slim and upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which is kind of nice, and per-user Remote Play settings.</p>
<p>The update is available to download right now, though as mentioned, some of these features will be rolling out more gradually over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon confirmed that Until Dawn will include NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3. To be more specific, the upscaling components of each technology are updated to version 3.7 and 3.1, respectively. In addition, both will support NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation techniques to deliver optimal frame rates. By the way, you'll have the option to unlock the frame rate on your PC.</p>
<p>Until Dawn was always meant to be a highly cinematic game, and owners of ultrawide displays will be happy to learn that both 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios are fully supported here. The graphics have also been enhanced thanks to ray traced shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. Finally, PC users will get the full DualSense experience if they own the PS5 controller: the haptic feedback will let you feel the heartbeat of the characters during the Don’t Move sequences, while Adaptive triggers allow you to feel the weight of your choices and experience more realistic resistance when pulling the trigger of firearms.</p>
<p>Until Dawn is out on October 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has announced the&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the second game in the studio's theme park management series is landing later this fall.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/news/2024-09-12/planet-coaster-2-coming-pc-and-console-november-6th-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>website,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives across PC and consoles on November 6th, and you can pre-order both the Standard Edition and the Deluxe Edition of the game right now as well.</p>
<p>Picking up the Deluxe Edition nets you ten extra rides that Frontier says are "perfect for bestowing a classic theme and feel" upon the parks you create. All pre-orders, whether Standard or Deluxe, will also get three bonus rides as part of their pre-order.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=alPe9V98 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=HIIUwfL9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives in November to make you wish it was summer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-announced">originally unveiled in July</a>. As the name suggests, it's the second&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>game, following on from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-has-sold-1-million-copies">very popular</a> predecessor, which was released in late 2016.</p>
<p>As you might imagine,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will once again let you manage your very own theme park. You'll be able to design your own rides, set up facilities however you like, and give your guests the theme park experience of their lives.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sequel will also boast a number of new features and improvements over its predecessor. First and foremost among these is the ability to build new water rides, including flumes, swimming pools, and more.</p>
<p>Frontier is also promising "next-level customization" that utilizes brand new building and pathing tools, allowing you to build a park that looks exactly like the one in your head.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will also let you build and work on parks with friends "using a shared cross-platform save", and the Franchise Mode will let you collaborate directly with other players as well.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is angling to be the definitive theme park sim, so you'd better watch out,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/park-beyond"><em>Park Beyond</em></a>.&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 6th.</p>

What is the purpose of these ruins? Why are so many strong monsters guarding them? Will my editor forgive me for not thinking of a third question? <em>(You’re fired—Guides Ed.)</em> Read on to unravel the secrets behind at least two of those questions below.</p><h2 id="h327"><a id=""></a><strong>How to complete the Traces of the Ancients and Nemesis Takedown quests in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-recommend-id="image://cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-recommend-id="image://cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you progress through the game, you can mostly ignore the ruins you find until you accept the <strong>Traces of the Ancients</strong> quest in Illystana. This quest will task you with finding all eight ruins before you can report back to the quest giver. Note that this quest is <em>not</em> retroactive. Ruins you passed by before will need to be revisited, and you won’t be able to tell which specific ruins you have or haven’t visited. The quest will only tally how many ruins you’ve visited in total.</p><p>Fortunately, all you have to do is step foot near the ruins and watch the short cutscene play that gives you the name of the location. You don’t actually need to step inside after this point, especially if you don’t want to anger any dangerous enemies. You’ll keep uncovering new ruins after your stay in Illystana, so this isn’t a quest you can complete right away.</p><p>After you complete Traces of the Ancients, you’ll receive the <strong>Nemesis Takedown</strong> quest. This is where things get tricky. You’ll have to go back to each ruin and fight through all the groups of high-level enemies inside. For every group you defeat, a torch will light up, which will eventually unlock a secret area where a Nemesis monster lurks. These Nemeses will have a few lackeys by their side, so make sure you can deal strong single-target and AoE damage. Strategies for each Nemesis will change, but as long as you can exploit elemental weaknesses and use buffs and debuffs to bolster your defenses, you should fare well.</p><p>Defeating each nemesis will unlock one of eight powerful endgame weapons for you to use. These easily rank as some of the best equipment in the entire game, so the reward is well worth the effort. As an aside, <strong>Nemesis Takedown progress <em>is</em> retroactive</strong>. Any fights you happen to beat before accepting the quest will remain defeated and count towards your overall quest completion.</p><h2 id="h328"><a id=""></a><strong>All ruin locations and rewards in Visions of Mana</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-recommend-id="image://0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-recommend-id="image://0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to clean up either of the aforementioned quests, or you’re wondering if there’s a specific weapon you want to hunt down first, <strong>below you’ll find where you can find each ruin and the weapons they hide inside</strong>.</p><p><strong>Charred Passage</strong>: Mortal Twiliance - Spear, Val</p><p><strong>Aery Passage</strong>: Mystic Revelunge - Spear, Careena</p><p><strong>Lefeya Drifts</strong>: Mystic Ragevise - Fist, Careena</p><p><strong>Fallow Steppe</strong>: Etherial Shiftcane - Cane, Morrley</p><p><strong>Pritta Ridge</strong>: Spirit Acriscythe - Scythe, Palamena</p><p><strong>Ahrvet’s Pasture</strong>: Spirit Treadstep - Boot, Palamena</p><p><strong>Khaswia Moors</strong>: Arboreal Paraquell - Umbrella, Julei</p><p><strong>Zawhak Desert</strong>: Arborial Blossomer - Hammer, Julei</p><p>Additionally, the <strong>Traces of the Ancients</strong> quest will award you with 2,200 Lucre, 3 Parpoto Oils (heals the party for 250 HP each), and the <strong>Lucent Beam</strong> Ability Seed (a mid-level light magic spell). <strong>Nemesis Takedown</strong> will give the <strong>Respect for the Ancients</strong> Ability Seed, which increases the damage of normal attacks by 30 percent in exchange for 3 percent of your HP. “Normal attacks” refer to your basic attacks and not your heavy or special attacks, so make sure you only give this to a character who can make good use of it.</p><h2 id="h329"><a id=""></a><strong>How to defeat the ruins early in Visions of Mana</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-recommend-id="image://680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-recommend-id="image://680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obviously, these ruins are designed to be completed near the end of the game (around chapter seven or eight). However, it’s absolutely possible to complete them as low as level 30, even on Hard Mode. If you’re up for the challenge and aren’t afraid to die a few times, here’s the party composition that worked for me.</p><h3 id="h330"><a id=""></a><strong>Val</strong></h3><p><strong>Edelfrei</strong>. Having a dedicated tank doesn’t <em>seem</em> like it’d help that much at first. However, armed with the <strong>Provoke</strong> Ability Seed, enemies will tend to get confused in their AI and won’t necessarily rush at the rest of your party and pick up quick kills. I like the Dryad-driven Edelfrei class because the healing from the wood elemental vessel gives Val some natural HP regen, assuming he can tank a hit or two. You may also consider the <strong>Paladin</strong> class if you can effectively keep Val shielded, especially if you get the Mortal Twiliance first.</p><h3 id="h331"><a id=""></a><strong>Careena</strong></h3><p><strong>Divine Fist</strong>. Class strikes are ridiculously powerful in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and the Divine Fist class ignores a chunk of your enemies’ Defense stat whenever she uses one. This helps out a lot against these otherwise bulky enemies, since even a level 30 Careena with Ability Seeds that amplify class strike damage can take out a massive chunk of these level 50+ enemy health bars.</p><p>What’s more, the class strike gauge fills whenever your party takes damage, even if it’s from a killing blow. If the enemies are one-shotting your party, you’ll quickly have another class strike to use as a counter attack. Remember to bring lots of Cups of Wishes!</p><p>If you need more support, you may consider using <strong>Julei</strong> with the <strong>Hunter</strong> class as your class strike user instead. However, I have not tested the damage potential Julei has here, so your mileage may vary.</p><h3 id="h332"><a id=""></a><strong>Morley</strong></h3><p><strong>Nightblade</strong>. Just a ridiculously powerful class overall, and probably the best class to play throughout the majority of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. A 20 percent boost to Critical Hit damage and a 70 percent boost to Critical Hit rate is <em>bonkers</em>, especially since you can equip Ability Seeds to further strengthen that damage and make that Crit Rate effectively one hundred percent.</p><p>Morley attacks so fast that he can potentially stunlock enemies, and the Moon elemental vessel gives Morley yet another form of crowd control. Even if he starts out inflicting insignificant damage, the right combination of buffs and debuffs should let Morley inflict damage way above his pay grade.</p><p>From here, you don’t need to make any dramatic changes in terms of battle strategy. Each fight has similar mechanics to any other overworld fight you might encounter, albeit against high level monsters. Some enemies will resist Fire and other elements you may have been banking on, so you’ll either want to swap in different party members or save those fights for last.</p><p>Underleveled players can and will burn through their items during these fights, but Lucre is fortunately abundant enough that this shouldn’t be an issue. Otherwise, just make sure to charge your class strike gauge before each battle so you can inflict a lot of damage right out the gate. Elemental breaks also help a lot too!</p><hr><p>If you are taking these fights on at low levels, note that <strong>you’ll get a lot of experience from each group you clear</strong>. I strongly suggest using any EXP-boosting items as you complete these battles to maximize your gains. Good luck battling these baddies!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re working on something,” Hawk said. “That is the first time I’ve said that publicly. </p><p>“It will be something the fans will truly appreciate.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/27/hawk-main-1711550956739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tony Hawk.

Maybe when the dust settles, we’ll figure it out. You never know. I never would’ve thought we were going to do 1+2, 20 years later.”</p><p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater released on PSone on September 29, 1999, and went on to sell millions of copies and spawn subsequent sequels. As well as working with Activision on something new video game related, Tony Hawk is making a kids-focused animated TV show called <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-kids-focused-animated-tv-show-is-called-skatebirds">Skatebirds</a>, a title inspired by Hawk’s ‘Birdman’ nickname.</p><p><em>Photo by Sean M.

He went on to say: "I can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it."</p><p>Now, Flappy Bird is set to return, with an expanded version aiming for launch by the end of October across multiple platforms including web browsers, and an iOS and Android version planned for release in 2025. But this new Flappy Bird isn’t from Nguyen, it’s from ‘The Flappy Bird Foundation,’ which is described as “a new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Flappy Bird 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation said it has acquired the official Flappy Bird trademark from Gametech Holdings LLC, a U.S. company that appears to have wrestled the trademark from Nguyen, as well as the rights for the original game and character from Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile game that supposedly originally inspired the Flappy Bird character.</p><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation is already talking about future Flappy Bird releases, which will debut new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges.</p><p>Michael Roberts, the “chief creative” behind Flappy Bird’s return, said: “We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kek, the developer of Piou Piou, is also involved, and commented: “Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally. It’s so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It’s incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life.”</p><p>There is no mention of Dong Nguyen in The Flappy Bird Foundation’s note to press. Nguyen, who has largely avoided the limelight since pulling Flappy Bird offline, hasn't tweeted in years.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

All other images via Omdia.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStation 5 Pro will carry a launch price tag coming in just shy of $700, representing a 75% increase on both the nominal price of its last-gen predecessor PS4 Pro, and a 56% premium on the PS5 Digital Edition. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched at the same launch price as PS4.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this makes PS5 Pro’s pricing unprecedented for Sony, it is not unexpected. Historically, console manufacturers typically release cost-reduced hardware to address more price-sensitive late adopters – such as 2016’s PS4 Slim ($100 cheaper) and 2019’s Switch Lite (also $100 cheaper).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet the cost per transistor has not come down on key components such as the CPU this generation. This has had the knock-on impact of 4Q23’s PS5 Slim hardware revision releasing at either the same or a higher price than 2020’s PS5, depending on SKU and territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, hardware ASPs this generation to date have tracked above the previous generation (see Figure 1). On top of this, in 2024 Sony has de-emphasized utilizing regular discounting as a means of growing the PS5 installed base in a bid to preserve the profitability of its hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 1: ASP of PS5 hardware has remained notably higher, gen-on-gen, than PS4</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience">PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro’s $700 price point makes it an aspirational device aimed at players who desire the very best experience. Platform holders have historically catered to this small but highly engaged audience in the past with niche systems that lay adjacent to popular home console platforms, such as 1991’s Neo Geo AES ($649 or $1502 in real terms) and 1993’s 3DO ($699, or $1512 in real terms).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The difference today is that the premium “Pro” consoles are mid-gen refreshes – they are additive to what are existing, thriving console platforms. In the case of PS5 Pro, it will still sit alongside an active installed base of PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 players – of which their software and services boast significant interoperability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 2: Pro consoles accounted for just 13% of combined PS4 and Xbox One installed base by end of 2019</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also not the first of its breed – Sony has already had a run of history with PS4 Pro. Omdia data reveals that just 1.8 million PS4 Pro systems were sold in its launch year, 2016. By the end of its fourth calendar year on the market, 2019, the 13.9m units of PS4 Pro sold accounted for under 15% of the overall PS4 installed base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, Omdia’s historical console hardware data reveals that the equivalent Microsoft system, Xbox One X, also only accounted for just over 10% of installed consoles following the same timeframe. Combined, both “Pro” machines only accounted for just over 13% of the installed base of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles (see Figure 2).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite PS4 Pro’s comparatively competitive pricing, then, it was always an enthusiast device – a stark contrast to previous mid-generation upgrades such as Game Boy Color, DSi, and New Nintendo 3DS. And Sony has usage data on PS4 and PS5 players that will have pinpointed a large enough highly engaged portion of its audience that would make PS5 Pro a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 3: Total addressable market across PlayStation consoles largely static gen-on-gen</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Addressable Market Metrics Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s this engagement that is key to understanding Sony’s strategy with PS5 Pro. With the active installed base of PlayStation users remaining static as it transitions between generations (see Figure 3), Sony has focused its attention on increasing lifetime spend per console. This has materialized in the following ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is another means for Sony to either target the highly engaged – or allow the highly engaged to self-select themselves into the PlayStation ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet despite the above, Omdia does not anticipate PS5 Pro to sell in the same volumes as its predecessor. PS4 Pro not only launched at a comparatively lower price point, but coincided with both the adoption of 4K TVs hitting a critical mass. It also launched simultaneously alongside PlayStation VR, a more compelling platform than current-generation successor PS VR 2.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024">PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As PS5 approaches its fifth full year on the market without a single permanent price drop, the absence of key first-party blockbuster games throughout 2024 coupled with a prolonged cross-generation period has led to PS5 entering its decline phase a year earlier than PS4 did in its cycle.</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s preliminary console forecast estimates that even in a best-case scenario, sales volumes for PlayStation 5 would still decline by 17% in 2024, when compared with 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, PlayStation 5 Pro is set to launch alongside the casual-friendly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lego Horizon Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is currently the only confirmed major first-party title slated for the holiday season. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched in close proximity to fan favorite first-party triple-A games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted 4, The Last Guardian, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gravity Rush 2.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is also arriving in a development landscape where the gestation period for triple-A games is longer and more costly than it was in the previous generation. This has materialized as a sustained cross-generation period in the PS5’s cycle, where publishers have only recently begun leaving behind the last-generation systems for their triple-A games. Yet at the same time, 2024 has also been a quiet year for such major releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony does, however, have an opportunity to ride off the halo effects created by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto 6, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which is expected for release in 2025</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The game is expected to launch exclusively on console platforms, with a PC release coming at least a year later. This would leave PlayStation 5 Pro as the premier place to experience what is one of the most hotly anticipated games in the modern age. If Sony is smart, it should strike a marketing deal with publisher Take-Two to promote the game alongside its new console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro will prove an interesting case study for the console market due to its notable contrast against its predecessor PS4 Pro. That older system was a defense strategy against the moving baseline of PC gaming hardware and an answer to the adoption of 4K TVs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, PS5 Pro is razor-focused on an audience which wouldn’t think twice about moving to PC. But at its $700 price point, the stakes will be high for PS5 Pro to deliver a tangible benefit to this audience in the three-four years before Sony begins its transition to PS6, especially in a generation that has delivered fewer exclusive blockbuster games than the last.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead has revealed its next Premium Warbond, known as Chemical Agents.</p>
<p>Chemical Agents comes complete with some "seriously deadly toys", including stratagems, utilities, emotes and more.</p>
<p>On the Warbond's release, players will be able to get their hands on the likes of the TX-41 Sterilizer, the G-4 Gas grenade (which will "cover the whole area in a cloud of noxious fumes") and the new utility P-11 Stim Pistol. You can check out the gas-filled trailer for Chemical Agents below.</p>

<p>If you want to update your overall look, there will also be new armor and capes to adorn your Helldiver with. These include the Standard of Safe Distance cape and the Patient Zero's Remembrance cape. It may be true that not all heroes wear capes, but these ones do!</p>
<p>Emote wise, you are looking at the Natural Gas Extraction emote, which will allow your squad to pull your finger. For those moments of victory, meanwhile, there is an emote simply known as Ew.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2's Chemical Agents Premium Warbond is set to release later this month, on 19th September. Further details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-launches-sept-19/">PlayStation Blog</a>. </p>

            <p>Unity has cancelled the controversial Runtime Fee for use of its game engine tools, which charged developers for each game install, with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">pricing plan was introduced in September</a> last year and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a>, calling it an "astonishing scumbag move" among other responses.</p>
<p>Today, in a <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">blog post</a> from new president and CEO of Unity Matt Bromberg, the company announced it will revert back to a traditional subscription model "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>

<p>Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone.</p>
<p>"However, we can’t pursue that mission in conflict with our customers; at its heart, it must be a partnership built on trust," said Bromberg. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form."</p>
<p>Now, Unity Personal will remain free and the current revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled to $200,000 USD, meaning more developers can use Unity at no cost.</p>
<p>For its Pro and Enterprise packages, Unity will revert to a traditional subscription, with pricing and qualifying annual revenue thresholds increasing from 1st January 2025.</p>
<p>"Cancelling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," concluded Bromberg.</p>
<p>After announcing the introduction of the Runtime Fee, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reportedly-considering-cap-on-hugely-controversial-per-install-fees">Unity considered adding a cap</a> to the fees and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-announces-significant-changes-to-its-controversial-new-pricing-plan">announced significant changes</a> along with an apology.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-from-company-weeks-after-pricing-controversy">CEO John Riccitiello left the company</a> following the pricing controversy.

<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official Unity website, company CEO Matt Bromberg says the decision to cancel the runtime fee was made "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>
<p>Bromberg goes on to say that his company's mission to "democratiz[e] game development" can't be achieved if the company is "in conflict with our customers", and that price increases, while necessary, "needn't come in a novel and controversial new form".</p>

Additionally, the Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games made using Unity 6, which <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/introducing-unity-6-the-next-major-release-of-unity/933629" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launches later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Things are a little different for the Pro and Enterprise models, however. Pro subscriptions will jump by 8% to $2,200 per year, effective from January 1st, and if your game has more than $200,000 in revenue and funding, you'll need to use this tier.</p>
<p>The Enterprise tier, meanwhile, is for customers with more than $25 million total revenue and funding. The price of this tier will jump by 25%, but Blomberg says he and his company will contact customers on this tier in the next few days "to discuss customized packages".</p>
<p>Unity says it'll return to this pricing structure every year to decide whether it needs to be increased or not, but that if the Editor changes "in ways that impact you", you can keep using the previous version "as long as you keep using that version".</p>

Those changes didn't scrap the runtime fee, but they did make it a little less punitive for smaller developers.</p>
<p>The controversy saw then-CEO John Riccitello <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy">stepping down from the company</a>, and Unity subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">laid off a huge number of workers</a> in January this year. That move may or may not be related to the runtime fee controversy, but said controversy certainly can't have helped.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes restore trust in Unity among the developer community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eu-organization-says-premium-currency-is-purposefully-tricking-gamers.979218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eu-organization-premium-currency-complaint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An EU consumer watchdog organization has submitted a complaint to EU authorities regarding the use of premium currency in games, which the organization says "maximizes consumers' spending" and constitutes "manipulative spending tactics".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the complaint</a>, BEUC (Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, otherwise known as the European Consumer Organization) says games like&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>engage in "unfair practices" via their premium currency systems.</p>
<p>The group's director general,&nbsp;Agustín Reyna, says the group has "identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money", and that "deceptive practices must be stopped". BEUC is calling on the EU to "ensure that traders play by the rules" and provide safe environments for gamers and children.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=EZolaEL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=_440aACX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>is one of the games BEUC says is engaging in unfair practices with regards to spending.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC says it's identified four main problem areas with regards to premium currency in gaming.</p>
<p>The first is that consumers "cannot see the real cost of digital items" when premium currency is sold in bundles or the price of the currency is not transparent. The group therefore recommends all in-game purchases be displayed in real-money terms.</p>
<p>According to the group, companies that claim players prefer in-game currency "are wrong"; BEUC says its data shows consumers "find this unnecessary step misleading" and would prefer simply to use real money for their purchases.</p>
<p>Third, BEUC says consumers "are often denied their rights" when making premium currency purchases, and that publishers often tie these purchases to "unfair terms favoring game developers".</p>
<p>Finally, the group says children are "even more vulnerable" to the unfair practices it's complaining about. It points to data showing that children in Europe make around&nbsp;€39 worth of purchases per month in games (that's about $43).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=n6j5dFz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=PFHBEn7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but you're in BEUC's crosshairs as well.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC's full report makes a number of recommendations to combat this problem, including assessing a potential ban on premium currency sale for in-game and in-app purchases, as well as "stricter transparency requirements" in EU consumer law and "stronger consumer protection and regulation".</p>
<p>If this seems like a waltz we've danced before, that's because it is, specifically with regards to predatory practices implemented with systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/uk-asa-loot-boxes-ea-jagex-miniclip">loot boxes</a>, microtransactions, and battle passes.</p>
<p>In-game monetization, especially in single-player games, is becoming a dirty term among players, leading to games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">pledging not to include any</a>&nbsp;(although that doesn't stop games like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement">locking features behind microtransactions</a>, bizarrely).</p>
<p>If you'd like to, you can read BEUC's <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report here</a>. Of course, it's not legally binding right now; it remains to be seen whether EU authorities will make changes based on this report or not, but its conclusions are pretty compelling.

<p>It’s been more than one year since the launch of Starfield, and we’re finally getting the game’s first story expansion pack. It’s a big one, delving into the mysteries of Va’ruun, with countless new locations and mechanics to explore. For those excited about the prospect of more space exploration, here is everything we know about Starfield Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-shattered-space-release-date">What is the Shattered Space Release Date?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to wait long to play the first Starfield expansion; Shattered Space launches on <strong>September 30</strong>. As far as we know, there is no advanced access for buying the expansion early, so everyone who purchases the DLC will receive it on the same day.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-shattered-space-cost">How Much Does Shattered Space Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you purchase Shattered Space separately, it costs <strong>$29.99</strong>. However, buying the Starfield Digital Premium Edition for $99.99 includes the expansion and a few other in-game goodies, including the soundtrack and cosmetic weapon skins. If you previously bought the Premium Edition, you <strong>do not need to buy</strong> Shattered Space again! It will be automatically added to your library on release!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-shattered-space">How Big is Shattered Space?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda hopes to reignite the fan base with its first Starfield expansion by offering an expansive story to explore. Shattered Space includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 50 all-new locations across Va’ruun’kai</li>



<li>Brand-new grenades, which you can now craft</li>



<li>Additional enemies and creatures, such as Redeemed and Vortex Horrors</li>



<li>The return of the Zealots, Spacers, and Crimson Fleet</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, it’s unclear precisely when the expansion will take place in the game. It appears that Va’ruun’kai is an end-game planet meant for high-level characters with considerable time in the game. If that’s the case, it will prevent many new players from accessing the content straight away. Surely, however, Bethesda thought of that.</p>



<p>In any case, Shattered Space is a story-based expansion, though as you can see from the 50 new locations promised, it’ll offer considerable exploration opportunities, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-will-shattered-space-be">How Long Will Shattered Space Be?</h2>



<p>There are no official confirmations from Bethesda regarding the length of Shattered Space. However, some estimates place it between 7 to 10 hours to complete. You can stretch out your time in the new content by exploring all 50 unique locations, the entire planet of Va’ruun’kai, and interacting with every new character. But if you solely want to focus on the story content, I would estimate around 8 hours. I could be wrong, and I’ll happily eat my words and update this piece once we know more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-shattered-space-available-on">What Platforms is Shattered Space Available On?</h2>



<p>Like the base game, Shattered Space will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S. There’s still no word on whether Starfield is coming to PS5, and it’s doubtful they will backport the game to Xbox One or PS4.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-shattered-space-the-last-expansion-for-starfield">Is Shattered Space the Last Expansion for Starfield?</h2>



<p>No! At least, we certainly hope not. Previously, Todd Howard said they intend to release annual story-based expansion packs for Starfield well into the future to extend the game’s lifespan. They didn’t want to leave everyone hanging for a decade, like with Skyrim, while awaiting their next major release.</p>

                <p>Ahead of its launch next month, Sony has revealed a few more details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/until-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-616356">Until Dawn</a> remake's PC release, including its system requirements and recommended specs. Similar to the PC ports of other PlayStation Studios games, Until Dawn will benefit from advanced graphical features, customizability, and accessibility features. Developer Supermassive Games has designed the remake to run on a variety of PC configurations, with presets ranging from a 720p 30fps mode that uses low graphical settings, up to a 4K 60fps mode.</p><p>For the least-demanding presets, you'll be able to experience the interactive horror game with an Nvidia GeForce 1660 or a Radeon RX 470 graphics card. If you're aiming for a consistent 1080p 60fps experience, you'll need to have a GeForce RTX 2060 or Radeon RX 6600XT GPU installed and at least 16GB of RAM. For anyone looking for a stable 4K 60fps mode using very high presets, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/until-dawn-pc-features-and-specs-revealed-out-october-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supermassive recommends</a> a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or a Radeon RX 6900XT GPU.</p><h2>Until Dawn PC Minimum and Recommended Specs</h2><hr><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Preset</strong></td><td><strong>Low</strong></td><td><strong>Medium</strong></td><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Very high</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Average performance</strong></td><td>720p 30fps</td><td>1080p 60fps</td><td>1440p 60fps / 4K 30fps</td><td>4K 60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i7 4790K / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (or similar processor with AVX support)</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i7 11700K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 / Radeon RX 470 (or equivalent card with minimum 6GB VRAM)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p>The common thread between all the available graphical options is that you'll need an SSD with 70GB of storage capacity available--and an NVMe one specifically for the higher graphical presets--a fairly large amount of space but thankfully <em>much </em>less demanding than the chunk of storage that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-specs-revealed-along-with-hefty-storage-requirement/1100-6525645/" data-ref-id="1100-6525645">God of War Ragnarok will require</a>. If you've got the hardware to support the game, Supermassive says you can expect ultrawide monitor support, cinematic aspect ratios, a curated set of ray-tracing features, and both upscaling and frame-generation support through Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.1.</p><p>Full DualSense controller support on PC will also be available, and Supermassive says you'll be able to feel the heartbeat of the characters during intense sequences alongside several other haptic feedback features.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-is-out-october-4-puts-it-on-collision-course-with-silent-hill-2/1100-6525780/" data-ref-id="1100-6525780">Out on October 4</a> for PS5 and PC, Until Dawn is a remake of the 2015 game and features a substantial number of changes to make the game feel more cinematic in nature. Remade entirely in Unreal Engine 5, the game features updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations. Supermassive has also upgraded its gore effects, as the game features "realistic real-time fluids" and more convincing injuries for its cast.</p><p>This is just one of several horror games launching in October, and fans of the genre can also play the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-let-you-turn-off-ui-apply-old-school-90s-filter/1100-6526267/" data-ref-id="1100-6526267">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-quiet-place-game-finally-revealed-and-it-looks-terrifying/1100-6524309/" data-ref-id="1100-6524309">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadows-of-the-damned-is-getting-remaster-12-years-after-it-was-released/1100-6514997/" data-ref-id="1100-6514997">Shadows of the Damned remaster</a>.</p>

The feature will be gradually released to other regions outside of the US, starting with Japan and select countries in Europe, then the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Players can also change the background of their Welcome hub, and can pick from a variety of preset backgrounds or choose a screenshot from the Media Gallery. Within the next few weeks, the PS5 will let players share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app. This feature lets players invite their friends to join a party voice chat, even if they're not listed in your friend list of PlayStation Network. By opening the link on their mobile device, the friends can join the party on their PS5 or from PlayStation App.</p><p>Back in July, Sony was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-beta-update-adds-adaptive-charging-remote-play-settings-and-more-3d-audio-options/1100-6525257/" data-ref-id="1100-6525257">testing some other features</a>, such as a personalized 3D audio profiles, individual remote play options, and adaptive controller charging. Now, those features are rolling out globally today. It's also important to note that the adaptive controller charging feature is only available for PS5 Slim and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">newly announced PS5 Pro.</a></p>

The change isn't happening in a vacuum. Unity is also raising prices on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscriptions, and according to CEO Matthew Bromberg, it's part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a bold statement for the chief executive of a publicly-traded firm to make. But given what the organization has been through, it may be warranted. Unity has spent the last two years </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-cutting-1-800-jobs-in-the-name-of-profitable-growth-">laying off employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-pro-and-enterprise-plans-are-going-up-in-price">raising prices</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and implementing policies like the Runtime Fee, all to the chagrin of developers, some of whom have claimed it's fallen behind on maintaining the quality of the engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Bromberg pitched a vision of the company that doesn't rely on moves like those to boost profitability, saying that Unity's goal going forward is to "have its head on straight," and be a better partner to help developers make great games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity is once again, promising to be better at listening">Unity is once again, promising to be better at listening</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last two years of speedbumps for Unity (which included that time former CEO John Riccitiello said some developers are '</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-sorry-for-calling-devs-fucking-idiots-regrets-using-crude-language">fucking idiots</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">') were often followed by company executives telling customers the company wasn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-exec-admits-company-wasn-t-listening-enough-to-devs-over-runtime-fee">listening</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enough to game developers. Bromberg deployed a version of that line in that conversation, saying the company needs to "be better at listening" in the future.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-killing-its-controversial-runtime-fee" target="_self">Exclusive: Unity is killing its controversial Runtime Fee</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Runtime Fee reversal is an outcome of that process, he said. He apparently spent his first 100 days at the company speaking with Unity customers, which include the popular Unity game engine and its affiliated marketing and monetization platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed about feedback from employees, many of whom reportedly raised concerns internally about the impact of the Runtime Fee and how it could hurt Unity users, Bromberg said the same listening process has been taking place inside the company. He said this decision followed a cross-functional group of employees weighing in on where the company should go.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also acknowledged ongoing concerns about Unity's stability and tech debt, a growing concern among developers frustrated by Unity's rising prices while still experiencing quality-of-life issues with the engine. He said a key goal for Unity is to make a "stable, well-performing" product that will make the company a better "partner" for developers who use it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some, like Godot cofounder Juan Linietsky, have pointed out to Game Developer that Unity's IPO-driven acquisition spree saddled the company with new tools it would be responsible for maintaining for high-value customers. Bromberg said Unity has also been looking at that challenge, and referred to its decision to to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-eliminating-265-jobs-and-terminating-weta-fx-partnership">end its partnership with Weta FX</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as one example of how it can ease the technical load it had taken on (here, with the cost of 265 jobs).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There is progress we can make on integrating some of the capabilities those acquisitions provided into our core flow of game building," Bromberg said. For now, there will be a renewed focus on improving and maintaining Unity 6 as a reliable game development tool.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity's shift is also about &quot;getting back to where it began&quot;">Unity's shift is also about "getting back to where it began"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's description of Unity's future seemed far afield from Riccitiello's promise of making the best "Real-time 3D" (often shortened to RT3D) engine for companies across the world, which implied a future where Unity would be extensively used outside the world of game development. He repeatedly referred to his past experience as a game developer, and painted a picture of the company working closely with developers to give them the tools they needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity will be doing so with stronger competition. Tools like open-source game engine Godot have become more popular with developers in the last year, with Godot in particular </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.godotes.com/issue-51-almost-there/">biting at Unity's heels</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a leading engine used in game jams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear what, if anything, Unity will be directly adapting from developers' increased enthusiasm for Godot. Bromberg did say he doesn't take developers' trust for granted, and that the company "wants to get better" to retain that trust.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want everyone to want to use Unity," he said, also acknowledging that the company is in a competitive market and it will need to labor under pressure from competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Addressing concerns investors may have about the company not having revenue from Runtime Fee-generated revenue in the future, Bromberg said the "simple, predictable pricing" the company has laid out will provide "more than enough growth" for the company with its pricing model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity's previous far-reaching promises of game engine growth previously extended all the way to the US government, with the company signing some contracts with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-signs-multi-million-dollar-contract-to-help-u-s-government-with-defense">technology firms</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and companies like Lockheed Martin, BAH to provide support for the United States defense projects. Developers concerned their use of the engine could in some way support weapons manufacturing or wartime software development have maintained criticism of Unity for making these agreements, largely to little avail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg held firm on said contracts. "My view in general is that it is not inappropriate for American companies to have business with the American government," he said. Developers might raise their eyebrows at how that comment goes further than the Department of Defense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The U.S. government aside, Bromberg's pitch seemed squarely aimed at Unity's original customers: the game development community. He and his peers will have a chance to make that pitch next week at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/events/unite">Unite 2024 in Barcelona</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he said he sees a chance to "take a breath, clear the decks, and reconnect" with customers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After two years of conversations with Unity executives, there was another interesting shift in Bromberg's rhetoric worth noting. Previously, Unity execs Marc Whitten and Jim Rearden referred to Unity users as "creators," alluding to a wide range of customers that went beyond game developers. The phrase seemed to align with Riccitiello's established vision of Unity as an "RT3D" tool versus its role as a game development tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg didn't use that phrase, going instead back to "developers" and "customers," more generic terms describing those who use Unity. It also doesn't appear in Unity's blog announcing the Runtime Fee reversal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The absence of the term may mean nothing, but it may be one sign Unity is re-narrowing its vision to first and foremost, serve a business focused on making games, not generalized 3D software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers report a better relationship with Unity in the months and years ahead, it will certainly be a sign that Bromberg's strategy is working. The challenge will be—as it long has been—to ensure that strategy us profitable and sustainable for the company, so that sustainability can be a strong foundation for the game development community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Update: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">This story has been updated to clarify Unity's contractual relationships with the United States Government.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
