			<p>Some of the issues found in the PC version of DOOM: The Dark Ages will require a driver fix, and thus won't be fixed with any patch that may launch once the game releases to the public later this week.</p>
<p>Following the game's early access release for all who pre-ordered it, developer id Software shared a new FAQ, including a list of known issues on all platforms. The list of PC issues is rather substantial, and includes issues like crashing issues when playing on an RTX 50 series GPU with G-Sync or V-Sync enabled and Multi Frame Generation, game locking issues when resizing the window manually while using AMD FSR frame generation, game launching in the background if alt-tabbing on an NVIDIA GPU, OBS capturing issues and others. Some of these issues, as mentioned above, require some driver fixes and may take some more time to get fixed.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of DOOM: The Dark Ages known PC issues and their fixes or workarounds below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 50 series GPU and enable G-Sync (supported display required) or V-Sync plus Multi Frame Generation through NVIDIA Control Panel you can crash the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until a driver fix is available, the workaround for this issue is to either disable one of these options in the NVIDIA control panel or if you want both enabled, set them in-game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 40 or 50 series GPU and enable Multi Frame Generation or FrameGen, V-Sync still shows as enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a minor cosmetic issue – the game disables V-Sync under the hood in these cases.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA GPUs may find that Alt-Tabbing while launching the game can cause the game to launch in the background and not be accessible.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a known driver issue. Until a fix is available in a driver update, to avert this issue, avoid Alt-Tabbing during game launch. If encountered, it can be resolved by restarting your PC.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA 50 series GPUs may experience TDRs or system hangs when starting gameplay recording using Shadowplay with MultiFrameGen set to 3x or 4x.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, either do not use the noted MFG settings or record gameplay with a different application.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If capturing with OBS, game visuals may freeze when Alt-tabbing from Fullscreen</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until there is an update from OBS, the workaround for the issue is to capture in Windowed or Borderless mode.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: The game can lock up when manually resizing the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not manually resize the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users who unplug a 2nd monitor during gameplay may notice that the game has frozen.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not unplug any monitors while playing the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Players running the game with the MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner overlays enabled may experience stability issues.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not run the game with either application running in the background.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: In rare cases, players running DOOM: The Dark Ages on a supported PC spec at appropriate settings, who have the latest GPU drivers installed and also have an intel CPU model number that starts with the number 13 or 14 can run into persistent crashing.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: In such cases, you may have a corrupted CPU. Please contact intel Customer Support at&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fcontact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages also has some known issues on consoles as well. Some of these issues are already being investigated and will potentially be fixed in future updates. You can find the full list <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/509579946274851061">here</a>.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S for all those who pre-ordered the game. It will become available for everyone else on May 15th.

Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Attention, Helldivers: This is a Galactic Emergency.</p><p>The true Illuminate invasion has begun. In a sudden and completely unprovoked offensive manoeuvre, the full Illuminate fleet is emerging from the Meridia Singularity. Nothing is safe - not even the Heart of Democracy itself. <a href="https://t.co/2hgtK6akMb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2hgtK6akMb</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1922215852037783771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/54507366342-1ca82333da-h-1747129689963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class.</blockquote><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/hd2-1747129737498.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead has also unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on the Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. This backlog of patterns unlock on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/086ad5db38d420a0982fd909484ab56747c929ac-1747130320086.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Superstore has been changed so items you want are always available, as opposed to players having to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside new features, patch 01.003.000 brings with it an extensive balance pass, with changes to spread, drag, sway, melee weapons stamina cost, shrapnel spawning, and fire damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>As one of the developers who worked on the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> back in the early 2000s, Chance Glasco wonders if the behemoth FPS franchise has run out of ideas. A series veteran and one of the original members of Infinity Ward, Glasco says he doesn't play much CoD anymore--though he does enjoy a bit of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p>In an interview with Tulsa, Oklahoma's <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/6821e0dcae532fd615116ad5/call-of-duty-creator-chance-glasco-tulsa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">News 9</a>, Glasco shares his experience as one of the 23 employees who left Medal of Honor developer 2015, Inc. for newly established Infinity Ward to work on Call of Duty. "We knew we could make a really good game," Glasco said. "Activision gave us the freedom to do things we couldn’t on Medal of Honor, but it was still a new franchise."</p><p>Call of Duty wasn't an instant hit when it released in 2003. Instead, it took time for word to spread. "It didn't have a big spike in sales right away," Glasco recalls. "It just climbed gradually as word got out. Multiplayer really hooked people, and over time, it became huge."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="75620148" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"It's almost like The Simpsons--it's been around so long that it feels like they've run out of ideas at times. It kind of wandered into left field, but I still enjoy playing Warzone."</p><p>"I spent more time making WWII games than America was actually in WWII, so moving to modern settings felt refreshing," Glasco added, referring to the shift in setting that started with Modern Warfare in 2007. "I wouldn’t say [Call of Duty] peaked at Modern Warfare 2, but that was probably the best game we made."</p><p>Call of Duty gets a new main-title release every year, and has followed that release pattern since 2005. The series now also has multiple ongoing live-service games including free-to-play battle royale title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-572199">Warzone's mobile port</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call Of Duty: Mobile</a>. The most recent major CoD release was Black Ops 6, in October last year.</p>

            <p>
Fancy testing FBC: Firebreak this weekend? Control developer Remedy has now opened a sign-up process for its upcoming Control multiplayer spin-off to let you do just that.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak's first closed technical test will run from this Thursday, 15th May at 2pm UK time to next Monday, 19th May at 10pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy will be testing a pre-release version of the game across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S during this period, and you can register your interest now via the <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">developer's website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Set within Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, and revisiting a number of familiar locations from that game, FBC: Firebreak is a three-player PVE shooter spin-off from Remedy set to launch on 17th June.
</p>
<p>
The past year has seen mixed results for other new shooters, with the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> but also the failure of Concord. During a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">recent Q&amp;A session attended by Eurogamer</a>, Remedy said it was confident its new offering would find a niche. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy's Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."
</p>
<p>
When FBC: Firebreak does arrive, it'll be sold for the comparatively cheap price of £33/$40/€40 and also be available via both Xbox Game Pass (including PC Game Pass) and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Planning to give it a try?

            <p>
Nintendo has revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> firmware option that caps its battery charging at around 90 percent. 
</p>
<p>
The option is designed to ensure the device's battery lasts longer over time, at the expense of obviously leaving the device with slightly less juice.
</p>
<p>
The option can be found in the Switch 2's settings menu, under its System settings option. Here you can toggle on the "Stop Charging Around 90 Percent" option.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Nintendo detailed the feature today via its smartphone Nintendo Today app, and included a video (posted by others on social media, and embedded above) showing the option in action. 
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2's settings menu offers more detail on how the option works, stating that the feature "shortens the amount of time the system can be used while unplugged but can help reduce loss of battery capacity over time. 
</p>
<p>
"Even if turned on," Nintendo continues, "the system may charge to 100 percent to ensure accurate battery-level display".
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 isn't the first device to have this feature, but it is the first time a Nintendo console or handheld has provided such an option. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles during the current financial year, once the hotly-anticipated console arrives on 5th June. Speaking to investors last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo said this total would see Switch 2 selling at a faster rate than Switch 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">had not been constrained by production issues or the threat of higher prices from tariffs</a>.

			<p>The successful release of Monster Hunter Wilds and the strong sales of other titles, including previous entries in the series, have driven another record year for CAPCOM.</p>
<p>In new <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/result/2024/full/4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents</a> shared today presenting the financial results of the fiscal year ending March 31st, the Japanese publisher reported 169,604 million net sales and 65,777 million yen operating income, an increase of 11.3% and 15.2% respectively, over the previous fiscal year. The Digital Contents Business, the publisher's video game business, recorded 51.87 million units sold, over 5 million units more than the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The excellent results of CAPCOM's Digital Content Business were mostly driven by Monster Hunter Wilds, which managed to ship 10 million units in just one month of availability. Other games by the publisher have contributed to the strong sales in the fiscal year, including solid sales of past entries in the series, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which have brought the total units shipped worldwide to over 100 million units.</p>
<p>Though no major release in the vein of Monster Hunter Wilds has been announced to date, CAPCOM is expecting FY2026 to be another record year with net sales expected to exceed 190,000 million yen and operating income 73,000 million yen, a 12% and 11% increase over the previous fiscal year. As this year's lineup at the time of writing only consists of remasters and ports, with only <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-will-last-20-hours-and-wont-be-open-world-says-capcom/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> being the only new game scheduled for 2026, there's a very good chance there will be some surprises launching before March 31st, 2026.</p>
<p>Though low difficulty and performance issues impact the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds' success is completely deserved, thanks to its open-world approach that makes the typical gameplay loop even more engaging.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/if-letters-had-pants">If Letters Had Pants</a> appears to be the product of three different elevator pitches that took place in the same elevator, and somehow resolved amicably rather than eating each other alive.</p>
<p>The first pitch was for a verbal puzzler in which you combine letters into words on a randomised grid against the clock, with the twist that words vanish when scored to create blank spaces that can be bridged by other letter combinations for higher scores. The second pitch was for a bizarrely prudish roguelite that is all about ensuring that letters are properly dressed. And the third pitch was for an archaeological excavation sim in which you exhibit things like lost floppy discs, or sell them to expand your museum. The result, against the odds, is a single and cohesive video game rather than a claustrophobic clownfight. Witness the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Here’s how the moving parts join together. The word puzzle grid is also a patch of dirt, beneath which lurk the aforesaid archaeological relics. When you combine and remove letters, you’re also lifting away the soil to expose these priceless finds. </p>
<p>Putting pants on letters, meanwhile, gives them modifiers, for use in both the archaelogical excavation and grid puzzler sides of the game. For example, you can whack some gardening trousers on the letter “W” to plant a turnip when it's removed, which grows as you combine words and can eventually be harvested for bonus score. Similarly, you’ll unlock new modifiers as you expand your museum collection.</p>
<p>Ah, wait a minute. This is sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> again, isn’t it? A roguish perma-progressioner with a touch of deckbuilding. Still, the mix of influences is quite distinctive. I like the idea that I might have to choose between a high-scoring word and a low-scoring word that’ll earn me another relic.</p>

                <p>The next WoW Remix event is coming, and this time it's fan-favorite expansion Legion in the spotlight. The upcoming Legion Remix event had already been teased by Blizzard, but it was officially announced at the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2454299911?t=7h16m54s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolving Azeroth panel</a> at PAX East over the weekend.</p><p>World of Warcraft associate game director Jeremy Feasel officially announced the new Remix event, as picked up by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/legion-remix-officially-announced-at-pax-east-mythic-and-shattered-timeline-376808?utm_source=discord-webhook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, and shared some insight into the ongoing process of remixing Legion.</p><p>"Legion has a lot of content--way more content than Mists of Pandaria--and it has a huge amount of different systems," he reminded fans. "The team is currently hard at work delving deep into 'how we are going to integrate all these systems in a remixed way. Which systems are we gonna remix? Which systems are we gonna remix and add new things to?'"</p><p>The extra complexity in Legion means we don't have many details or even a release date for Legion Remix yet, but Feasel did share a few tidbits on what fans can expect. First in line to get the Remix treatment are Mythic Keystones, which were first introduced to WoW in the Legion expansion.</p><p>"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could do Mythic Keystones with the wild item scaling of Remix, and see how high you can go? We think that would be cool. We're really excited about folks getting a chance to do that and just figuring out how to completely break that game," Feasel said, adding that he fully expects players to break the game with the remixed Mythics--and have a lot of fun doing it.</p><p>The second feature of Legion Remix that Feasel announced on the panel was the addition of a new increased-difficulty world tier called the Shattered Timeline. "It's a timeline where everything went worse, and everybody is significantly more difficult," Feasel explained, adding that the addition of world tiers was heavily inspired by the Diablo team.</p><p>WoW's first Remix event was Mists of Pandaria, which dropped around this time last year. The event, which saw players power-levelling through Pandaria and picking up powerful new gear and items, was a hit with fans, leaving players speculating what other expansions would be up for the Remix treatment next.</p>

            <p>
It's been an intriguing 24 hours in the Oblivion Remastered community, after the sighting of a mysterious ghost horse captured fans' imagination and began making headlines. But now, after some scrutiny and deduction, Oblivion players reckon they've figured out what's going on.
</p>
<p>
The story began over the weekend when - wiggly line flashback - user TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">shared an eye-catching discovery on the Oblivion subreddit</a>, curious to know if it was new to the remaster or just something they'd missed before. "So I was crafting stupid spells in Frostcrag Spire [when] I noticed something suuuuuuper strange in the distance," they wrote. "I did as any of us of the right mind would do and B-lined it over there like a maniac. To my amazement [it] was this spectral horse with no name. I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion... yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse."
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">Uhhhh, guys, is this new?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TaricIsNotASupport/">u/TaricIsNotASupport</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
All this came with the assurance they were Oblivioning on PlayStation - and thus, it wasn't the result of a mod - and a video showing the aforementioned ghost horse swishing nonchalantly (and translucently) by the side of a cliff. With the community's interest piqued, TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk7rmg/to_the_people_asking_if_i_can_ride_or_interact/">returned with a second post</a>, this time showing their character riding the phantom equine atop snow-covered mountains. "He fast travels and even gets stabled!", they enthusiastically added. "By all accounts it's now my steed!"
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, TaricIsNotSupport's post was greeted with a mixture of skepticism - given the original Oblivion has been pretty well stripped of secrets in the 19 years since its release - and enthusiasm for a new mystery to solve. After all, the possibility developer Virtuos might have squeaked a couple of Easter eggs into its remaster couldn't entirely be dismissed. Some set to work poring over previously accumulated Oblivion knowledge, while others posited - given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>' notoriously buggy releases - it was possibly a spell-based glitch.
</p>
<p>
Alas, it now appears the latter is true. After some experimentation, subredditor Famous-Escape-2491 shared the news they'd <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">managed to replicate the spectral horse effect</a> using a combination of spells. "Looks like it is due to the glitches where spell visual effects are lingering past their expiration," they wrote. "I was able to recreate the visual using 100 percent chameleon, and Command Creature." They also provided a video as proof.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">Spectral Horse Debunk</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Famous-Escape-2491/">u/Famous-Escape-2491</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
Famous-Escape-2491 also cautioned against a witch-hunt, noting that rather than being a deliberate wind-up, there was every chance the original poster could "genuinely be unaware" how the spectral steed came to be. "Looking at his posts before that one," they added, "it looks like he plays around with spells - a lot. And considering the weird glitches I've seen, I can't rule out with 100 percent certainty that he may be truthful... I don't want to add to any negativity towards the guy, especially not knowing the specifics of how his scenario occurred."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; Oblivion Remastered's horse ghost is seemingly toast, debunked by community ingenuity and a scientific thirst for answers. If you're feeling a little deflated all this excitement was for nought, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">currently canvassing fans to suggest improvements</a> to its hugely-popular game. So maybe it'll add a real ghost horse if we ask nicely? And if it's <em>more</em> answers you want, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-tips-tricks-and-guides">check out Eurogamer's Oblivion Remastered guide</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I've asked Bethesda for comment on Oblivion Remastered's ghost horse mystery and will update this story if it replies with anything other than, "LOL".

            <p>I have a narcissistic recurring daydream that consists of teleporting historical celebrities into the present so that I can show them bits of 21st century technology and absolutely blow their tiny, primordial minds.</p>
<p>"This deceptively pocket-sized contraption is a trillion times more powerful than your silly adding machines," I would tell Charles Babbage, brandishing my smashed Google Pixel phone. "Did the Wright Flyer have wifi?" I would ask Wilbur and Orville, pushing their faces against the window of a 747. "Put this in your pipe and smoke it," I would tell Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, menacing him with the trailer for Silver Palace, a new open world action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Chinese developers Silver Studio and publishers Elementa, which is notionally set in a Victorian metropolis.</p><!--more-->
<p>Silver Palace's Victorian metropolis has red phoneboxes, elegantly appointed trams, top hats, clocktowers, detectives and ballgowns. I imagine Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could just about keep pace with all that, though he might object to the plunging necklines and the overall loudness of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>But then I would show him the angel-winged anime girls, the power-drifting panther steeds, the neck-snapping finishers, the real-time character-swapping, the demons pretending to people who must be exposed using magic profiling functionality. "Why don't your Sherlock Holmes stories have glide mechanics?" I would sternly enquire of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he curled up sobbing into his hands.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one psychic defence would be to point out that his Sherlock Holmes stories don't contain any gacha mechanics, this being a curse peculiar to our so-called modern age. Fine, Doyle, I'll let you have that one. It's not clear what Silver Palace's gacha elements involve, but here's 11 minutes of gameplay overview to give you a sense of the whole.</p>

<p>Some press release blurb to finish: Silver Palace is the tale of Silvernia, a city powered by the "revolutionary element" of Silverium. You are a Detective who must delve into a shady world of corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, and hidden monsters. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be free-to-play.  There's no release date as yet.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the overclocked character designs but I do like the looks of that urban backdrop. Hopefully the open world element is pronounced enough to allow for a Crackdown-style collectathon. Also please may I have some kind of Watson, Silver Studio? Is that catgirl maid the equivalent of Watson in Silver Palace, and if so, can you please make her as creepy as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-2007">Creepy Watson</a> in Frogwares' games?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/powera-ops-v3-pro-wireless-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>PowerA are asking a very specific question with the OPS V3 Pro Wireless Controller – how much RGB is too much RGB? That is, admittedly, a flippant introduction to a controller that sits at the top end of PowerA’s lineup, boasting wireless and wired play for PC and cloud gaming, Hall Effect sensors, mechanical switches, six additional inputs and a magnetic charging base, but when you turn it on, you’ll find that you’re holding one of the brightest, most colourful controllers. Ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerA OPS v3 Pro Wireless Controller for PC and Cloud Gaming with Lumectra" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YauMt7AqZo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m going to deal with the RGB first, as it is genuinely the overarching first impression that this controller gives. Branded with their in-house Lumectra lighting, an RGB strip runs around the perimeter of the OPS, while there’s further RGB lighting around the analogue sticks, the D-pad and each of the four main face buttons. Personally, I think it looks pretty great, though the width of the lighting around each button feels a little bit too wide. Whatever the case, this is a controller that you won’t miss, and especially not in a darkened room.</p>


<p>There is thankfully a lighting button on the back of the controller that lets you turn the effects on and off, as well as tinker with the colourways and lighting, but this is not the most intuitive implementation I’ve ever seen. Part of that is due to the multiple zones of lighting, with several different areas that you can alter, and even when you know what buttons you’re supposed to press, it’s overly fussy to remember it all. That said, you can create some spectacular effects, with each area blending into the next and giving you lots of different combinations. I opted for blue and yellow, and every time I turned it on I was left impressed by the overall look.</p>
<p>Well, I did until the OPS V3 ‘forgot’ my settings, defaulting to pure green a couple of times during my review period. You can fix it using the manual controls, but I imagine there is a point where you will give up and stop readjusting it, even if it doesn’t match your mouse and keyboard anymore.</p>


<p>Beyond the eye-catching lighting effects, the OPS V3 Pro belongs to the school of official Xbox controllers, with the overarching form being nigh-on identical to Microsoft’s timeless creation, and with its two Hall Effect sticks laid out asymmetrically. They feel great in use – taut and precise – and rather than offer the option of different height caps, you can twist each stick into a higher or lower position, giving you extra precision when you want it, and the ability to quickly make adjustments.</p>
<p>The OPS V3 Pro is constructed from solid-feeling black plastic, with texturised grips built into the bottom of each grip. They feel tactile, and grippy, but I did notice an alarming amount of dust and grime building up in them in only a short amount of time. You can clean it easily with a damp cloth, without causing any damage to the internals, but it’s a strange phenomenon that I’ve not seen happen so readily with other controllers. If dust and grime gives you the ick, maybe steer clear.</p>
<p>The stars of the OPS V3 are the mechanical face buttons, shoulder buttons and D-pad. They feel and sound stunning to use, giving you such an immediate response that you can’t help but be delighted with them. I’ve been playing a heap of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> with this gamepad, and all of the platforming and alien combat felt spectacularly tuned in. Returning to Overwatch 2 also showed that the OPS V3 has some competitive chops, and I never once felt that a death was the result of my equipment, rather that it was helping me to get the drop on unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p>That’s helped by the OPS V3’s copious amount of additional inputs. Besides the expected, Xbox-esque main controls, there are six programmable buttons to aid you in whatever fight you’re involved in. Four of them sit in the expected places beneath your fingers as you grip the controller, and they’re of a good size and substantial activation to balance ease of use while avoiding accidental presses.</p>

<p>They’re joined by the unusual placement of two further buttons on the top of the controller, alongside the triggers and beneath the extended reach of the shoulder buttons. Once you’re used to them being there, I actually found these to be the most intuitive and easiest of the extra inputs to use, and thanks to the Program button on the rear of the controller you can change them – and any of the other additional buttons – up at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>My one disappointment with all of these is that they lack the same mechanical switches found in the main buttons. It makes them feel like a downgrade, though I expect that fewer people use these extra buttons compared to the central inputs, and it’s part of PowerA’s attempts to keep the controller’s price down.</p>
<p>The final, and perhaps key, inclusion is trigger lockouts. In my opinion, all controllers need these, and PowerA have opted for a stepped setup that lets you choose from three different trigger input lengths. Once again, they don’t have mechanical activations at the end as we’ve seen with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Gamesir Cyclone</a>, but they’re certainly swift enough, aided no doubt by the magnetic Hall Effect sensors running the show.</p>
<p>The OPS V3 has three different connection modes, with the wired or RF receiver options for PC and Bluetooth for mobile platforms. It’s a real shame that the OPS V3 isn’t certified for Nintendo Switch as well, limiting it compared to some of its key rivals, and also because it’s a well-made, enjoyable controller to use.</p>

<p>The OPS V3 also includes a charging station with a USB-A socket for the RF dongle to sit in. I love this sort of functionality, and anything that makes it easy to keep your peripherals charged is a clear win. However, it’s so small and light, that it just comes away with the controller, and you have to yank it off each time. It’s hardly a problem, but compared to the Gamesir Super Nova or Cyclone, it’s a far more workmanlike solution rather than something to display your fancy new controller.</p>
<p>At £99.99, the OPS V3 straddles the line between affordability and becoming a true premium option, and with its wealth of extra inputs and cool lighting it’ll be a great choice for many players. That said, its feature set puts it in direct competition with Gamesir’s Super Nova and Cyclone, both of which offer more value for money, a better stand, and are overall more comfortable to use.</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> owners will be familiar with the practice of peering into a new game’s Steam store page and hoping, begging, praying to whatever god is yet to abandon this cruel joke of a reality that it has a little green tick mark on it. This is, of course, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-interview">Steam Deck Verified programme</a>, wherein Valve gives good behaviour stickers to games that function fully on their handheld PC.</p>
<p>Soon, this system – so often a source of relief and disappointment – will be expanded, with a view to rating games for compatibility with SteamOS as a whole. As the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">announcement post</a> explains, that’s because the first non-Steam Deck SteamOS handheld, a new version of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-lenovo-legion-go-s-the-steamos-handheld-pc-that-isnt-a-steam-deck">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, is launching soon, with the possibility of more in the future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Valve’s compatibility testing staff presumably can’t try out every game on every possible SteamOS device, no matter how many wheeled desks they can roll into the office, as it's an open-source operating system that could feasibly run on any desktop or laptop. But they can, and apparently will, use data gleaned from their existing Steam Deck Verified testing to determine whether a game has or avoids problems with the OS in particular, subsequently rating it as either SteamOS Compatible or SteamOS Unsupported. With a nice blue tick for the former, aww. As with the current system’s Verified/Playable/Unsupported ratings, these will appear on store game pages and in the Steam libraries of anyone playing on a non-Steam Deck SteamOS PC.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lenovo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"We expect over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS Compatible out of the gate," sayeth the post. While these specific new categories don’t take framerate performance or control input functionality into account, as the Steam Deck ratings do, they should at least let you know if certain games are literal non-starters. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> seems due a SteamOS Unsupported tag, for instance, after it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">binned Linux support last year</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried the Legion Go S yet, and our adoptive cousins at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">Ian Games Network</a> weren’t especially impressed with the Windows edition. But the current state of play among portable PCs definitely has SteamOS above Windows 11 as the more usable, comfortable, lightweight, and stable OS. One that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">surprisingly</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">capable</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-minecraft-on-steam-deck">running</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-battlenet-on-steam-deck">non-Steam</a> games, too. As such, I’ll happily get on board with anything that both makes SteamOS patronship slightly easier and might encourage future handheld manufacturers to switch over. Valve expect as much, writing that "the only other officially supported device running SteamOS is Lenovo Legion Go S, but we see this expanding to more devices in the future."</p>
<p>Exciting times, then, if the concept of the Steam Deck has caught your eye but you’d rather wait and see what other hardware makers can do with a baggable form factor <em>and</em> Valve’s own OS. All that being said, one new, lower-spec handheld does not a sea change make, and the recently leaked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-some-leaked-images-of-an-xbox-branded-handheld-and-the-asus-rog-ally-2">Asus ROG Ally 2</a> looks to remain so tied up in Microsoft’s ecosystem that there’s a separate Xbox-branded version of it. Bet it doesn’t have tiny colourful ticks, mind.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> production capacity and US tariffs didn't factor into sales predictions Nintendo said, as its forecasts were criticised by investors for being conservative.</p>
<p>Following its latest financial report where Nintendo predicted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Switch 2 sales would slightly outsell its predecessor</a>, multiple investors probed the company on why it hadn't estimated higher sales during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf">Q&amp;A</a>.</p>
<p>"We are forecasting Nintendo Switch 2 hardware sales of 15m units for this fiscal year," said Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa. "We set this figure with the aim of reaching the same level of sales we achieved with Nintendo Switch in the roughly 10-month period between its launch in March 2017 and December that year."</p>

<p>The "limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor" in setting the sales volume forecast, he continued, and "the tariff situation in the US or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either".</p>
<p>"Our first goal is to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch, and we are working to strengthen our production capacity so we can respond flexibly to demand," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>In a follow-up question, the president continued: "We recognise the positive feedback from the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and the situation with applications for randomly selected drawings for pre-orders on My Nintendo Store in Japan. But the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so even if there is momentum around the launch, we know it will not be easy to keep that momentum going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond.</p>
<p>"We have been working to ramp up Nintendo Switch 2 hardware production since even before we held the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and began My Nintendo Store applications. Our sales volume forecast was not determined based on any limit to production capacity."</p>
<p>Demand for the Switch 2 in Japan in particular has far exceeded expectations - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Furukawa previously warned of stock issues</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo predicted 45m sales of software in its financial report, but Furukawa noted this figure does not include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> units bundled with the console. Including these units, software sales are expected to surpass the 52m units sold for the original Switch. This is partly due to the "more robust lineup" at launch than the previous console.</p>
<p>Further, Furukawa stated the forecast was calculated maintaining current US tariff rates throughout the fiscal year. This has, however, resulted in a "negative impact of several tens of billions of yen at the profit level". The Switch 2 hardware also has a lower profit margin compared to the original Switch.</p>
<p>Should tariffs change, the company will consider price adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognise them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price," said Furukawa. "However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware. Consequently, if the assumptions on tariffs change, we will consider what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate, taking into account various factors such as the market conditions."</p>
<p>Furukawa's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">echo those of Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser</a>, who admitted tariffs were "something we're going to have to address".</p>
<p>Later, Furukawa also commented on the increased price of hardware and software compared to the previous console.</p>
<p>"When determining hardware prices, we consider not only the manufacturing cost, but also various factors such as consumers' impression of the price, the vast differences in exchange rates compared to the Nintendo Switch launch, and the market conditions in each region," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>"For software, in addition to the same factors, we also take into account rises in costs, due to aspects such as increased game file size and extended development periods, when determining price.</p>
<p>"Going forward, we will continue to consider appropriate prices for each title when it comes to software prices. Hardware involves special factors such as tariffs, and we will take into account factors like those we have just described, while conducting careful and repeated deliberations when determining price."</p>
<p>Bowser previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">higher price tag for Mario Kart World was an example of "variable pricing"</a> and was not establishing a more expensive "benchmark".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ukrainian game developer Frogwares&nbsp;<span>surprised its fans today with the sudden launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sinking City Remastered</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

<p>This remaster leverages Unreal Engine 5 technology to improve the original game's visuals in various ways, as you can see in the trailer below. There are even some gameplay tweaks. Here's the complete list of improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The game is fully relit in Unreal Engine 5</span></li>
<li><span>Enhanced locations with additional levels of detail and objects</span></li>
<li><span>4K textures and improved reflections</span></li>

<p>Sergiy Oganesyan, Publishing Director at Frogwares, teased 'big things' for the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond. So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game’s twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin.</em></p>
<p>Less than two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an exclusive interview with Sergiy Oganesyan on The Sinking City 2. The sequel was funded through Kickstarter with $627K in pledges, which was 450% of the minimum target set by Frogwares. As a reminder, The Sinking City 2 will be a full-fledged survival horror game with greater emphasis on combat. However, Frogwares plans to maintain the investigation mechanics as an optional bonus feature that will make life in the game easier for those who choose to engage with it.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2019, Frogwares gained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frogwares-regain-control-of-the-sinking-city-but-all-old-saves-will-break-soon">full publishing rights to The Sinking City</a> last year following a legal battle with Nacon over royalties and funding, including allegations that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-devs-claim-publisher-pirated-the-game-to-release-it-on-steam">Nacon had pirated the game</a>.

<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) wasn't convinced by The Sinking City's take on Lovecraft or clumsy racism allegories <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-review-pc">in her review</a>, but thought the game worked well enough otherwise, calling it "a slightly janky, slightly grindy detective game that does some interesting things in a very atmospheric depiction of a profoundly depressed town".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> - the apparently very good third-person action extravaganza with a heroine who definitely only dresses like that because she's comfortable with her sexuality and besides, bunny girl outfits are lightweight and tactically efficient - will launch on 11th June, according to a new trailer. PlayStation appear to have posted the trailer early in a classic case of marketing butterfingers. They've now removed the video, but somebody from Reddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/">preserved and uploaded it</a> as an everlasting monument to Sony's shame.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The video walks us through a few of the PC version's new bells, whistles and features, including AI frame generation, higher resolutions, a bunch of bonus outfits, Japanese and Chinese voiceovers, a new boss fight, and ultrawide display support for players who are secretly owls with the ability to rotate their head almost 360 degrees. It all seems very swish. I like the spangly blocking effects.</p>
<p>The PC version of Stellar Blade was confirmed in February, at which time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jiggle-powered-apparently-decent-action-game-stellar-blade-confirmed-for-pc-release-in-june">I wrote a little about the console version's popularity/infamy among internet sexists</a>. To recap: this is very much an experience for people who like looking at shiny bottoms and wobbling chests. It also sounds like an accomplished graduate of Combo, Parry And Fishing Minigame University that deserves a lot of the praise it has received. Ah, history abhors a paradox.</p>
<p>I don't, personally, object to anybody wanting to look at a shiny bottom, providing their enthusiasm for shiny bottoms doesn't metastasise into e.g. the argument that Western civilisation is doomed thanks to a chronic dearth of bikini armour in Assassin's Creed. Anyway, we'll possibly have something less slapdash to say on the subject in June.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em>&nbsp;“The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

The final amount raised in the Kickstarter was 553,100 euros, way above the target of 100,000 euros.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5.1187664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silver-palace-is-a-new-victorian-inspired-f2p-open-world-gacha-game-powered-by-ue5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silver Studio and Elementa have unveiled a new free-to-play open world gacha game called Silver Palace. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game features a rather refreshing Victorian era-inspired setting, albeit still with the anime-like art style we've previously seen in games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-will-soon-require-age-verification-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a>. The game is being developed for PC, console, and mobile devices, and the combination of the reveal trailer and 10-plus-minute-long gameplay showcase has already shown quite a bit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Trailer | The Golden Age of Detectives" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELC4r7fbKEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Additionally, Silver Studio also shared a detailed overview of the features and content:</p>
<p><em>Silver Palace is a brand-new ARPG set in a prosperous metropolis with a Victorian aesthetic. It features an engaging story, a delicate art style, distinctive characters, and a dynamic, action-oriented combat system. Players will play the role of a “Detective” and embark on an adventure with a diverse group of partners to defeat the unknown enemies and unravel the mysteries in Silvernia, an industrialized metropolis built on the power of Silverium.</em></p>
<p><em>The discovery of Silverium was the key to Silvernia’s industrialization. This revolutionary element transformed technology and daily life beyond imagination, attracting numerous residents and fostering innovation. The city became a hub of miracles, driven by the massive industrialization and monetization of Silverlum under the city’s administration.</em></p>
<p><em>In Silver Palace, players assume the role of a “Detective” tasked with investigating crimes and uncovering hidden truths. As various factions—from corporate monopolies and underground syndicates to royal affiliates and cults – vie for control of Silverium, tensions rise across the city.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can switch between characters in real time to unleash powerful skills and chain QTE combos. As they explore the city’s sprawling environments, they’ll dive into the scenes of crime, hunt for clues in the shadow, battle their enemies and in the process reveal more of the stories of Silvernia.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Silver Palace Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIUa74hDJiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-registration for PC and mobile devices (which will likely launch before consoles, as usual with these games) can be submitted <a href="https://silverpalace.elementagames.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official game website</a>.</p>

<p>Not a shield in sight. Just old time, good time, down home rocket communists riding flying machines made of revolver parts, cannibalism, and a "hookshot-hat". Bafflingly, the trailer does not show the hookshot-hat, but I respect the restraint.</p>
<p>The west has been torn apart by the great War For Booze, and your once-idyllic family life has been shattered. So, you hop on your horse and set off to do some gun violence at communists over a series of open sandbox levels. Here are some features:</p>
<p>(Also, here's a grammar question for you, the discerning nitpicker. I always want write to "here's some features" but that's technically not correct because there's multiple features, but "here are some features" just feels so unnecessarily drawn out I want to expire and crumble into dust before I reach the end of the sentence. It's a bloody conundrum, it is! Little insight into the tortuous struggle I experience in the daily process of sausage making, there.)</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Story driven adventure set in open sandbox-like levels.</li>
<li>Dynamic slapstick combat.</li>
<li>Equipment system with upgradeable weapons and clothing.</li>
<li>Trading and cooking systems.</li>
<li>First person rolling, bullet catching, kicking, hookshot-hat, cannibalism, drinking booze and puking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The description of "dynamic slapstick combat" puts me in mind of Blendo Games' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a>. I read something the other day about how one of the purposes of narrative design is to make the things you do in games seem less weird and stupid, but I'm a supporter of leaning into the opposite. I'm also reading Blood Meridian for the first time at the moment, and feel this would make an incredibly incongruent but just similar enough companion piece to make both experiences much stupider.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
