            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Few gaming laptops stand out like Razer’s Blades. They’ve long been the gaming alternative to the MacBook Pro: sleek, powerful, and grown-up looking, without the bulk and garish stylings of most gaming laptops. But cramming powerful graphics cards into slim confines means Blade laptops have a tendency to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review">run hot</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23595235/razer-blade-18-2023-review-specs-13th-gen-performance-nvidia-rtx-4080-qhd-gaming-laptop#:~:text=To%20be%20clear%2C%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20mean%20this%20laptop%20is%20quiet.%20It%E2%80%99s%20loud.%20You%20will%20hear%20the%20fans%20going%20%E2%80%94%20probably%20from%20across%20the%20room%20if%20you%20run%20the%20device%20at%20full%20power%20as%20you%20game.">get loud</a>, and carry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23766755/razer-blade-14-2023-gaming-laptop-review">ridiculous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23588660/razer-blade-16-2023-review-specs-features-design">price tags</a>.</p><p>So you’d be excused for feeling anxious that the 2025 Blade 16, which offers Nvidia’s most powerful laptop GPU, is 30 percent thinner and significantly lighter than its predecessor. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price">my initial testing,</a> it only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs">seemed a little more powerful</a> than the 4090 Blade it replaces.</p><p>But now I’ve used it much more extensively. I’ve even tested it against cheaper, thicker RTX 5080 laptops with more cooling capacity, which are the better buy if you’re focused squarely on gaming performance. However, nothing quite matches the Blade 16’s balance of top-end specs, thin chassis with all-black aesthetics, and a lovely OLED screen I’d happily stare at all day.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4900</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great fit, finish, and build</li><li>Slim and sleek design for a gaming laptop</li><li>Excellent OLED screen comes standard</li><li>Very good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Starts expensive and gets expensive-er</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Thinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model</li><li>A cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent</li><li>The matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The 2025 Blade 16 is just 0.69 inches at its thickest (0.59 inches at the front) and weighs 4.6 pounds. That isn’t just thinner and lighter than last year’s 0.87-inch / 5.4-pound Blade 16, it’s also a bit lighter than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> — though the Pro is slightly thinner overall, at 0.61 inches. And it’s priced like a MacBook Pro: the Blade 16 <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05287EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored">starts at $2,999.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti</a> graphics card.</p><p>Before Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645276/razer-blade-gaming-laptops-sales-pause-us-tariffs">removed its US preorder pages and pricing</a> and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651199/razer-blade-16-laptop-sales-resume-us-tariffs">brought some of them back</a> amid April’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">ongoing tariff chaos</a>, our review unit, with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU, 32GB of RAM, 2TB SSD, and a Nvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU, was listed at $4,499. That configuration isn’t listed anymore, and the only model with a 5090 now costs $4,899 but comes with twice the RAM and storage. It’s not clear how much this configuration of the Blade 16 will cost or if it will be available. But one thing is certain: the Blades will stay expensive.</p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2><strong>Component report card:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic: </strong>B</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Touchpad:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 2</span></li></ul></div></div><p>All models of the 2025 Blade 16 come with an excellent 16-inch, 240Hz, and 2560 x 1600 OLED display. With superb color contrast and sharp looks, it’s one of the laptop’s strongest assets. It’s not as high-res as the 16-inch MacBook Pro’s 3456 x 2234 mini-LED, but its variable 240Hz refresh is twice that of the Mac’s. </p><p>And the rest of the Blade 16’s hardware feels “pro” without losing sight of its gaming focus. It has two USB 4 ports (one on each side), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, a full-size UHS-II SD card reader, and a proprietary charging port with a reversible plug. It’s the same connector as last gen, though the power brick is now 280W instead of 330W.</p><div id=":Rmbdcer6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The front of the Razer is slightly thinner than the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it gets thicker by its midpoint.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The fact that Apple calls this color “black,” when compared to the Blade, is comical.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The Blade’s 1080p webcam looks good enough and handles mixed and low lighting just fine, though it’s missing the privacy shutter from last year. Its six-speaker setup gets very loud and sounds pretty full, though a bit muddy compared to the MacBook Pro. The keyboard has deeper key travel and more tactile feedback than a MacBook’s, and its trackpad is equally humongous — though its top-hinged design is only okay compared to Apple’s excellent haptic trackpads. Razer’s trackpad is so large I was at first prone to accidental clicks with my palms, but I adjusted to it, just as I had to learn to not hit the mic mute key on the right-hand macro key column when aiming for the arrow keys. And while these components don’t always match Apple’s in terms of quality, they’re a cut above most other gaming laptops.</p><p>Last year’s thicker Blade had surprisingly good heat management compared to earlier models, so I was worried that the thinner 2025 model would be a step backward. Instead, it’s a small step forward, with caveats. The 5090 model has between 5 and 20 percent higher frame rates than the 4090 in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong, </em>while staying around 4.5 degrees Celsius cooler, with an average GPU temperature of 81C compared to 86C. The chassis never got uncomfortable; I even played games with it on my lap without any problems (though I’ll likely feel different in the sweltering summer months).</p><p>Since my initial testing, I’ve also been using the <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Laptop/AORUS-MASTER-16-AM6H#kf">Gigabyte Aorus Master 16</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nr0ld1-m005n0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a> — both configured with the RTX 5080 (the next GPU down from the 5090), both much thicker than the Blade 16 and both at least $1,000 cheaper. In a volley of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmarks at 4K and 2.5K, the Blade 16’s average frame rates were at most 3 to 7fps higher (up to 27 with 4x frame generation), putting the 5080 nearly on par with the last-gen flagship RTX 4090 Blade 16. Both thicker laptops pushed the RTX 5080 past 140W, with average GPU temperatures of 76C.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>From top to bottom: Razer Blade 16 (RTX 5090), MacBook Pro 16 (M4 Max), Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 (RTX 5080), Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 (RTX 5080), and Razer Blade 16 (RTX 4090)</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>Razer says the Blade 16’s total graphics power for sustained workloads is 135W, and Nvidia Dynamic Boost can push that to 160W in short bursts by pulling power from the CPU’s allowance. But the RTX 5090 can draw up to 150W, so it’s possible the RTX 5090 will perform better in a laptop with more cooling capacity. But I tested the Blade 16 with Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb">Laptop Cooling Pad, which lets the Blade’s GPU pull closer to 150W</a>; unfortunately, even though the GPU stayed around 9C cooler, it didn’t make any consistent difference in frame rates, and the loud cooling fan drove me up the wall.</p><p>Even the fastest laptop GPU is constrained by the power and cooling capacity of the laptop it’s in. The RTX 5090 laptop GPU in the Blade 16 is about on par with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">a desktop RTX 5070</a>, so it’s right at home with the Blade’s 2560 x 1600 native resolution, and using Nvidia’s DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen software can help it take advantage of that 240Hz display — especially on the most graphically intense games. </p><p>For example, with DLSS and Multi Frame Gen, I was able to average 146fps in the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nvidia/628796/half-life-2-rtx-remix-nvidia-demo"><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> demo</a> at native 2.5K resolution using ultra settings. It was a graphical feast of volumetric lighting and path-traced reflections. Nvidia’s software tricks can sometimes cause <a href="https://youtu.be/QHRS0TO89UI?si=lZnMtED7wXHA8yGu&amp;t=776">small artifacting</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/xpzufsxtZpA?si=09GBCKtpAafpCCRZ&amp;t=668">a little input latency</a>. But, frankly, if you’re not the type to go pixel-peeping, you’ll likely appreciate the smooth performance at high resolutions more than you’ll notice an innocuous anomaly like a small bit of smearing or ghosting.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Blades definitely get their inspiration from somewhere. Where could that be?</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Personally, I’m cool with using DLSS and frame generation for single-player games, because being able to crank something like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to maxed-out “overdrive” settings with full path tracing and 151 average frames per second is just lovely. But it isn’t magic: if a game isn’t running smoothly before frame generation, it’ll still feel like a choppy mess afterward, even if Multi Frame Gen pushes it over 60fps. To play at 4K — on an external monitor or the screen on the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619052/razer-blade-18-nvidia-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-preorder-asus-msi">Razer Blade 18</a> — you’ll probably still have to turn some settings down.</p><p>The Blade 16’s gaming performance on battery is pretty good, but the experience varies by game. Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Fbattery-boost%2F" rel="sponsored">Battery Boost</a> uses just enough of the Blade’s power to target 60fps and lowers it to 30 during non-action moments like cutscenes and map displays. Using the Nvidia app’s optimized settings, I was able to get a little over 90 minutes of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a charge and nearly two hours of <em>Elden Ring </em>on another. But <em>Cyberpunk </em>was set to low without ray tracing, running with DLSS 4 set to ultra performance mode and averaging 120fps thanks to 4x Multi Frame Gen (so around 30fps if you exclude AI frames). <em>Elden Ring, </em>which doesn’t support DLSS, averaged just 38fps.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Despite being thinner this year, the Blade 16 still has just as many ports.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>While running either game, the GPU was limited to 30W and the CPU around 10W — I didn’t even hear the fans. By comparison, while plugged in, <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s one-click optimization uses a mix of high and ultra settings, complete with ray tracing and balanced DLSS. That yields an average 179fps with the GPU getting 114W and the CPU at 36W. The fans run loud, but not enough to be a nuisance. Games look <em>so</em> much better plugged in, and games are probably why you’re spending $4,500 here.</p><p>That plugged-in performance does also translate to the Blade’s content-creation prowess. It ran our Premiere Pro 4K export test in one minute, 56 seconds — 17 seconds faster than Apple’s 16-inch M4 Pro laptop ($3,349 as tested), though 38 seconds slower than the M4 Max model ($6,149 as tested).</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2025) / RTX 5090 / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2024) / RTX 4090 / Core i9 14900HX / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Pro / 14C / 20C / 48GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>MacBook Pro 16-inch M4 Max / 16C / 40C / 128GB / 4TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>2968</td><td>2922</td><td>3113</td><td>3976</td><td>4011</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>15922</td><td>17606</td><td>19709</td><td>22615</td><td>26422</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>213016</td><td>187733</td><td>200189</td><td>70018</td><td>115870</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>119</td><td>125</td><td>137</td><td>179</td><td>182</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1287</td><td>1505</td><td>1965</td><td>1744</td><td>2043</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Premiere Pro</td><td>12593</td><td>12239</td><td>13409</td><td>8914</td><td>12400</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>8679</td><td>8149</td><td>8482</td><td>12374</td><td>13424</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD reads (MB/s)</td><td>6726.25</td><td>6654.46</td><td>6832.06</td><td>6737.84</td><td>7340.85</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD writes (MB/s)</td><td>4931.41</td><td>4942.02</td><td>6550.21</td><td>7499.56</td><td>7969.07</td></tr><tr><td>Blender classroom test (seconds, lower is better)</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>not tested</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy</td><td>22498</td><td>19818</td><td>20977</td><td>not tested</td><td>not tested</td></tr><tr><td>Premiere 4K Export (lower is better)</td><td>1 minute, 56 seconds</td><td>not tested</td><td>not tested</td><td>2 minutes, 13 seconds</td><td>1 minute, 18 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br>It’s a decent alternative to the MacBook Pro for content creation, and far exceeds it in gaming, but the Blade lags far behind in battery life. Not just behind the MacBook Pro — which can get up to 18 hours on battery — but even behind other Windows gaming laptops. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a>, with the same Strix Point CPU and an RTX 4070 GPU, lasted over eight hours in mixed non-gaming use. The Blade couldn’t make it six under the same conditions, even with its screen set to 60Hz. I eventually got it through an eight-hour workday by enabling Windows 11’s Energy Saver mode the whole time. It wasn’t perceptibly slower during a relatively light day of Slack, Google Docs, and a one-hour Google Meet call, but Energy Saver limits background app activity, so it could possibly hinder heavier multitasking.</p><p>There’s no getting around the fact that Windows laptops deliver less power on battery. On battery power, I can feel sluggishness in Lightroom Classic when the Blade 16 uses integrated graphics to save battery. Macs don’t have that issue. Forcing Windows to use the discrete GPU made it speedy again, but importing around 2,000 RAW files and doing light editing on just half of them used 25 percent of the Blade’s battery in under an hour. If I do that on a MacBook Pro, I’m usually done editing well before I even worry about plugging in.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>There are five Torx screws to remove the Blade’s bottom plate.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>There’s still nothing quite like the Blade 16. It’s the well-fitting black T-shirt to the try-hard tacticool cargo pants of other gaming laptops, and it’s still the closest thing you’ll find to a MacBook Pro for gaming. The battery life is middling and the price for the 5090 version is obscene, but laptop gamers always pay a premium for portability.</p><p>The biggest hangup with the 5090 version of the Blade 16 is that the 5080 is breathing down its neck for $1,000 less. We don’t know yet if the Blade’s thinness is holding the 5090 back — not until I test a Blade with the 5080 or another 5090 laptop with more thermal headroom. Regardless, Razer aimed to make the Blade 16 a return to form, and it delivered.</p><div><div><p id="2025-razer-blade-16-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>2025 Razer Blade 16 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>16-inch (2560 x 1600) 240Hz OLED</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia RTX 5090</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB LPDDR5X (soldered)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 2TB M.2 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe (with one extra slot)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 3x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 2x USB4 Type-C, SD card slot (UHS-II), HDMI 2.1</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.71 pounds</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 — 0.69 inches</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 90Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $4,499.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

When you think (most) Nintendo games, you think bright, vibrant, and exciting. And thankfully, <em>Mario Kart World</em> still looks like a wonderful Nintendo game. It’s just running at a much higher resolution and as a result, everything looks clearer and sharper. Wario’s mustache and Toad’s weird mushroom head (hat?) have never looked this good before! </p><p>So we wrangled up 12 new screenshots directly from Nintendo that made us go “Wow!” and tossed them into a slideshow so you all can enjoy them, too.

<p dir="auto">Assassin’s Creed titles are cozy games for me. There’s no more relaxing place to go after a difficult day: historical outdoor museum tours, plus dopamine dispensers, plus slow-paced assassination simulators. The developers of <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em> seem to understand this need to escape better than ever before.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’m “only” 40 hours into <em>Shadows</em> (I reckon I’m only about 30 percent through the game), but I already consider it one of the best entries in the franchise’s long history.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve appreciated some past titles’ willingness to experiment and get jazzy with it, but <em>Shadows</em> takes a different tack. It has cherry-picked the best elements from the past decade or so of the franchise and refined them.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, although the wheel hasn’t been reinvented here, it offers a smoother ride than fans have ever gotten from the series.</p>
<p dir="auto">That’s a relief, and for once, I have some praise to offer Ubisoft. It has done an excellent job understanding its audience and proven that when in doubt, AAA publishers should feel more comfortable with the idea of delaying a game to focus on quality.</p>
<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="Choosing wisely">Choosing wisely</h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Shadows</em> is the latest entry in the 18-year series, and it was developed primarily by a Ubisoft superteam, combining the talents of two flagship studios: Ubisoft Montreal (<em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>) and Ubisoft Quebec (<em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>, <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising</em>).</p>
<p dir="auto">After a mediocre entry in 2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>—which began as <em>Valhalla</em> DLC and was developed by B-team Ubisoft Bordeaux—<em>Shadows</em> is an all-in, massive budget monstrosity led by the very A-list of teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">The game comes after a trilogy of games that many fans call the ancient trilogy (<em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, and <em>Valhalla</em>—with <em>Mirage</em> tightly connected), which was pretty divisive.</p>
<p dir="auto">Peaking with <em>Odyssey</em>, the ancient trilogy departed from classic Assassin's Creed gameplay in significant ways. For the most part, cornerstones like social stealth, modern-day framing, and primarily urban environments were abandoned in favor of what could be reasonably described as "<em>The Witcher 3 </em>lite"—vast, open-world RPG gameplay with detailed character customization and gear systems, branching dialogue options, and lots of time spent wandering the wilderness instead of cities.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/i-played-11-assassins-creed-games-in-11-years-and-odyssey-made-them-all-worth-it/">I loved that shift</a>, as I felt the old formula had grown stale over a decade of annual releases. Many other longtime fans did not agree. So in the weeks leading up to <em>Shadows</em>' launch, Ubisoft was in a tough spot: please the old-school fans or fans of the ancient trilogy. The publisher tried to please both at once with <em>Valhalla</em> but ended up not really making anyone happy, and it tried a retro throwback with <em>Mirage</em>, which was well-received by a dedicated cohort, but that didn't make many waves outside that OG community.</p>
<p dir="auto">During development, a Ubisoft lead publicly assured fans that <em>Shadows</em> would be a big departure from <em>Odyssey</em>, seemingly letting folks know which fanbase the game was meant to please. That's why I was surprised when <em>Shadows</em> actually came out and was... a lot like <em>Odyssey</em>—more like <em>Odyssey</em> than any other game in the franchise, in fact.</p>

<p dir="auto">Similar to <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Shadows</em> has deep character progression, gear, and RPG systems. It is also far more focused on the countryside than on urban gameplay and has no social stealth. It has branching dialogue (anemic though that feature may be) and plays like a modernization of <em>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Yet it seems this time around, most players are happy. What gives?</p>
<p dir="auto">Well, <em>Shadows</em> exhibits a level of polish and handcrafted care that many <em>Odyssey</em> detractors felt was lacking. In other words, the game is so slick and fun to play, it's hard to dislike it just because it's not exactly what <em>you</em> would have done had you been in charge of picking the next direction for the franchise.</p>
<p dir="auto">Part of that comes from learning lessons from the specific complaints that even <em>Odyssey</em>'s biggest fans had about that game, but part of it can be attributed to the fact that Ubisoft did something uncharacteristic this time around: It delayed an Assassin's Creed game for months to make sure the team could nail it.</p>

<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="It’s OK to delay">It’s OK to delay</h2>
<p dir="auto">Last fall, Ubisoft published <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, which was basically Assassin's Creed set in the Star Wars universe. You'd think that would be a recipe for success, but the game landed with a thud. The critical reception was lukewarm, and gaming communities bounced off it quickly. And while it sold well by most single-player games' standards, it didn't sell well enough to justify its huge budget or to please either Disney or Ubisoft's bean counters.</p>
<p dir="auto">I played <em>Outlaws</em> a little bit, but I, too, dropped it after a short time. The stealth sequences were frustrating, its design decisions didn't seem very well-thought out, and it wasn't that fun to play.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since I wasn't alone in that impression, Ubisoft looked at <em>Shadows</em> (which was due to launch mere weeks later) and panicked. Was the studio on the right track? It made a fateful decision: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-after-poor-star-wars-outlaws-reception/">delay <em>Shadows</em> for months</a>, well beyond the quarter, to make sure it wouldn't disappoint as much as <em>Outlaws</em> did.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not privy to the inside discussions about that decision, but given that the business was surely counting on <em>Shadows</em> to deliver for the all-important holiday quarter and that Ubisoft had never delayed an Assassin's Creed title by more than a few weeks before, it probably wasn't an easy one.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's hard to imagine it was the wrong one, though. Like I said, <em>Shadows</em> might be the most polished and consistently fun Assassin's Creed game ever made.</p>

<p dir="auto">In an industry where quarterly profits are everything and building quality experiences for players or preserving the mental health and financial stability of employees are more in the "it's nice when it happens" category, I feel it's important to recognize when a company makes a better choice.</p>
<p dir="auto">I don't know what Ubisoft developers' internal experiences were, but I sincerely hope the extra time allowed them to both be happier with their work and their work-life balance. (If you're reading this and you work at Ubisoft and have insight, email me via my author page here. I want to know.)</p>

<p dir="auto">In any case, there's no question that players got a superior product because of the decision to delay the game. I can think of many times when players got angry at publishers for delaying games, but they shouldn't be. When a game gets delayed, that's not necessarily a bad sign. The more time the game spends in the oven, the better it's going to be. Players should welcome that.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, too, should business leaders at these publishers. Let <em>Shadows</em> be an example: Getting it right is worth it.</p>


<h2 dir="auto" data-heading="More dad rock, less prestige TV">More dad rock, less prestige TV</h2>
<p dir="auto">Of course, despite this game's positive reception among many fans, Assassin’s Creed in general is often reviled by some critics and gamers. Sure, there’s a reasonable and informed argument to be made that its big-budget excess, rampant commercialism, and formulaic checkbox-checking exemplify everything wrong with the AAA gaming industry right now.</p>
<p dir="auto">And certainly, there have been entries in the franchise's long history that lend ammunition to those criticisms. But since <em>Shadows</em> is good, this is an ideal time to discuss why the franchise (and this entry in particular) deserves more credit than it sometimes gets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's use a pop culture analogy.</p>
<p dir="auto">In its current era, Assassin’s Creed is like the video game equivalent of the bands U2 or Tool. People call those “dad rock.” Taking a cue from those folks, I call <em>Shadows</em> and other titles like it (<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Starfield</em>) “dad games.”</p>
<p dir="auto">While the kids are out there seeking fame through competitive prowess and streaming in <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> or building chaotic metaverses in <em>Roblox</em> and—well, also <em>Fortnite</em>—games like <em>Shadows</em> are meant to appeal to a different sensibility. It’s one that had its heyday in the 2000s and early 2010s, before the landscape shifted.</p>
<p dir="auto">We’re talking single-player games, cutting-edge graphics showcases, and giant maps full of satisfying checklists.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a time when all the biggest games are multiplayer games-as-a-service, when many people are questioning whether graphics are advancing rapidly enough to make them a selling point on their own, and when checklist design is maligned by critics in favor of more holistic ideas, <em>Shadows</em> represents an era that may soon by a bygone one.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p dir="auto">So, yes, given the increasingly archaic sensibility in which it’s rooted and the current age of people for whom that era was prime gaming time, the core audience for <em>Shadows</em> probably now includes a whole lot of dads and moms.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>The graphics are simply awesome.</span>

<p dir="auto">There's a time and a place for pushing the envelope or experimenting, but media that deftly treads comfortable ground doesn't get enough appreciation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Around the time Ubisoft went all-in on this formula with <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>, lots of people sneered, saying it was like watered-down <em>The</em> <em>Witcher 3</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Those games from CD Projekt Red and Rockstar Games moved things forward, while Ubisoft's games seemed content to stay in proven territory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Those people tended to look at this from a business point of view: Woe is an industry that avoids bold and challenging choices for fear of losing an investment. But playing it safe can be a good experience for players, and not just because it allows developers to deliver a refined product.</p>
<p dir="auto">Safety is the point. Yeah, I appreciate something that pushes the envelope in production values and storytelling. If <em>The Witcher 3</em> and <em>RDR2</em> were TV shows, we’d call them “prestige TV”—a type of show that’s all about expanding and building on what television can be, with a focus on critical acclaim and cultural capital.</p>
<p dir="auto">I, too, enjoy prestige shows like HBO’s <em>The White Lotus</em>. But sometimes I have to actually work on getting myself in the mood to watch a show like that. When I’ve had a particularly draining day, I don’t want challenging entertainment. That’s when it’s time to turn on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> or <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>—unchallenging or nostalgic programming that lets me zone out in my comfort zone for a while.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's what Assassin's Creed has been for about a decade now—comfort gaming for a certain audience. Ubisoft knows that audience well, and the game is all the more effective because the studios that made it were given the time to fine-tune every part of it <em>for</em> that audience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> isn't groundbreaking, and that's OK, because it's a hundred hours of fun and relaxation. It's definitely not prestige gaming. It’s dad gaming: comfortable, refined, a little corny, but satisfying. If that's what you crave with your limited free time, it's worth a try.</p>

                <p>Star Wars Celebration has kicked off in Japan, and one of the highlights so far is the announcement of a new film in the sci-fi series that'll be directed by Shawn Levy (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>) and will star Ryan Gosling. Star Wars: Starfighter was revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-the-mandalorian-and-grogu-footage-revealed-at-d23/1100-6525692/" data-ref-id="1100-6525692">The Mandalorian and Grogu panel</a>, and it is scheduled to be released on May 31, 2027.</p><p>While details are slim for now, what we do know is that Starfighter is set five years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and Gosling will play a brand-new character. In case you're wondering, Star Wars: Starfighter shares nothing--that we know of, so far--with the video game of the same name released for PC, PS2, and Xbox in 2001. The game is currently available on PC platforms like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32350/STAR_WARS_Starfighter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=New+Ryan+Gosling+Star+Wars+Movie+Has+Same+Name+As+This+Great+PS2+Game&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-04-18+06%3A08%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-18+06%3A09%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6530960&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fstar_wars_starfighter&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-ryan-gosling-star-wars-movie-has-same-name-as-this-great-ps2-game%2F1100-6530960%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, in case you want to revisit it.</p><p>The obvious difference here is the setting, as the Starfighter video game was set during the prequel trilogy, specifically the invasion of Naboo that took place during Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Similar to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Starfighter featured arcade-influenced action, and players could hop into several different spaceships.</p><p>A sequel, Jedi Starfighter, was released in 2002 and was set during the events of the second Star Wars prequel, Attack of the Clones. The games are also set during the Legends era of Star Wars, a different continuity than the one used by Disney following its purchase of the Star Wars IP several years later.</p><p>Beyond the reveal of the Starfighter film, the first day of Star Wars Celebration had a few more announcements. Former Sith lord Maul will headline a new animated series set after the final season of the Clone Wars, and it will chart his rise to power in the criminal underworld. There was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/AgJftuOvyis" rel="nofollow ">sneak peek at The Mandalorian and Grogu</a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/68YdtaKRO7M" rel="nofollow ">second season of the documentary Light and Magic</a> was announced, and the second expansion for Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://youtu.be/Urp3XfddqZs" rel="nofollow ">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, will be out on May 15.</p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is setting out to be the true definitive edition of the classic role-playing game by Bethesda, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k1gyxd/lord_cognito_of_defining_duke_podcast_i_have_it/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, Lord Cognito, who has proven reliable in the past, revealed on the latest episode of the Defining Duke podcast, which has yet to be made available publicly, that all the DLC packs released for the original game will be included in Oblivion Remastered. This is definitely great news if true, considering their high quality.</p>
<p>Rumored to be in the works by Virtuos for a very long time, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was essentially confirmed to be real <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">earlier this week</a> with a bunch of screenshots that leaked via the developer's official website. While details remain scarce as of now, there's a very high chance it won't be long before players will be able to experience this highly anticipated remaster themselves, as multiple insiders have suggested that it will be released sometime <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">next week.</a></p>
<p>With details being scarce, we have no idea what Oblivion Remastered will offer, besides the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-restored-screenshots/">improved visuals</a> powered by Unreal Engine 5. According to a report from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">earlier this year</a>, the remaster will also sport plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay tweaks</a>, which should improve the experience considerably.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-20-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CI Games has released&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 update, representing what the developer and publisher calls the "definitive edition" of its game. As you'd expect, it's packing plenty of improvements.</p>

<p>The release of&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update-15-modifiers" rel="nofollow">many updates</a> the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-update" rel="nofollow">received</a> since its launch back in October 2023, mean that CI Games has "aligned the game with our original vision", the developer says.</p>

<p>Changes include shared progression co-op, which allows players to play together across a shared campaign, as well as a free friend's pass. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">friend's pass offered by Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>, this pass allows a friend to experience the game alongside you for free, even if they don't own&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to changes like a new lamp guidance mechanic, which allows you to find the nearest Vestige so you can get some respite from your adventure, as well as a dedicated jump button, an overhauled character creator, and much more.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>'s 2.0 update, including other changes we haven't covered in our brief highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1501750/view/527592442371768508" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can be found here</a>, and you can check out a trailer spotlighting some of the game's new features below.</p>




<p>Despite its name,&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>2.0 isn't actually a sequel to <i>Lords of the Fallen</i>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch 2, and the game's major second DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, has also been revealed.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">during a livestream</a>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Nintendo's console on September 4th. The console itself is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due for launch on June 5th</a>, so you won't have to wait too long between buying your Switch 2 and picking up Ubisoft's open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>adventure.</p>

<p>If you already own&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and you're waiting for news of the next DLC adventure, Ubisoft has you covered on that front as well.&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>is the name of the game's second story pack, and it's coming in May.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=JcFN7WgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-a-pirates-fortune.jpg?itok=jLHc3OZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' second DLC,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, is due out in May.</figcaption></figure><p>Arriving on May 15th,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>takes Kay Vess to the Khepi system, where she'll be teaming up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka in order to take on Stinger Tash and her mean-sounding Rokana Raiders.</p>

<p>In true pirate fashion, you'll also be raiding a tomb; the Khepi Tomb will offer "secrets and hidden treasures" for you to discover. What's more, a whole new faction, the Miyuki Trade League, will offer up new Trailblazer rewards, and all you have to do in return is smuggle dangerous goods across the galaxy. What's new, right?</p>

<p>Along with the paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will also be getting some free&nbsp;<em>Skeleton Crew</em>-inspired cosmetics on May 15th, including an outfit for Nix. Be sure to check that out if you want to dress up your cute little friend.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft. Taking place between&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she tries to pull off the heist of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Originally released last year, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Ubisoft's expectations</a>, becoming one of the cornerstones of a change in strategy that involves day-one Steam releases and the adoption of an altered season pass model.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Erren liked it</a>, though, and if you want to find out whether you do, there's a free demo for the game you can check out across all platforms.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9P87S3NP6SR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Switch 2 version launches on September 4th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-definitive-edition-has-become-more-immersive-than-ever-thanks-to-new-vr-mod.1167735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-immersive-vr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Definitive Edition has become more immersive than ever before this week, thanks to a new VR mod that's now available for download.</p>
<p>The new mod, which has been developed by Holydh and is now available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/grandtheftautothetrilogy/mods/922">Nexus Mods</a>, includes everything players need to play San Andreas Definitive Edition in first-person VR with 6DOF motion controls. Thanks to the implementation of 6DOF controls in particular, it's possible to play the game from beginning to end in VR, as they allow the aiming of all ranged weapons, even in scripted shooting sequences in vehicles as a passenger. The functional Sniper Scope and Camera Screen with zoom in and out function also allows specific weapons that require using a sniper rifle to be completed in VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="San Andreas VR with 6DOF motion controls - UEVR Plugin Released" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIVeUHKR9S0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release of this VR mod definitely makes the purchase of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Definitive Edition more enticing for those who still prefer the original release, although the game, much like GTA 3 and Vice City Definitive Editions, has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">considerable improvements</a> since its launch in late 2021. You can learn more about the issues that plagued Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition at launch by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>

		<p>Following on from last month’s reveal, 3D Realms and Saber Interactive have released a brand new trailer for Painkiller with this one focusing specifically on weapons. The trailer confirms there are seven weapons in total for players to use including the Stakegun, Electrodriver, SMG, Handcannon, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and of course the titular Painkiller.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J41CouSSWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Stakegun impales foes with with high damage stakes, the Electrodriver fires off shurikens that will bounce off surfaces, the SMG fires lots of bullets in bursts, the Shotgun will deal high damage close up and staggers foes, the Handcannon hits hard from distance, the Rocket Launcher takes out groups, and the Painkiller hooks on to enemies and shreds them up.&nbsp; All of the weapons will have primary and alternative fire modes along with upgrades with bonuses, and elemental rounds including &nbsp;fire, ice, electro and kinetic.</p>
<p>Painkiller’s story puts you in Purgatory where you have been given a chance to redeem yourself after transgressing against Heaven. The way to redeem yourself is by blasting away the demons of purgatory in an attempt to stop the fallen angel Azazel’s invasion of Earth. Painkiller can be playable solo and will also support co-op for up to three players. Painkiller is due to release this autumn for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-%E2%80%93-what-switch-games-can%E2%80%99t-be-played.1167717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is backwards compatible with most older Switch titles, but not all of them. Nintendo have categorised all the games they have tested into three groups: ‘Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2’, ‘Games that are playable, but have some in-game compatibility issues’, and ‘Games with issues that are planned to be addressed’. Additionally there is a small number of games that will work but not with the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers, you will need a Switch 1 Joy-Con to play them.</p>
<p>Why are there any issues here? Well, it comes down to a few different reasons. The Switch 2 Joy-Con no longer have an IR sensor, which means games that use this won’t work for those select minigames and modes, and the physical size is different for attachments like the Ring Fit controller. More fundamentally, the Switch 2 is using a translation layer to run original Switch games, and this can cause issues if certain CPU and GPU functions are changed or were used in unusual ways.</p>
<p>Here is a full list of the games that have been tested and their category, but please be aware this list may change as Nintendo continue to test games and work with developers to resolve issues. Check the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Site</a> for the latest updates.</p>


<h2>Games that cannot be played on Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit <em>– the Switch 2 cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles, so this cannot be played.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Games that require Nintendo Switch Joy-Con to play</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ring Fit Adventure</li>
<li>1-2-Switch</li>
<li>Everybody 1-2-Switch!</li>

</ul>
<h3>Nintendo Switch games with issues that are planned to be addressed</h3>
<p>The issues with the following games have been found and the developers are busy working on a patch or new version. You will note that Fortnite is one of them, one the games used to promote Switch 2! We believe this is down to the Switch 1 build having issues, while a Switch 2 native version of the game will be the recommended way to play.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortnite</li>
<li>Fitness Boxing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>
<p>These games have been tested and currently are not booting correctly on Switch 2 and therefore cannot be played. However, for all of the titles Nintendo state that “This issue is being investigated” so they may be patched at a later date.</p>

			<p>A new Hogwarts Legacy patch has gone live on PC, introducing ray tracing and stability improvements as well as new features that may bring performance improvements for GPUs that don't support NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The April 17th patch introduces, besides some UI improvements, some ray tracing improvements, such as fixed Hogsmeade watermill shadow not rotating with asset and ray-traced reflections system resolution issues, stability and performance improvements, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeLL and XeFG support, meaning that users that cannot use NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation now have the option of using either AMD or Intel's tech, depending on their GPU.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/17/john-wick-inspired-action-game-spine-coming-to-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Spine was first announced in 2021 as a multiplayer game, but after a couple of years in development, developer Nekki changed course. Today, Spine is a cinematic single-player game that draws heavy inspiration from action-packed blockbusters like&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>​​​​​​. Using free-flow gun-fu combat, Spine has drawn the attention of a large population of players, attracting more than 400,000 wishlists according to the publisher. Today, Nekki showed off new gameplay footage of the cyberpunk action title, announced a new ultra-difficult Hardcore mode, and shared that the game will arrive on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>In Spine, you control Redline, the highly trained protagonist who can seamlessly move from enemy to enemy by parrying them, disarming them, and defeating them with her weapons, in hand-to-hand combat, or by turning their own weapons against them. She can also resourcefully use items in the environment as makeshift weapons and smash enemies into various surfaces in the world. The camera is specifically designed to put the player in the action so they feel like they are in an action movie.</p>

<p>In addition to announcing that the game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, Nekki also revealed Hardcore mode. In this mode, Redline cannot take any damage, which is represented by a special pair of sunglasses she wears in this mode. In order to keep the sunglasses intact, she must make it through untouched by enemy fire or strikes.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer showing off the combat below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZbHDdd5drA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Freeflow Gun Fu combat means constant tactical awareness – both of your enemies and of the surroundings in which you fight," game director Dmitry Pimenov said in a press release. "For us, everything comes back to that cinematic experience, while always giving players complete control. We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action."</p>

<p>Spine doesn't currently have a release date, but it was originally scheduled for a 2025 release. However, the Steam page currently says "To be announced," while the press release makes no mention of a release window. It is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/mario-kart-world-modes-and-courses-detailed-free-roam-features-missions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mario Kart World is Nintendo's big launch title for Nintendo Switch 2, and for good reason. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/mario_kart_8_deluxe/b/switch/archive/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-game-informer-review.aspx">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, despite being an enhanced version of a Wii U game, has sold nearly 70 million copies, making it one of the five best-selling video games of all time, and the franchise typically lands in the top five best-selling games on nearly every system it appears on. Naturally, Nintendo sees the first all-new Mario Kart game in more than a decade as a big-ticket item, which could explain the $80 price tag. However, it also explains the confidence Nintendo has to launch the successor to its most successful console of all time with Mario Kart World. During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we learned how players can engage with the big launch title of Nintendo Switch 2, as Nintendo detailed the various modes, as well as several of the courses.</p>

<p>Grand Prix</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="9d8a3a5b-fd7a-43b6-871d-b7b88ad76778" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Grand Prix</h4>

<p>As I experienced during my hands-on time with Mario Kart World (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">read my full preview here</a>), the game features two flagship modes: Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix sets you up with a series of four races as you try and place well enough that you land on the podium at the end of the four races. Players can race through new and returning courses (see below), but the difference in Mario Kart World is that once you complete a race, you then drive to the next course alongside your opponents, hammering home the fact that this is one big, interconnected world. Grand Prix organizes the courses into four-race Cups, with seven Cups available – Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, Shell Cup, Banana Cup, Leaf Cup, and Lightning Cup. However, the Direct heavily implies that if you take home gold in all seven Cups, you will at least unlock Rainbow Road, though it's more likely you'll unlock an entire Special Cup.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3a45d463-4a07-4cf2-97ea-40d866b52163" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Knockout Tour</h4>

<p>The other big mode Nintendo has shown is Knockout Tour. Here, you race in elimination matches across multiple checkpoints. Each time you pass through a checkpont, you must be better than the position shown in the checkpoint gate or you're eliminated. With 24 players available in every race – not to mention the Mario Kart tendency to hit you hardest when you're on top – Knockout Tour competitions are chaotic and stressful, but during my time playing the game, this mode served as the highlight.</p>

<p>Time Trials</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e7018dbf-3973-4acc-be52-07a4e60b5e61" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Time Trials</h4>

<p>During today's Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct, we also learned about the other modes players can participate in. In Time Trials, you can hone your skills to post the best time possible across the various courses without worrying about other racers getting in your way or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/every-new-item-and-trick-in-the-mario-kart-world-direct">hitting you with items</a>. If you go online, you can compete against Ghost data from across the globe. As with previous iterations of the mode, it appears as though players start with three Mushrooms, which must be used judiciously to score the best time.</p>

<p>VS Race</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="123488ba-4d11-4f06-8bd2-8afc0fe477a5" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>VS Race</h4>

<p>If you'd prefer real competition, you can enter into VS Race, which allows you to compete against a full field of 24 racers, including real humans and COM drivers. You can select the courses you want to race with the traditional three-lap format or even compete by racing between specific courses. The ruleset is also fully customizable; you can select what class you want to race in (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc), split the 24 drivers into up to four teams, select or restrict specific items, designate the COM driver difficulty, and choose how many races are in the series.</p>

<p>Battle Mode</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b250456e-160a-4f00-9860-ff4651469abb" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Battle Mode</h4>

<p>The franchise mainstay Battle Mode also makes its return in Mario Kart World. The Battle Mode present in Mario Kart World seems more in line with the series' traditional offering as seen in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, rather than the unpopular version found in the Wii U version of Mario Kart 8. Battle Mode can be played locally or online, with two modes announced: Balloon Battle and Coin Runners. Balloon Battle gives players a set number of balloons to represent their hit points. Each time you take damage, one of your balloons pops. You are eliminated from the match if all of your balloons are destroyed. Coin Runners first debuted in Mario Kart Wii, with the main objective of collecting as many coins as possible while preventing your opponents from collecting more than you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Free Roam</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b0010571-26cc-4693-b0fd-f6079fbfbb29" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Free Roam</h4>

<p>If you just want to explore Mario Kart World's vast region free from the fires of competition, you can do so in Free Roam. Here, you can run along the roads, go off-roading, or even speed down the rivers as you uncover every nook and cranny this open world has to offer. As you drive around, you can engage with various side objectives. One such objective presents itself in the form of P-Switches. Once you activate a P-Switch, a mission begins, requiring you to show off your skills. In the Direct, one objective involves jumping between multiple rails to collect blue coins, while another task involves reaching a goal while dodging incoming boulders within a set time limit. Nintendo claims there are hundreds of P-Switches across the world. You can also find collectibles such as hidden coins like the Peach Medallion shown in the Direct, hidden panels to activate, and more secrets. While in Free Roam, which can be done solo or with friends, you can access Photo Mode at any time.</p>

<p>Multiplayer</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8c281b99-2489-49c5-b719-57ee301f33dd" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><h4>Local and Online Play</h4>

<p>If you'd like to play with friends (or strangers), you can hop online to compete in the various modes on offer in the Mario Kart World package. Mario Kart World supports up to 4-player splitscreen, as well as local wireless for up to 8 players, with two players allowed on each individual Switch 2 system. Up to 24 players can compete online, with a maximum of 2 players on each system. While you're waiting for players to join and ready up, you are placed in a joint Free Roam session so that you can explore with the other players. By opening the map, you can see where the other players in the session are and teleport to them immediately for cooperative exploration. If you have the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/17/mario-kart-worlds-cameraplay-lets-you-broadcast-your-live-facial">use GameChat features</a> and even superimpose each player's face over their character so you can know who is playing as who at a moment's notice and see their reactions in real time.</p>

<p>Course List</p>

<p>Mario Kart World is poised to be the most ambitious Mario Kart game yet. However, the $80 price tag has stirred up sufficient controversy. Nintendo has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5d07f55a-1a29-495e-8613-f59f3047c54b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">justified the price tag</a> by saying it priced the game based on the value it brings to players, but many still decry the price as too much. Still, as the flagship launch title of the Nintendo Switch 2, it will likely sell well off the starting line, even with preorder details for the console still up in the air in the wake of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">ongoing tariff saga in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches alongside Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. For more on the new game in the beloved franchise, check out our hands-on preview of Mario Kart World <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e91306ba-da57-4a47-8e31-de54d59fabe4" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting">here</a>.</p>

<p>GameChat allows for in-game voice chat, allowing players to speak to each other during online races using the Switch 2’s built-in microphone. You can also watch each other's live game screens broadcast to the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that players can use GameChat without subscribing to Nintendo Switch Online until March 31, 2026. After that, a Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CameraPlay allows owners of the Switch 2 camera to capture live footage of their face, which appears in-game as a portrait over their driver. This allows players to see each other’s live reactions as they ruin each other's day in the many ways Mario Kart allows. If you’re playing four players locally, a single camera can capture everyone's faces in the room at once.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World launches on June 5 for Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">$79.99</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friend%E2%80%99s-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more.1167678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/lords-of-the-fallen-version-2-0-adds-free-friends-pass-shared-co-op-progression-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>CI Games has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> Version 2.0, a huge update to the game that brings improvements to combat, characters, adds shared progression in co-op, and also introduces a free Friend’s Pass scheme to the game.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone update, the game is at steep 67-72% discount through the PlayStation Spring Sale until 23rd April, until 24th April on Epic, and until 1st May on Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - VERSION 2.0 (Free Friend’s Pass, Shared Progression Co-op) | PC, PS5, Xbox X|S" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jQ3S2JzA9s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the free Friend’s Pass, you need to purchase just one copy of the game in order to play co-op, inviting any other person that you like to join, much like the same scheme for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction</a>. A special Friend’s Pass version of the game is now available across PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5, giving offline access to the tutorial and character creator, and also allowing for full crossplay co-op.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the shared progression in co-op now saves all main story progress for both players that start a new game together, so long as you’ve defeated a similar number of main bosses. Both players retain their loot, 100% vigor and can revive one another in an online session. The previous co-op progression style is also retained, if you prefer that.</p>

<p>Read more about the nitty-gritty of how this works in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLordsOfTheFallen/comments/1k1g6bk/lotf_v20_coop_faq/">FAQ on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>These are already pretty significant additions, but CI Games has continued to iterate on the gameplay since the last update, version 1.7, was released in December. Version 2.0 has revamped combat and movement with smoother animations, weapon response, lock-on, evasions and more. There’s now a dedicated jump button for improved platforming, too.</p>
<p>The character creator has been overhauled, leading into an improved tutorial, and there’s a modernised UI and HUD through the game as well.</p>
<p>“Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates” said Marek Tymninski, CEO of CI Games. “The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.”</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen underwhelmed upon its original release in 2023, despite having its intriguing twinned world mechanic and looking to be a more distinctive game than the 2014 title that it supplanted. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/12/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review/">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, Jason said, “I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</p>
<p>A sequel is in development, with an expected release in 2026, so it’s high time that CI Games wrap up the continued support of this title and put their full focus onto the next game.</p>

		<p>While we all look ahead to gorging ourselves on chocolate eggs in a few days time, the short week and extra long weekend will also give plenty time for playing more games than usual. That’s what the future holds, but what about the past? What have we all been playing the last seven days?</p>
<p>There’s been an awful lot of Blue Prince being played in my house, but not by me outside of when I helped with a light switching puzzle. Instead, I’ve made the smallest of starts on Xenoblade Chronicles 2, finally getting round to a game that I must have bought about 6 years ago now, and I’ve touched on a couple games for preview in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Dom’s been away all week on holiday, taking his Switch and 3DS along for company – no doubt hoping to snag a StreetPass visitor or two on his travels – though he’s not actually told me what, if anything, he’s managed to play. So I’m going to suggest that they’ve spent the whole week playing Mario Party games.</p>
<p>Aran has found himself managing Promise Mascot Agency, and as he nears the end of the story, he says that Pinky is likely to go down as the best supporting character of this year – something that Pinky and the Brain fans would certainly agree on.</p>

<p>Sticking with the A’s, Ade has played more Atomfall while he takes a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He’s had fun playing a spot of “Danger Cricket”, as I’m calling it, knocking away thrown grenades with his cricket bat, and generally having a lovely time in the Lake District. He’s also made a return to Helldivers 2.</p>

<p>Jim, meanwhile, has not taken a break from Assassin’s Creed Shadows, eliminating a few more targets from&nbsp;Yasuke and Naoe’s naughty lists – “I’m not particularly fond of the game’s ever-expanding objective board which seems to sprout new quests every time you look away, though it does give me plenty to do while travelling between story mission markers.”</p>
<p>Alongsdie that, his daughter is getting more interested in video games, so they’ve been playing My Friend Peppa Pig and Cars 3.</p>
<p>It’s been a bit of Hogwarts Legacy and Terraria for Gamoc, as he’s now wrapped up the main story of the former, while Miguel has been playing&nbsp; Fatal Fury City of the Wolves, a bunch of The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, and a little pinch of Blue Prince.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out this week with Steve:</p>
<p>“This week I have played through South of Midnight which I absolutely loved, and took your advice by downloading the soundtrack which has got plenty of repeat plays. I also continued my Sisyphean quest to 100% Lego Skywalker Saga which is ongoing (perhaps eternally). Got lost in Metroid Dread so waiting til I can play it docked for a clearer view of the map. Did manage to deflect one EMMI attack which made me feel like a boss until I got myself stuck in a dead end and was killed immediately after… Finally, I’ve played a couple of small indie games for review.”</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What have you played this week, and what do you have in store for the doubly long weekend?</p>

			<p>Polaris Quest, a Chinese development studio owned by Tencent, has published a new gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram, the game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks a bit too much like Guerrilla's Horizon franchise</a>. Truth be told, there are some gameplay differences. Whereas the Horizon games are action/adventure titles with some light RPG elements thrown in for good measure, Light of Motiram is mostly a survival game where players must establish a base and defend it. The building system will be based on a realistic physics engine.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a lot of emphasis on taming the over a hundred types of 'Mechanimals'. Each comes with unique skills and growth potential. Players can assign Mechanimals different combat modes and production traits. Combat itself also seems more centered on melee with dodging, blocking, and counterattacking moves. Moreover, Light of Motiram includes seamless cooperative multiplayer throughout the whole game, something that Horizon games have lacked so far - although Guerrilla Games is <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on Horizon Online</a>, a co-op game that is the Dutch studio's next big thing. Sure, it's hard to shake the visual similarities, which are definitely more than just inspirations.</p>

<p>Anyway, it won't be long before Light of Motiram becomes available for everyone to check out. Polaris Quest plans to launch it in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android as a free-to-play game. You can find the system requirements below.</p>

			<p>During the Galaxies Showcase, Anshar Studios and 3D Realms published a new trailer for the Painkiller reboot. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/painkiller-returns-in-fall-2025-reimagined-with-co-op-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late March at the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2024 for a release scheduled later this year.</p>
<p>In the new Painkiller game, players will use these seven weapons to slay all sorts of demons and foes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrodriver: Barrage enemies with rapid-firing shurikens that bounce off hard surfaces.</li>
<li>Stakegun: Hurls high-damage stakes that can impale foes from long-range.</li>
<li>SMG: Unleashes loads of ammo in short, rapid-fire bursts.</li>
<li>Handcannon: Decimate enemies from long range with deadly precision.</li>
<li>Shotgun: Spits destructive pellets at short range that can damage and stagger multiple foes.</li>
<li>Rocket Launcher: Discharges a rocket projectile with a devastating blast radius that can stagger even heavy enemies.</li>
<li>Painkiller: a versatile weapon with a brutal melee attack that hooks onto enemies, shreds them to pieces, and refills your ammo.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Weapons Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dUKtbucEOk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this reboot, players must choose between four playable characters: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. Each comes with unique perks and boosts to energy, health, power, or damage. Tarot cards can be used to enhance character abilities and even combined with those of other players. Indeed, the addition of cooperative multiplayer is arguably the greatest change compared to the original. We'll have to wait and see if the game can retain its signature gameplay even when playing with others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-fantasy-action-game-covenant-gets-new-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Showcase, independent developer Legion Studio shared the second official trailer for Covenant, an upcoming first-person dark fantasy action game. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at The Game Awards 2024, Covenant is being developed by a 12-person team with industry credits in big franchises like Call of Duty, DOOM, Apex Legends, Battlefield, Destiny, and Halo.</p>
<p>Players will step into the role of a warrior angel sent from the Heavens into Creation to follow in the steps of the fallen angel Malach. According to Legion, this mythical land is designed to be fully interconnected, just like in a Soulslike game. Because of this, puzzles, riddles, platforming, and exploration are going to be part of the player's journey. Discovering shortcuts and seeking out hidden paths will be the key to uncovering every secret.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is the core of the game. The developers said they have put a lot of emphasis on melee combat, which was inspired by fighting games (Tekken, Smash Bros), immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Dishonored), and action games (Dark Souls). There are even different stances that change the player character's entire fighting style, down to the way they run, jump, kick, and slide. Each of the stances drastically modifies the play style. Magic will also play a key role in complementing the build crafting, strategy, and creativity that players will be able to exhibit.</p>
<p>Covenant will support co-op multiplayer as well as competitive multiplayer in dedicated 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>

<p>The game is said to be still in early development. Legion said they'd like to avoid going into early access, but it may become necessary at some point if the studio needs financial help (they are currently seeking a publisher). They would also wish to port their game to consoles, but for now, they can only promise the PC version, which can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
