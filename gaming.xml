            <p>Tavern Keeper has been kicking around for a good number of years now, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-dev-tycoon">Game Dev Tycoon</a> developers Greenheart Games polished up their charming mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy bartending with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/theme-hospital">Theme Hospital</a>-style sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">management</a>. Almost a decade from Game Dev Tycoon‚Äôs release, Tavern Keeper is now finally approaching its early access release later this year.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper pops you in the beer-splashed boots of publican orcs, who as you‚Äôd imagine must juggle keeping locals happy with the business of running and expanding their enterprise. That includes laying out the tavern‚Äôs rooms themselves, filling them with furniture, ensuring that stock levels are kept up and hiring more staff - who you must also keep happy - to help you out with cooking meals (such as flamb√© swamp rat), cleaning and meeting the demands of patrons.</p>
<p>The game‚Äôs campaign throws up both some fun simulation-sandbox events - whether fires caused by errant fireplace ashes or an outbreak of the plague - and more crafted dialogue options with characters that help form its story. The simulation layer certainly seems to run deep, taking into account everything from the brightness of your torchlit cabin and filth levels to the unique environments and local cultures surrounding taverns in different locations. If you prefer to just decorate, there‚Äôll be a design mode too.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper is somewhat unbelievably only Greenheart Games‚Äô second game after Game Dev Tycoon, which came out way back in 2012 and won over folks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-game-dev-tycoon">including Nate</a> (RPS in Peace) for its charming and comical trip through the history of video game development.</p>

<p>Tavern Keeper looks to keep that same charm and lightheartedness at its core, going by the first gameplay trailer, which immediately had me dreaming up my ideal pub <a href="https://youtu.be/6tVIabRBKmY">like that episode of Peep Show</a>. (You can even christen your fantasy tavern, though I‚Äôd personally recommend not following the naming conventions of Super Hans.) If there‚Äôs higher praise than that, I can‚Äôt think of it.</p>
<p>Tavern Keeper will pull its first pints in Q4 this year, when it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/">throws open its doors on Steam early access</a>. See you at the bar.</p>

However, it hasn‚Äôt quite lived up to that since relaunching on May 28. </p><h2 id="h34060"><a id=""></a>Poor performance and laggy combat</h2><p>I hopped into <em>MultiVersus </em>last night, excited to check out the game‚Äôs new character, <em>Friday the 13th </em>killer Jason Voorhees. Playing on an Xbox Series X, I encountered frame dips and lag during the opening tutorial sequence featuring Shaggy and Batman. After that, I ran into lag while just using the game‚Äôs menus and had performance issues during AI fights. Online, I had two matches disconnect and had other matches slow down to a crawl due to a combination of lag and performance dips. It all felt bad! </p><p>Looking online, it seems I‚Äôm not alone. I‚Äôve found countless clips from players complaining about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ChrisHenares/status/1795782840551874837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poor performance on different platforms</a></span>.

During the game‚Äôs extended beta, the option to use any character in local play offered a fun way for folks to test out characters before buying them, and provided tournament organizers a way to let everyone have access to the full roster without having to fork over a ton of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1795629888109768821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MultiVersus </em>game director Tony Huynh suggested on Twitter</a></span> that the team was looking into this specific issue, but it‚Äôs still unclear if characters will be unlocked in local play in the future. </p><p>This isn‚Äôt the only negative change made to the full game after its open beta. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As documented on the <em>MultiVersus </em>subreddit</a></span>, a lot has changed in the full release of the online fighter, and most of it sounds like a big step back.</p><p>For example, leaderboards at the end of matches have been removed, there is no longer an advanced tutorial mode, cheaper characters have had their in-game prices raised, battle pass XP can only be earned from challenges and not from playing matches, and you can‚Äôt remove the red/blue team color effects on characters seen in 2 v 2 matches. Players are also unhappy with how much slower and clunkier the game feels compared to the beta. </p><p>The overall vibes online after the game‚Äôs first full day back seem mostly negative, though a lot of fans are hopeful that the developers can fix some of these problems and make gameplay feel more like it did during the extended beta in 2022. Hopefully, WB won‚Äôt have to kill the game for another 10 months or so to fix this stuff.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of our favorite video game franchises exist in a sad state of limbo. It‚Äôs only natural that after decades of companies making games and trying to earn the most money from them, that some good titles would fall through the cracks, never to become a big, annualized franchise like <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Madden</em>.<br></p><p>But what are some of those games that deserve another shot? We‚Äôve rounded up a handful of dead franchises we want to see spring back to life.</p></div></div><div><p>The maddening thing about the death of the <em>Sly Cooper </em>franchise is Sucker Punch‚Äôs PlayStation 2 platformer series was done at one point and we could have just left it alone and not ended up in this mess. The trilogy ended on a high note in 2005 with <em>Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves.</em> Then, Sanzaru Games, who worked on the PlayStation 3 remasters, pitched a fourth game to Sony all about traveling to the titular thief‚Äôs ancestors‚Äô times and pulling off heists across the timeline. <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em> was a solid new entry that managed to modernize the formula while staying true to its roots.. The problem was: It ended on a devastating cliffhanger. Sly was trapped in the timeline and has been stuck in Ancient Egypt ever since.</p><p>Sanzaru planned to wrap things up with a DLC set in Egypt, but Sony <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/sly-cooper-egypt-dlc-cancelled-give-me-sly-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to greenlight it</a></span>. Since then, there has been a planned film and TV series, neither of which got off the ground. Sucker Punch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-infamous-sly-cooper-sequel-release-date-1849135478">confirmed in 2022</a></span> that there were no plans to revive the series, so Sony damned one of its PS2 mascots to a life trapped in a different time. They‚Äôll <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467">slap him on promotional material</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gear.playstation.com/Product/1535734-Sly_Cooper_20th_Anniversary_Poster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throw a party for his 20th anniversary</a></span>, but won‚Äôt save him. Give me <em>Sly Cooper 5 </em>Sony. Or make an animated short or even just an official art piece of him escaping Ancient Egypt. Save him! ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, there was an arcade <em>Bionic Commando</em>, but let me be clear: The <em>Bionic Commando </em>everyone loved was the face-meltingly awesome NES game, the one in which you fire a bazooka right at Hitler‚Äôs face and watch it explode. (If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this classic moment in video game history, see the above video.) Violence like that may be fairly par for the course today, but in 1988, it was totally metal. This was a game that went all out. Adding to its sheer, unrelenting awesomeness were all the incredible tunes and, most of all, the thrilling movement of our titular hero. There are still few games that have ever felt so satisfying to control, as you master the timing of your swings to swoop through the air and infiltrate enemy strongholds like the elite soldier you are. Yes, it got a sequel of sorts with the 2009 game of the same name, but it just didn‚Äôt deliver on the same level or make the most of the signature grappling mechanic. Rather than a new big-budget 3D game, I‚Äôd love to see a fresh take on the classic side-scrolling (and side-swinging) action. Let some inventive, crackerjack indie studio take the reins and see what they can do with that delicious movement. If <em>Prince of Persia </em>can get a sweet new 2D game in 2024, then I think <em>Bionic Commando </em>can get one, too. ‚Äî <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Capcom‚Äôs <em>Onimusha </em>games carved out a distinct niche for themselves in the gaming landscape of the early 2000s. Superficially, they were reminiscent of the <em>Resident Evil </em>games with their pre-rendered backgrounds, fixed camera angles, and environmental puzzles, but they also fused sword-swinging samurai action with elements of demonic horror, giving them a vibe all their own. (At one point they even pulled French actor Jean ‚Äú<em>The Professional</em>‚Äù Reno <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/o-aAPg_Ajjk?si=EtBxIb6mGazhKpGa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into the proceedings</a></span>, and I gotta say, I respect the sheer audacity.) With the recent success of the TV miniseries <em>Shog≈´n </em>and more high-profile games than ever before being set in the era of samurai, I think the time is ripe for a new <em>Onimusha </em>game as well. Give us a tightly focused 8-10 hour game along the lines of Capcom‚Äôs recent <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes that lets us slash demons and vanquish evil without going the route of colossal open-world adventures like <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>or the forthcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em>. </em>‚Äî <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Watching that intro movie above still gets me pumped for this moody 1998 role-playing game which<em> </em>showed that developer Square was willing to take big swings and depart from the norm with a modern-day, real-world setting and unconventional combat. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is great for many reasons, not least because of its outstanding use of New York City. Yes, absolutely bananas stuff happens in the game, and at least one key character crosses the line into stereotypical caricature at times, but New York itself feels authentic and layered here, as your journey takes you from high-society operas to museums to streets where the downtrodden reside. Protagonist Aya Brea‚Äôs quest is both thrilling and haunting, with explosive moments right out of an action movie and others that suggest low-budget body horror, all playing out in a near-empty city in that strange, liminal time between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs.</p><p><em>Parasite Eve </em>got a few follow-ups but neither was as original or memorable as the first. I‚Äôd love to see Square Enix bring the series back today and try to create something that matches the desolate, moody tone of the 1998 classic, while also doing something fresh and original with the combat to create a greater fusion of role-playing and survival horror action. ‚Äî <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div><div><p>Full disclosure: I really liked <em>L.A. Noire</em>, but I‚Äôm also someone who has a weakness for the style and atmosphere of the period, and for stories of hard-boiled detectives operating within the all-consuming corruption of the L.A.P.D. (<em>L.A. Confidential </em>is one of my favorite films of all time.) I recognize that there were things about this game that felt unsatisfying to many players, and that‚Äôs a big part of why I think the concept of a detective game set in 1940s L.A. deserves another chance. There‚Äôs still so much potential in it! I think there must be tons of people out there who would love to play a great noir crime saga that sees you investigating murders, chatting up dames in smoky jazz clubs, and finding yourself in way over your head as the trail of evidence leads you to run up against some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the city. Let‚Äôs give it another shot, with clearer, more refined interrogation mechanics and character models that don‚Äôt inhabit the uncanny valley quite so blatantly. ‚Äî <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Look, I take no pleasure in writing about <em>Titanfall</em> here in this list of d e a d franchises. But ya‚Äôll, we‚Äôre nearing 10 years since <em>Titanfall 2</em> came out and, you know, sometimes ya just gotta accept that something you really want in life just ain‚Äôt gonna happen for you.</p><p>I get it, in a world of repetitive, mindless shooters, <em>Titanfall</em> was (and is) something special. On paper, it could‚Äôve easily been Just-Another-Shooter‚Ñ¢ stock with gimmicks to try and stay unique, but its wall-running and titular Titans worked exceedingly well. The guns felt good to shoot and reload, and the extra jump kit abilities allowed for unique traversal and combat scenarios rarely seen elsewhere. Add in the Titans, and <em>Titanfall</em> skirmishes were dynamic and explosive. True, some of that still lives on in developer Respawn‚Äôs <em>Apex Legends</em>, but you and I both know that‚Äôs no substitute (though you should give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-can-t-stop-playing-this-titanfall-f-e-a-r-killzone-d-1850772277">indie title <em>Sprawl</em></a></span>, easily one of my favorite games of 2023, a shot as it contains some engaging wall-running action and so much more).</p><p>It would be wonderful to see another <em>Titanfall</em>, complete with a great single-player experience that takes everything learned from the first and second games, and <em>Apex Legends</em>, and delivers an energetic, gravity defying shooter punctuated by epic and engaging gameplay with mechs. ‚Äî <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>NanaOn-Sha‚Äôs rhythm game about a rapping dog may not be the most complex take on the genre, but the <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>series is still incredibly distinct. Parappa is a regular teenager dealing with regular teenage problems, but he gets through them by rapping alongside different teachers. A dog rapping alongside a sentient onion as he learns karate or taking his driver‚Äôs test with a moose shouldn‚Äôt work, but <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>pulls off each of these scenarios with style, an incredible soundtrack, and a deceptively simple rhythm game with hidden perks for improvising. The sequel doesn‚Äôt have as many bops, but the jump to the PlayStation 2 let the team flex and create cooler music videos to accompany each song.</p><p>It‚Äôs all very silly, and even though there hasn‚Äôt been a new game in over 20 years, the main character and his silly little songs have persisted over the decades through merchandise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/step-on-the-gas-meme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and memes</a></span>. A <em>Parappa the Rapper 3 </em>makes perfect sense as something Sony could drop on PlayStation Network for relatively cheap. This is the exact kind of project that digital storefronts are made for. ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div><div><p>One of the all-time best feelings I‚Äôve felt in any game I‚Äôve ever played is free-falling in <em>Gravity Rush</em>. The series‚Äô protagonist Kat is one of the most gorgeously drawn and animated characters I‚Äôve ever seen, and she is never more expressive than when she is dropping from the sky. <em>Gravity Rush</em>‚Äôs camera swings anywhere you want it to go, allowing you to frame Kat‚Äôs free fall however you please. You can follow her from afar, ascribe to cinematography‚Äôs rule-of-thirds and frame her dramatically, or stick the camera comically close to her. Kat‚Äôs hair and clothes catch in the wind, which rushes past her as she twirls through the air and spreads her arms with reckless abandon. She‚Äôs like a little kid realizing that she can fly for the first time.<br></p><p><em>Gravity Rush </em>had a lot going for it, like its gravity-defying combat, its beautifully drawn world which lifted design elements from classical French architecture, and its charming cast of characters, but its biggest draw is that it‚Äôs simply <em>the </em>most liberating game. Tons of games allow me to do far more than <em>Gravity Rush</em>, but few of them have ever matched the high of being suspended above a town and then just letting it go. There‚Äôs something intoxicating and empowering about Kat‚Äôs ability to reduce the world to a blur around her as she zips past it all. It‚Äôs just best-in-class movement, and it‚Äôs criminal that Japan Studio and Team Gravity aren‚Äôt around to give us more astounding worlds to float around in. ‚Äî <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>Putting Banjo and Kazooie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-smash-ultimate-1835415834">in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a></span> was a no-brainer, but I‚Äôm always wary of companies cashing in on a beloved franchise with zero commitment. It‚Äôs been 16 years since the last <em>Banjo-Kazooie </em>game, and even that wasn‚Äôt the platformer fans have been asking for since <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> in 2000. The company is busy with <em>Sea of Thieves </em>these days, but if Microsoft has enough money to acquire a bunch of studios then promptly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">gut them</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685">shut them down</a></span>, it could instead nurture the IP and talent it already has. ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Speaking of Rare, <em>Viva Pi√±ata</em> is a perfect video game. You‚Äôre telling me a garden simulator in which you build a home for living pi√±atas that reproduce by dancing doesn‚Äôt sound like the tightest shit you‚Äôve ever played? Then maybe you should boot up the <em>Rare Replay</em> collection and see for yourself. <em>Viva Pi√±ata</em> should have been huge. The games were great (well, with the exception of the <em>Party Animals </em>mini-game compilation) and Microsoft made it a multimedia franchise, so we got a pretty funny television show out of the deal that lasted a few years. But we tragically haven‚Äôt seen anything out of the series since 2008‚Äôs <em>Trouble in Paradise </em>and <em>Pocket Paradise</em> launched on the Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS, respectively. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt imagine a version of <em>Viva Pi√±ata </em>on modern platforms that doesn‚Äôt succumb to some insufferable live-service bullshit like microtransactions to buy in-game supplies or your character becoming ‚Äútired‚Äù if you don‚Äôt pay for an extension that day. But I can dream of another trip to Pi√±ata Island in 4K. ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>How do we live in a timeline with hyper advanced ray-tracing graphics technology and no new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game? For that matter, how is that the case and we don‚Äôt have a major AAA stealth title that takes advantage of this tech? Or just one that exists period? (Sorry, I don‚Äôt count <em>Hitman</em>. Cry about it).</p><p>What little I had of a happy childhood was often spent between <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>and <em>Splinter Cell</em>. I came to <em>MGS</em> for the great gameplay and mind-bending story. But <em>Splinter Cell</em> was the more sophisticated stealth experience that got better with each game (until around <em>Double Agent</em> where things got kinda meh). Light, sound, precision movement through hostile territory, and, of course, impressive graphics that weren‚Äôt just flashy ways to show off your hardware, but were actually dynamic parts of the stealth action.</p><p>Gaming tech has only gotten more sophisticated since the last <em>Splinter Cell </em>games. I usually don‚Äôt beg for bleeding edge tech, but a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> (which apparently, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-remake-concept-art-sam-fisher-free-game-1849798206">maybe, might, sorta happen</a></span>‚Äîand god help Ubisoft if Michael Ironside isn‚Äôt voicing Sam again), would have me salivating over how advanced lighting and rendering techniques could make the game look and feel amazing to play. ‚Äî <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>The first <em>Killzone </em>came along when I was far too young to reasonably play it, but the second struck at just the right time. Touted as PlayStation‚Äôs next big thing, the visually sumptuous shooter represented the very cutting edge of technology, and I took that bait <em>hard</em>. <em>Killzone 2 </em>was the game that taught me about the importance of visual fidelity and it just so happened to be an incredibly weighty and hardcore multiplayer FPS as well. I was forged in the insanity of <em>Resistance</em>‚Äôs all-out wars and <em>Killzone‚Äôs </em>tight-knit and punchy encounters.<br></p><p><em>Killzone </em>was probably ultimately brought down by its ridiculously high production values, but some of the stuff in that game is still top tier all these years later. The brutal melee executions of <em>Killzone 3 </em>instilled a love of animation in my friends and I that we still haven‚Äôt shaken. I can still recall the satisfying pound of the shotgun in <em>Killzone 2, </em>and the brain-tickling tick that confirmed a kill in it and <em>Killzone: Mercenary</em>. Speaking of, <em>Mercenary </em>is one of the finest adaptations of a series to a handheld platform that I‚Äôve ever played, and a criminally overlooked game in that series and on the PS Vita.</p><p>I‚Äôm the first person to often bemoan something that feels overproduced, but if I may be self-indulgent, I‚Äôd love to see another shot at <em>Killzone </em>sometime in the future. ‚Äî <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>My first <em>Deus Ex</em> was its first sequel: <em>Invisible War</em>. It‚Äôs an entry that‚Äôs not terribly popular with enthusiasts of the original game, but it remains a competent immersive sim that likely was my personal introduction to the genre and franchise.<br></p><p>I would eventually go on to play the original (though not to completion, which I really ought to do something about) and came to understand why it was so memorable. Its thick atmosphere of enigmatic conspiracy theories and gripping, unpredictable gameplay of interlocking systems‚Äîfinding keys and codes for rooms, staying out of sight of enemy patrols‚Äîwas a perpetual motion machine of espionage and high-concept science fiction themes that I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of.</p><p>But while Adam Jensen‚Äôs pair of imsim adventures were solid, they felt like they were leading to an eventual third release that‚Äôd combine the best of <em>Human Revolution </em>and <em>Mankind Divided</em> into an excellent, moody cyberpunk-esque adventure to save the world. Sadly, that‚Äôs unlikely to happen. Sure, there was a solid eight-year gap between <em>Invisible War</em> and <em>Human Revolution</em>, and we‚Äôre right around eight years since the last game, <em>Mankind Divided</em>. But tumultuous brand management seems destined to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">keep us from another <em>Deus Ex</em> title</a></span> for some time yet. Perhaps forever.</p><p>It‚Äôs a shame because there‚Äôs just nothing like <em>Deus Ex</em> and the world is starved of great immersive sim titles. ‚Äî <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>My friends used to make fun of me because I liked <em>Red Faction</em>. I don‚Äôt know why. But I do know that their distaste of this futuristic, working-class revolution-themed shooter franchise was their loss. To be fair, my memories of the earlier days of this franchise are a little fuzzy as I get on in years, but the more recent <em>Red Faction: Guerilla</em> remains a satisfying game to play. Sure, it falls victim to the condition of having a large open world that is a little too empty, but the destructive physics systems which detail intricate and satisfying collapses of buildings and objects never gets old.</p><p>And hey, with a game that is about literally <em>smashing</em> the status quo to build a better future, there‚Äôs a narrative cohesion between the game‚Äôs systems that makes the whole experience just more entertaining and immersive. It‚Äôs also been 15 years since <em>Guerilla</em>‚Äôs release date (it was re-Mars-tered six years ago), and 13 years since it‚Äôs so-so follow-up <em>Armageddon</em>, so it‚Äôs safe to say this one‚Äôs probably gonna continue sleeping for the unforeseeable future. Which, like many other dead franchises, is a shame given how computing power has grown since <em>Guerilla</em> arrived on PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 release a decade-and-a-half ago. I mean, look at stuff like <em>Teardown</em>!</p><p>Our gaming machines are so much more powerful these days and I long for more wildly destructive physics simulations while uniting the Martian working class. ‚Äî <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Hello, it‚Äôs me, your resident PlayStation FPS freak. At the outset of the PS3 era, Sony had two major franchises fostering entirely unique shooter experiences. One of them was viscerally realistic and grim <em>Killzone</em>, and the other was my beloved off-kilter <em>Resistance</em>. I didn‚Äôt play the original, but one of my older cousins had picked up the second title on PS3. If you ask most folks my age, the formative FPS title of their youth is probably a <em>Call of Duty </em>title, specifically <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. While I‚Äôve certainly got room in my heart for that legendary game, my love for the genre is entirely predicated on <em>Resistance 2</em> and the sleepless nights me and my cousin spent duking it out in its massive 60-player Skirmish matches with one of the greatest armories of any FPS title.<br></p><p><em>Resistance </em>was simply everything to me. It was massive and it was weird as hell. In the brief time that we had with the series, it ran the gamut of tones. The bookends of the trilogy were bleak post-apocalyptic shooters (<em>Resistance 3 </em>is particularly great), but the middle installment was cartoonish and all over the place. Nathan Hale and Joseph Capelli, the trilogy‚Äôs protagonists, could not be a greater representation of the series‚Äô unique schisms across entries. <em>Resistance</em> was, above all else, fun as hell though, and it‚Äôs where I got my sea legs. <em>Resistance</em>‚Äôs weaponry, which took inspiration from Insomniac‚Äôs main series, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, also remains burned into my brain. The Augur remains one of my favorite weapons in any game and I learned trigger discipline while carefully placing tags on enemies and shooting them from around corners with the Bullseye.</p><p>Letting the series go has been one of the hardest pills to swallow over the last decade, especially because <em>Resistance 3 </em>really felt like it finally settled on a tone and formula that worked. Sure, it also brought the story to a pretty natural close, but there were enough interesting threads, especially as far as the origins of the invading alien species known as the Chimera, to expand upon the series and turn it into a pulpy sci-fi saga. I miss you all the time, <em>Resistance</em>. ‚Äî <strong>Moises Taveras</strong></p></div><div><p>In the ‚Äò90s, I didn‚Äôt play <em>Syphon Filter</em> nearly as much as I played another sneaky, espionage title: <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>. And you know, for good reason. <em>MGS</em> was just more on my wavelength, but I enjoyed cheering <em>Syphon Filter</em> on from the sides. It didn‚Äôt seem to have the narrative-heavy experience I craved, and wasn‚Äôt as sneaky, but to me that always made me more curious about it.</p><p>It‚Äôs been some years since I gave the first <em>Syphon Filter</em> a try, and I‚Äôm feeling a return to it is necessary for me. But I‚Äôm also kinda bummed that the franchise doesn‚Äôt exist prominently in Sony‚Äôs catalog. As has been exhibited with <em>Resistance</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em>, PlayStation has been home to off-beat shooters that I wish the company would maintain a presence in instead of just prestige AAA titles of the kind they mostly invest their money in.</p><p>And in a world without an active <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and whilst <em>MGS</em> still wrestles with its post-Kojima identity crisis, what an opportunity for <em>Syphon Filter</em> to make a return with excellent espionage action, tense shootouts, world-ending consequences, and insurmountable odds that you‚Äôre expected to sneak, shoot, and survive your way through.</p><p>Gabe, I never got to know ya like Snake and Sam, but damn if right now isn‚Äôt a perfect time for a new espionage thriller from this classic franchise, I don‚Äôt know when is. ‚Äî <strong>Claire Jackson</strong></p></div><div><p>Looking back on <em>Viewtiful Joe</em>, Capcom‚Äôs short-lived side-scrolling beat-em-up, I was surprised at just how quickly the series came and went. The first game in 2003 was part of the ‚ÄúCapcom Five,‚Äù a five-game initiative from the company to bring original games to the GameCube (it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise-betrayal-5806800">a whole drama back in the day</a></span>). The sequel solidified <em>Viewtiful Joe </em>as a series the next year, but the spin-offs that followed in 2005 failed to set the world on fire. In the years since, creator Hideki Kamiya (who went on to co-found <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames) has said he would like to return to the franchise, whether that be with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-wants-viewtiful-joe-dmc-remake-dante-x-bayonneta-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake of the first game</a></span> or with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/hideki_kamiya_would_love_to_release_viewtiful_joe_3_and_finish_that_trilogy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third entry</a></span>. For now, we‚Äôll just have to be content with the title character being playable in <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>‚Ä¶oh wait, they took him out in <em>Infinite</em>. ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong><br></p></div><div><p>For a time during the PS2 era, the <em>SSX </em>games offered up awesome extreme sports action, letting you do sick snowboarding tricks while listening to ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Tricky‚Äù by Run-D.M.C. It‚Äôs been over a decade since EA tried to bring the franchise back with the more realistic and well-reviewed <em>SSX </em>for Xbox 360 and PS3. Even though that last entry sold well, it seems EA isn‚Äôt convinced the world wants zany snowboarding action anymore. What a shame.</p><p>While I‚Äôm not sure a big AAA <em>SSX </em>game would sell in 2024 or is the right move, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the direction the franchise should take. Instead, look to <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em> and its recent remake of the first two games as inspiration. I bet there are a few studios out there that would be willing to remaster or remake the first three games into one rad package for modern consoles. Or just make a new <em>SSX </em>that is free-to-play and borrows its economy from <em>Fortnite</em>. I don‚Äôt know, just bring it back in some form EA. Let me do a sick 2160 off a snowy cliff again as Eddie. ‚Äî <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Some franchises on this list feel like they were never given a chance to become something big and successful. Then you have a series like Capcom‚Äôs <em>Dead Rising</em>, which feels like it‚Äôs been given a few chances and yet has exploded in the way you‚Äôd think a game about killing thousands of zombies would have. I think the problem isn‚Äôt just zombie fatigue, but that <em>Dead Rising</em> as a franchise is extremely inconsistent. Beyond the crowds of zombies and the ability to kill them all using anything you find, the games have changed a lot and that‚Äôs made it hard to develop a fanbase.</p><p>If I were to give Capcom some advice, it would be to look back at that first game and try again. But this time, embrace the harder and less flexible format of<em> Dead Rising 1</em>. People love that shit nowadays. Games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 </em>show that players crave challenges and difficulty in a way that maybe they didn‚Äôt back in the early days of the 360. And leverage the newer consoles to make the biggest zombie game yet, too. Imagine an open-world zombie game 10x bigger than any previous <em>Dead Rising</em>, but as hard and unforgiving as <em>Dark Souls</em>. That shit would sell like hotcakes! ‚Äî <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Sure, <em>technically </em>Valve has sort of (kind of) continued to update <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, sometimes with the help of fans, but I still consider this franchise dead, like most other Valve franchises. Which is sad, because <em>Left 4 Dead</em> ruled.</p><p>Valve did what Valve does best, and crafted two online co-op shooters that were perfect to play. Shooting down hordes of zombies with friends or hunting down other players as a special infected was a blast. Even if you played online without a mic, Valve built <em>L4D1 </em>and its sequel in a way that made it totally possible to play without talking. (Though chatting did help!) It also crafted characters, like Zoey and Ellis, that people cared about. I still think about Bill sacrificing himself in the final <em>L4D1 </em>DLC to this day. Hopefully, someone else at Valve is also thinking about <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. I hope so, because this franchise and its fans deserve a third entry. ‚Äî <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div><div><p>Okay, hold on. Come back. What if I told you Sony‚Äôs attempt at a <em>Smash Bros. </em>crossover fighter ruled, actually? Yes, it didn‚Äôt take off the way Nintendo‚Äôs brawler has, but it had some cool ideas, and in between the characters clearly added to advertise an upcoming project, the roster is pretty fucking solid. But even if you think <em>PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale </em>was a garbage copycat, we‚Äôre not here to retread the mistakes of the past. We‚Äôre envisioning a better future.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>launched on PS3 and Vita, Sony has gathered a lot of new, much-loved characters like Astro, Ellie, and Aloy to add to the roster, and has more cultural cache than they did during the PS3 generation to negotiate better guest characters. What if we got actual Dante instead of the <em>DmC: Devil May Cry </em>one because Capcom was clearly trying to make the game an ad for its upcoming game? Sony could secure egregious omissions like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro to properly represent the PlayStation brand‚Äôs history. I just want them to get a second chance to do it right, and PlayStation‚Äôs certainly in a better place to do that now than they were when the PlayStation 3 was in last place. ‚Äî <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was a few days ago that news surfaced regarding a potential Fallout x Call of Duty crossover bundle. Given the recent success of the Fallout TV show and the ongoing effort by Activision Blizzard‚Äôs studios to collaborate with every brand in the pop culture market, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before it surfaced for real.</p>



<p>Dataminers recently leaked an image online showing the ‚ÄòFallout Vault Dweller Tracker Pack‚Äô. This pack looks as though it‚Äôll contain a blueprint for the M4 and M16, and ‚ÄòVault Suit‚Äô skins for Gaz, Soap, Price, and Ghost.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apocalyptic-w-or-l">Apocalyptic W or L?</h2>



<p>Many were expecting something a little more substantial from this crossover, given how overwhelmingly successful the Fallout TV show has been since it was released on April 9. For instance, there‚Äôs an upcoming Fallout collaboration in Fortnite that‚Äôs already looking infinitely better than this leaked COD crossover.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795854134223970702/photo/1">the leaked art</a> that was found by dataminers, Modern Warfare‚Äôs core squad ‚Äì Ghost, Soap, Price, and Gaz ‚Äì have donned iconic Vault Suits modelled on those found in the new TV show. They‚Äôve also got some Vault-Tec branded weapons ‚Äì but that seems to be the full extent of the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack. It‚Äôs a safe assumption that there will also be the usual charms, emblems, and player cards associated with bundles, and the tracer pack element will most likely replicate the laser-focused weapons commonly found across the Fallout universe.</p>



<p>Will you be investing in the Fallout Vault Dweller Tracer Pack in Call of Duty?</p>

<p>Sony has taken down an interview with Naughty Dog Studio Head Neil Druckmann (<em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>) that the company now says contains "several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values." The surprising move comes after Druckmann took the extreme measure of publicly questioning a portion of the PR interview by <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">posting a lengthy transcript</a> that conflicted with the heavily edited version Sony posted online.</p>
<p>The odd media saga began last Thursday, when Sony published the interview (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525155202/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">archive here</a>) under the heading "The Evolution of Storytelling Across Mediums." The piece was part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/">the Creative Entertainment Vision section</a> of Sony's corporate site, a PR-driven concept exploring how Sony will "seamlessly connect multi-layered worlds where physical and virtual realities overlap to deliver limitless Kanto‚Äîthrough creativity and technology‚Äîworking with creators." Whatever that means.</p>
<p>Druckmann's short interview started <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">attracting</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created">attention</a> almost immediately, primarily due to Druckmann's apparent promotion of using AI tools in game development. Such tools "will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," Druckmann is quoted as saying. "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address."</p>
<h2>Not so fast...</h2>
<p>By Friday, though, Druckmann ended a months-long drought of social media posting by <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187392183898408">noting</a> that, in at least one case, the words posted by Sony were "not quite what I said. In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost."</p>
<p>As evidence, Druckmann posted this "rambling" 457-word response to a question about a "personal vision or dream project" he hoped to create:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I've been very lucky, in that I've already had that. I got the chance to make several of my dream projects. I am working on a new one right now. And it's maybe the most excited I've been for a project yet. I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me.</p>
<p>And I guess in general, there is something happening now that I think is very cool. Which is there's a new appreciation for gaming that I've never seen before. Like when I was growing up, gaming was more of a kid's thing. Now it's clearly for everyone. But it's like, if you're a gamer, you know about the potential of games, and non-gamers, they don't really know what they're missing out on.</p>
<p>But my hope was, when we made <em>The Last of Us</em> as a TV show that we could change that. And why I became so involved with it. I wanted so badly for it to be good, because I wanted this to happen, which is like someone who will watch the show and really like it. And fall in love with those characters the way that we have fallen in love with those characters and their story. And then realize at the end, "Wait, that's based on a video game?" and then go and check out the game and just see the wealth of narratives and everything that's happening in games.</p>
<p>So now I feel like there's kind of a spotlight on gaming. And you know, <em>Fallout</em> just came out. And that's a big success for Amazon. And I find that really exciting. Not because games need to be movies, or they need to be TV shows, but I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren't aware of the kind of experiences that exist in games. I think right now we've hit a tipping point where it's about to take off where people realize, "Oh my God, there's all these incredible moving experiences in games!"</p>
<p>So, I'm not only excited for this game that we're making‚Äîand it's, it's something really fresh for us‚Äîbut I'm also excited to see how the world reacts to it. Because of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I'm very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be‚Äîand l've already said too much about it. I'll stop there. So, you're asking me for my dream projects. I've been very lucky to have worked on my favorite games with incredible collaborators and I'm very thankful for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>For reference, here is the 127-word summary of that answer posted by Sony:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>I've been lucky to work on several dream projects and am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet. There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up. This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with <em>The Last of Us</em>, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the gist of Druckmann's original answer is more or less preserved, the condensed version loses a lot of the specific details and flavor Druckmann highlighted in his answer. The edited version also inserts some key phrases and ideas that Druckmann didn't use at all, such as his supposed hope that his new project "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>
<p>Though we don't know how much Druckmann's other answers were clipped or amended in the editing process, Druckmann's public annoyance with the edits was apparently enough to get Sony's attention. Sometime after Tuesday night, the PlayStation-maker <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">replaced the public interview</a> with the following message:</p>
<blockquote><p>In re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>Journalists often edit interview responses for concision and clarity, but this interview skips the usual step of noting the existence of those kinds of edits near the top of the piece. And while press releases often contain executive quotes that have been carefully crafted in consultation with PR professionals, there was no indication in this article that the responses here were anything other than Druckmann's own thoughts and words.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Game publishers and console makers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/11/a-look-at-first-party-bloggers-who-connect-devs-and-gamers/">a long history</a> of sharing developer interviews directly with the public rather than having those developers' views filtered through the press. This is the first instance we can remember where the promotional process itself has become a source of controversy.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-mp5a2-loadout-in-xdefiant.884130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mp5a2-loadout-in-xdefiant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mp5a2-loadout-in-xdefiant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Of the five SMGs currently in <em>XDefiant</em>, the MP5A2 is the least exciting on paper when you look underneath the hood and stack it against other options. However, something must be said about a well-balanced weapon that is easy to use. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Time-to-kill speed is not a strength of the MP5A2. According to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/weapon_builder/xd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the Vector, MP7, and P90 kill faster than the MP5A2 from most ranges, and it‚Äôs not particularly close in short-range engagements. Thankfully, a class-leading ADS time and impressive sprint-to-fire time make up for that shortcoming. In addition, the versatile SMG performs better than other weapons in the class in longer-ranged gun fights thanks to an incredibly easy-to-control recoil pattern. </p>
 <p data-characters="121" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false">Don‚Äôt let the stats fool you because this SMG performs surprisingly well in action and shines in multiple areas. </p> <h2 id="h-best-mp5a2-loadout-and-class-setup" data-injectable="false">Best MP5A2 loadout and class setup </h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3385-2.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;839&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Muzzle Booster</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Chrome-lined </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Superlight </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Folded </li> </ul> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">First and foremost, the MP5A2 has the second slowest reload time among SMGs in <em>XDefiant</em>, so it‚Äôs essential to equip the fast mag to improve reload times. Losing vertical and horizontal recoil is never ideal, but the muzzle booster is an excellent attachment for any weapon as it improves bullet velocity. The rest of the attachments on this loadout focus on improving mobility to better compete with other meta SMGs. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> faction for MP5A2</h2> <p data-characters="601" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="false">There might be better options, but Echelon is the most fun faction to have while using the MP5A2. The Low Profile Passive Trait hides you on the mini-map even if you fire your weapon unsuppressed, which is perfect for MP5A2 flank routes. Additionally, the Digital Ghillie Suit makes you invisible while you attempt to get behind and closer to enemy lines. Players can also choose to equip the Intel Suit instead, if they want to temporarily reveal the location of enemies. Finally, the Sonar Goggles Ultra ability reveals every enemy on the map and gives you a pistol that annihilates the competition.</p>

To unlock these gifts, Operators will need to tackle a variety of challenges, from Contracts to the explosive Champion‚Äôs Quest. Here are all the <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> rewards and the challenges needed to get them.</p> <h2 id="h-all-season-4-call-of-duty-warzone-rewards-and-challenges" data-injectable="false">All Season 4 Call of Duty: Warzone rewards and challenges</h2> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-season-4-early-patch-notes-unlimited-tac-sprint-boots-rebirth-island-ranked-resurgence-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> <em>Warzone </em>Rewards section showcases five categories: Economics, Contracts, Social, Mode, and Champion‚Äôs Quest. Each section caters to a specific element in the game, like how Social mandates you to interact with other players. The Champion‚Äôs Quest may be the most challenging, requiring Operators to win 30 games in total within the season. Now that we‚Äôve covered the basis of it, let‚Äôs check out all <em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em>challenges and rewards.</p>
 <h3 id="h-economics" data-injectable="false">Economics</h3> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Challenges</th><th>Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Loot Supply Crates</td><td>Treasure Hoarder Emblem</td></tr><tr><td>Loot Legendary Supply Crates</td><td>Mythical Crate Calling Card</td></tr><tr><td>Spend Cash in Battle Royale or Resurgence</td><td>Fortune Fatality Weapon Sticker</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase items from three different Buy Stations in a single Battle Royale or Resurgence match</td><td>Gilded Genetics Weapon Camo</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

        <p>Sony said they were testing compatibility for ‚Äúaccessing additional games on PC‚Äù earlier this year</p>

            <p>A PC adapter for Sony‚Äôs PlayStation VR2 has recently popped up in South Korea, giving a new update - albeit an unofficial one - on the incoming PC support for the PS5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/vr">VR</a> headset teased earlier this year.</p>
<!--more-->

</div>
<p>Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-officially-working-on-pc-game-support-for-the-ps-vr2-headset">announced in February</a> that they were looking into bringing PS VR2 to PC, marking a move away from the hardware‚Äôs current exclusivity to the PlayStation 5 console. While you can technically plug a PS VR2 into your computer as-is, of course, and Windows will even recognise it, it won‚Äôt work beyond simply becoming a head-mounted monitor - with definitely no controller support.</p>
<p>At the time, Sony indicated that the planned compatibility would work with PlayStation‚Äôs own VR-friendly titles on PC, with the wording vague enough to imply that it might also support other PC VR games, saying they were ‚Äútesting the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5‚Äù. The extremely brief blog post added that the plan was to launch PC support later in 2024.</p>
<p>It seems that PS VR2 support this year still seems to be on track, as certification for a PlayStation VR 2 PC Adapter was <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">recently granted</a> by South Korea‚Äôs national radio/wireless regulatory body, as spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certified-regulator/">UploadVR</a>. As you‚Äôd expect, the adapter appears to indicate a fairly simple solution to making the VR2 work on PC, forming a direct link between the existing cables and your computer rather than compatibility via wireless streaming or similar.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Sony-PS-VR2.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>As James noted back in February, the PS VR2 isn‚Äôt the cheapest headset on the block (though it‚Äôs a bit cheaper now it‚Äôs been out for a couple of years), but it‚Äôs very good value for the hardware on offer - including OLED display panels, built-in tracking and bundled controllers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, even if Sony don‚Äôt technically open up the hardware to supporting games beyond PlayStation titles, no doubt some enterprising developer will find a way in time once the hardware itself is compatible, potentially giving it a proper entry in the race for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-headset">best VR headsets</a> on PC. That might not be such a long wait, from the sounds of it.</p>

			<p>As we revealed in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-spin-2k25-qa-hangar-13-unveils-the-feature-set-of-the-long-awaited-tennis-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive interview</a> with developer Hangar 13, Top Spin 2K25 did not launch with any option to play against friends, being limited to random matchmaking only.</p>
<p>That changes with <a href="https://x.com/topspin2k/status/1795844853768868269" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's update</a>, a download of around 440.5 MB on Steam. Hangar 13 have added the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A social menu used to manage your 2K friends and platform friends</li>
<li>An entire social system which will let you invite your 2K friends and platform friends to online private matches</li>
<li>The Vivox Voice Chat System, which allows communication in online matches</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add friends from other platforms, but you will need to add their 2K Name, not the name they use on their platform directly. There are two easy ways to find your 2K Name, which you'll share with your Cross Play friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.2k.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2K Account on the web</a>, you can see your Display Name on the Account Details tab</li>
<li>In TopSpin 2K25, you can find it in Main Menu &gt; Settings &gt; 2K Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the game still lacks any options to play doubles online, which is a shame (as noted in my impressions piece), given that the original Top Spin already allowed that when it launched in 2003 for the original Xbox. Hangar 13's Game Director Remi Ercolani told Wccftech that the developers were hoping to offer more options after launch; let's hope a future patch adds this much-awaited feature to Top Spin 2K25.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you're playing the game, you can use the locker code CLAYSEASON to unlock 5 100% XP Boosts and a Lacoste Men's Tennis Polo.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-favorite-anime-mercedes-varnado%E2%80%99s-journey-from-sailor-moon-to-my-hero-academia.884103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/5/29/24159189/my-favorite-anime-mercedes-varnados-sailor-moon-my-hero-academia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="n1Rz4M">It‚Äôs no secret that Mercedes Varnado is a huge anime fan. The AEW wrestler-turned-actress has never been shy when it comes to sharing her love of Japanese animation, from appearing at the 2022 Royal Rumble in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SashaBanksWWE/comments/sm264k/sasha_banks_sailor_moon_attire_royal_rumble_2022/">Sailor Moon-inspired outfit</a> to serving as a presenter at this year‚Äôs <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24084825/anime-awards-2024-winners-list-jujutsu-kaisen-demon-slayer-chainsaw-man">Crunchyroll Anime Awards.</a></p>
<p id="Vu3wa5">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Varnado, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what‚Äôs your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="OEJsgv">My Favorite Anime is Polygon‚Äôs column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation to the series and films they love today. Here‚Äôs what Mercedes Varnado had to say.</p>
<hr id="7Y4S7K">
<h2 id="q7lPNH"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="vnJXss"><em>Sailor Moon</em> was a major success during its initial broadcast, extending past its planned six month production in 1992 to air multiple seasons over the course of five years. In combining the interpersonal drama and storytelling of magical girl anime with the action-oriented aesthetic of series like<em> Saint Seiya</em> and others, the series was able to win a dedicated audience that endures to this day. </p>
<p id="MuZYDs">The adventures of the teenage superheroine Sailor Moon and her fellow Sailor Guardians told a complex and emotionally resonant story, anchored by themes of love, friendship, and navigating the day-to-day challenges of adolescence. It was these qualities that allowed the series to successfully make the leap to audiences in the United States, standing out as one of, if not the, most notable female-centric action series of its time.</p>
<div id="ZZfBfO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UL_F6L1tSAM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="q9L7fx">The series also became well known for its trailblazing depiction of a same-sex relationship between Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, though this relationship was obfuscated and censored during the anime‚Äôs first broadcast in the West, with Uranus and Neptune being depicted as ‚Äúcousins‚Äù rather than lovers in the initial English dub of <em>Sailor Moon</em>. However, this omission has since been rectified in both subsequent releases of the 1992 anime and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22519700/pretty-guardian-sailor-moon-eternal-the-movie-review-netflix">other anime adaptations</a> of the series.</p>
<h2 id="Rr5DO3"><strong>What‚Äôs your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="TTMS62">Since the premiere of studio Bones‚Äô adaptation in 2016, <em>My Hero Academia</em> has remained one of the most popular anime series in recent memory, totaling at seven seasons and four feature-length films as of this writing. <em>My Hero Academia</em> was a series that hit at what felt like <em>precisely</em> the right time in the cultural zeitgeist, riding the wave of superhero popularity brought about by the likes of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23519049/best-marvel-movies-mcu-ranked-worst">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23578415/new-dc-movies-james-gunn-release-date-superman-batman-schedule-calendar-upcoming">DC Cinematic Universe</a> to tell an inspirational, high-spirited story about overcoming obstacles and aspiring to new heights against all odds. The story of Izuku ‚ÄúDeku‚Äù Midoriya, a powerless student in a world full of superheroes who becomes the apprentice of All Might, the most powerful hero of all, is a drama that channels the emotional dimension of Spider-Man and the moral clarity of Superman to create an uplifting saga about heroism triumphing over adversity.</p>
<div id="We0rFb"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1FdEBTJXus?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="2z28dS">Aside from Deku, both the anime and the manga boast a large supporting cast of characters whose respective arcs and personalities flesh out the series‚Äô overall exploration of what it means to be a hero. While arguably not as front and center as in the case of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, <em>My Hero Academia</em> features several notable female heroines including Ochaco Uraraka, Deku‚Äôs classmate and ally; Nana Shimura, All Might‚Äôs mentor and the prior possessor of ‚ÄúOne For All‚Äù; and Cathleen Bate, one of the most powerful heroes in the world who operates under the alias ‚ÄúStar and Stripe.‚Äù</p>
<p id="FC7pch">When juxtaposed alongside one another, there are obvious qualities that <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em> share with one another. Both series feature superheroes, yes, but on a deeper level, <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em> are about adolescents growing into their identities and responsibilities as young adults, tackling the challenges that come with both embracing their new abilities and balancing their obligations as heroes, and becoming stronger and wiser through overcoming adversity. In short: They‚Äôre stories tailor-made to speak to and inspire their audiences, so it‚Äôs no wonder then that both of these anime would mean so much to Varnado.</p>
<p id="VJhaYS"><small><em>Sailor Moon</em></small><small> is available to stream on Hulu. </small><small><em>My Hero Academia </em></small><small>is available to stream on Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Hulu.</small></p>

  <p id="gdRQ4E"><strong>Summer Game Fest 2024</strong> returns to take up the mantle of E3, now that the annual expo <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998280/e3-canceled-2023">is gone for good</a> after a run of almost two decades.</p>
<p id="2zYHQW">The good news, however, is gaming‚Äôs biggest conference season isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Though the Summer Game Fest showcase is headlining, the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, and Devolver are all returning to offer a week-long burst of news and announcements.</p>
<p id="5ZJIn5">In this guide, we‚Äôll run down the <strong>Summer Game Fest 2024 conference schedule</strong>, with dates and times across time zones in North America and Europe, and what to expect from each one.</p>

<hr id="PyUlFr">

<p id="bZcXfg">Here is when every conference will go live over the ‚ÄúE3‚Äù conference period. The bulk of the shows will take place around the second weekend of June, headlined by Summer Game Fest on Friday, June 7, and continuing until Monday with the likes of Ubisoft.</p>
<p id="Wavv9Y">By the time Summer Game Fest starts, Sony‚Äôs annual summer State of Play will have happened (on Thursday, May 30). We are still waiting for Nintendo to set a date for its June direct (<a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197">as confirmed on a post on X</a>). Based on previous years, they should fall within the same week as the below ‚Äì unless one platform holder wants to take the spotlight later in the month.</p>

<p id="ijCXw4">Friday is technically the start of Summer Game Fest, with the <strong>Access-Ability Summer Showcase</strong> (8 a.m. PDT / 11 a.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/LauraKBuzz">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/LauraKBuzz">Twitch</a>) beginning proceedings to highlight games by game developers with disabilities, and games with features and settings designed with players with disabilities in mind.</p>
<p id="swSVzm">Whitethorn Games (publisher of <em>Botany Manor</em>), Playtonic (<em>Yooka-Laylee </em>creator and publisher of upcoming rogue-like <em>Elsie</em>), and Fiction Factory Games (<em>Arcade Spirits</em>) are all confirmed to be in the mix so far, with showrunner Laura Kate Dale explaining that ‚Äúour aim is to make sure that if a game looks exciting, you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting hyped, only to learn later that a game doesn‚Äôt support your needs as a player.‚Äù</p>
<p id="iyA4D9">Following that a few hours later is the big one: the <strong>Summer Game Fest</strong> showcase (2 p.m. PDT / 5 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thegameawards">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a>). There are <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1791136531249578382">55 partners</a> signed up; how many of these will actually appear in the conference is uncertain, but since previous iterations of this event have run for at least a couple of hours, expect a fair few to show up. While specific reveals are under wraps at the time of this writing, we know <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718">2K will at least</a> ‚Äúreveal the next iteration‚Äù in one of its franchises during the show. Any guesses?</p>
<p id="LAKlnd">As tradition, the Summer Game Fest stream will immediately run into Double Fine and 8bit‚Äôs <strong>Day of the Devs </strong>(exact time TBC, streaming through the same feed as Summer Game Fest). <em>Karma: The Dark World</em>, <em>Phoenix Spring</em>, and Derek Yu‚Äôs <em>UFO 50</em> will make an appearance, among various new reveals.</p>
<p id="G9EsY9">Finally, Friday ends with <strong>Devolver Direct</strong> (5 p.m. PDT / 8 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DevolverDigital">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/devolverdigital">Twitch</a>). Once <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/they-paved-indie-paradise-to-put-up-a-parking-lot">famously hosted</a> in a parking lot across the street from E3 (to physically emphasize the contrast between events), the oddball developer eschewed that stunt last year ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no word yet on if it‚Äôll revive this year. With E3 dead, though, it‚Äôs unlikely. Anyway, expect lots of offbeat indies at this showcase.</p>

<p id="AqYw8F">The Saturday of not-E3 2024 is packed with back-to-back shows. Let‚Äôs break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li id="sYUmyF">First up is the<strong> Future of Play Direct</strong> (8 a.m. PDT / 11 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/heyglitch">YouTube</a>). Hosted by the V-tuber A.I. broadcaster Melios, no games have been announced yet. But if you miss the showcase, Glitch, the organizer of the event, <a href="https://heyglitch.com/future-of-play-direct/">said</a> a setlist will be available via its social media channels after the event wraps.</li>
<li id="bVDt52">That‚Äôs immediately followed by <strong>Wholesome Direct</strong> (9 a.m. PDT / 12 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WholesomeGames">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wholesome_games">Twitch</a>), a showcase focused on cozy games. For an example of what to expect, in previous years, Wholesome Direct has featured the likes of <em>Moonglow Bay</em>, <em>Bear and Breakfast</em>, and <em>Pupperazzi</em>.</li>
<li id="6P8AqE">The <strong>Latin America Games Showcase</strong> (10 a.m. PDT / 1 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lagshowcase">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lagshowcase">Twitch</a>) comes right on the heels of Wholesome Direct, and puts a spotlight on games developed in Latin America. More than 45 games are planned to appear at the event; you can see the whole list <a href="https://www.lagshowcase.com/">here</a>.</li>
<li id="EPR8qx">Shortly after that comes <strong>Women-led Games Summer Games Fest</strong> (11:30 a.m. PDT  / 2.30 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Women-LedGames">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/womenledgames">Twitch</a>). With a focus on games developed studios that are either led by or are majority staffed by women, Women-Led Games hosts a number of showcases per year. You can see the one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpS76GnvYQw">March 2024 here</a>.</li>
<li id="s5p3Cz">Finally, the day wraps with the <strong>Future Games Show</strong> (12 p.m. PDT / 3 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FutureGamesShow">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesradar">Twitch</a>). Unaffiliated with the earlier Future of Play event, the Future Games Show is <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/">GamesRadar‚Äôs</a> annual not-E3 event. This year, it‚Äôs hosted by <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‚Äôs Arthur Clark and <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>‚Äôs Britt Baron.</li>

<p id="29at4L">Headlining Sunday is the <strong>Xbox Games Showcase </strong>(9 a.m. PDT / 12 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/xbox">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox">Twitch</a>). This is Microsoft‚Äôs first showcase since its nearly $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard was finalized. Since then, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">closed studios</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050311/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-layoff">laid off</a> nearly 2,000 employees across its gaming department. This, of course, is the giant elephant in the room. While the matter likely won‚Äôt be addressed during the show, it will no doubt overshadow rumored announcements of things like a new entry in the Doom series or a potential reveal of an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23880201/xbox-series-x-mid-gen-refresh-brooklin-ellewood-sebile">all-digital Xbox Series X</a>.</p>
<p id="MRhLH9">Following the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft will host the <strong>Black Ops 6 Direct</strong> (exact time TBC, streaming through the same feed as Xbox). Immediately after its 2023 showcase, Microsoft held a 45-minute, in-depth stream for Bethesda‚Äôs <em>Starfield</em>; it‚Äôs safe to assume the Black Ops 6 Direct will be along the same lines. As with all of Microsoft‚Äôs first-party games to date, <em>Black Ops 6</em> will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">launch ‚Äúday one‚Äù</a> on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release">Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p id="cBDQ36">The Xbox-centric series of events is followed by the <strong>PC Gaming Show</strong> (1 p.m. PDT / 4 p.m. EDT, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pcgamer">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pcgamer">Twitch</a>). Hosted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-pc-gaming-show-2024-announcement/">PC Gamer</a>, the show will feature 50 games plus interviews with developers, though the publication hasn‚Äôt yet announced who will be partaking.</p>

<p id="DThxhT">As of this writing, not-E3 wraps up with <strong>Ubisoft Forward</strong> (TBC, streaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ubisoft">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ubisoft">Twitch</a>). The purveyor of icon-saturated map games already has a heavy slate in the fall, with the likes of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows</em></a>. Expect more details about both games. Less likely? An update on <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, which has been infamously (and very publicly) mired in development hell for years. But hey, anything can happen!</p>

<p>The various expeditions in No Man‚Äôs Sky shake up the usual exploration-based gameplay of the vanilla game by providing unique circumstances and modifiers to the game. For instance, in the upcoming No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift, you‚Äôll find yourself completely alone. There are no other alien lifeforms besides hostile fauna and ghostly ships. If you want to participate, it‚Äôs worth your time. Here are all of the unique rewards in No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-many-unique-rewards-in-no-man-s-sky-adrift">The Many Unique Rewards in No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift</h2>



<p>There are a handful of new rewards in No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift, including cosmetics, buildable items, and starships. Here‚Äôs everything you can unlock by playing through the expedition:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Posters</strong>: Meditation, Alone in the Dark, and Isolation
<ul>
<li>These unique posters allow you to bring a sense of personalization to the wide reaches of space, no matter where you choose to build a habitat!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Paint</strong>
<ul>
<li>A unique paint scheme for your starships that helps create a low-radar signature. It doesn‚Äôt appear to have any unique gameplay effects, but it looks cool!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Starship Wreckage Base Parts</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you‚Äôre a fan of the base-building components in No Man‚Äôs Sky, these unique base components will allow you to craft a scrapyard-like base with the remains of a downed starship overtaken by flora.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Gnawing Scuttler Companion</strong>
<ul>
<li>A unique, crab-like companion pet extracted from a derelict freighter lost in space. It‚Äôs designed to suppress violent tendencies towards its master.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong> Ship of the Damned</strong>
<ul>
<li>A long-lost frigate that, despite having no active crew, continues to roam the stars.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Iron Vulture</strong>
<ul>
<li>A unique starship‚Äîa high-capacity Hauler with an industrial metal color scheme, with scrappable components that allow you to build a new hauler ship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-no-man-s-sky-adrift">How to Play No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift</h2>



<p>You can start playing No Man‚Äôs Sky Adrift this week, according to Sean Murray. The new expedition is available through the Expedition Terminus on the Space Anomaly. Or, if you‚Äôd rather start a fresh save, you can create a new game save file and start directly in the Adrift Expedition. Once the seven-week-long expedition concludes, your save file will automatically convert to a regular save file so that you may keep playing!</p>

<p>Remedy Games could be teasing Alan Wake 2 DLC. That‚Äôs what many are assuming after the studio <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1795832621533917371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated their social media profile</a> from Remedy Games to ‚ÄúPoison Pill Entertainment‚Äù on Wednesday.</p>



<p>They‚Äôve even updated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RemedyGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their YouTube channel</a> to ‚ÄúPoison Pill Entertainment‚Äù.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Night Springs is a (fictional) town in Arizona that acts as a location within the Alan Wake Universe. Night Springs also happens to be a TV in the universe that acts as a parody of The Twilight Zone.</p>



<p>Alan Wake 2 was released in October 2023, and became Remedy‚Äôs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúfastest-selling game‚Äù ever.</a> At that time, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the studio wasn‚Äôt done with the game after the success of its release.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe will continue to develop the game to serve existing fans and attract new players and expect the game to continue selling well,‚Äù he said.</p>



<p>Geoff Keighley even acknowledged the change, leading some to think that a reveal could happen at Summer Games Fest on June 7. Even Remedy creative director <a href="https://x.com/SamLakeRMD/status/1791931680955027607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Lake has hinted to something</a> being revealed at the event.</p>

                <p>No Man's Sky has been out for almost eight years now, but players have never been able to feel truly alone within its massive star systems. That's set to change with the game's recent update, <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/05/expedition-thirteen-adrift/" rel="nofollow ">Expedition 13: Adrift</a>, which radically refocuses the game at a basic level.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in the blog post announcing the update, Adrift is intended to capture the feeling of early, unreleased versions of No Man's Sky, when there were "no NPCs, no shops, [and] no help." To achieve this, the update removes all lifeforms from the game, and renders all buildings broken and rusted. It also increases the number of sandworms and fiend eggs the player encounters. However, it's not all bad, as there is a "ghostly frigate" that players can encounter, as well as a Hauler starship called the Iron Vulture that will help players out.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky Adrift Expedition Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Adrift also brings a number of other changes to the game, including more ship customization, more multiplayer missions at the Space Anomaly Nexus, and Adrift-specific rewards and collectibles.

The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.</p>

<p>The patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman‚Äôs playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra &amp; Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/will-ea-fc-24-have-a-euro-2024-promo/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=will-ea-fc-24-have-a-euro-2024-promo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 promo could be a surprise hit with <em>EA FC 24 </em>Ultimate Team players and breathe new life into it following the TOTS celebrations.</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Euro 2024 will kick off in June and pit the best of Europe against each other. To celebrate this special tournament, EA Sports is reportedly planning to release an exclusive promo in Ultimate Team. While the developers have remained tight-lipped as of this writing, FUT Scoreboard, a reliable source for leaks in the past, has provided the information on X.</p>  <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">For now, it‚Äôs all speculation, but our best guess places a Euro 24 promo for <em>EA FC 24</em> on June 14. The actual Euro 2024 begins on June 14, too, with the first contest featuring Germany and Scotland. We‚Äôre assuming it‚Äôll go live around the same time, putting it a week after the <em>EA FC 24 </em>TOTS promo ends on June 7.</p>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">As things stand, it‚Äôs unclear what plans EA Sports has for the unique promo. The upcoming set of cards could create the same frenzy we saw earlier in <em>FIFA 23</em> when the World Cup-themed items were released. For the time being, it‚Äôs best to wait patiently until EA Sports makes the news official. </p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">There haven‚Äôt been many rumors so far, as the TOTS promo is active. However, the leaks indicate that the Euro 2024 promo could have its own versions of Heroes and Icons. The Heroes and Icons are always pretty popular, and a new version will certainly incentivize many players to continue playing after the TOTS promo.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="false">It will be interesting to find out which footballers will get unique cards in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> as part of the Euro promo. For the time being, players can start preparing for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-90-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Ultimate TOTS promo</a>, which goes live on Friday, May 31. It will feature some of the best rewards from the previous TOTS lineups and give the community a great chance to get their hands on some really strong items.</p>

            <p>It‚Äôs been a little while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-co-creator-of-skins-became-the-lead-writer-on-an-upcoming-aaa-open-world-game">since we last heard</a> about the untitled open-world driving game from Maverick Games, the studio opened a couple of years back by ex-Playground Games veterans including former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> creative director Mike Brown. We still don‚Äôt know what the team‚Äôs new game is called or when it might hit the road, but we have been given a few more snippets of what to expect and news on who‚Äôll be helping pump up its tires and fill it with fuel as publisher.</p>

<p>As well as the obvious racing game experience of the Playground devs (along with other devs who‚Äôve worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world games</a> like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>), the untitled driving game is mixing in an element that Brown and team feel reckon will set it apart: a closer focus on its story and characters, with what Brown describes as a ‚Äúhuman connection‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLots of great driving games have amazing gameplay, amazing content,‚Äù <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/maverick-games-mike-brown-interview">said</a> Brown. ‚ÄúBut to really cross that bridge, to become a game that people genuinely love, then there needs to be that human connection where you‚Äôre actually rooting for these characters, falling in love with these characters.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat, I think, is a place where our game will be able to really differentiate itself from the other titles in the genre. There‚Äôs nothing about this genre that prevents it from having amazing characters and amazing stories - it‚Äôs just not really been explored yet.‚Äù</p>

<p>Helping with the ‚Äúnarrative-led‚Äù portion of the game is lead writer Jamie Brittain, who co-created Channel 4‚Äôs era-defining noughties teen drama Skins. Brown said that Brittain‚Äôs knack for creating characters who are ‚Äúflawed and actually a little bit weird - just like the rest of us‚Äù (though presumably quite good at driving regardless) will come through in the game‚Äôs story. While Brown mentions that "human connection", I quite like the idea of a gritty Cars-like world full of sentient vehicles going to driving school by day and partying in grotty clubs by night.</p>
<p>Maverick is now up to more than 60 devs from the ten or so that founded it back in 2022, and has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/maverick-games-publishing-agreement">inked a fresh deal</a> with Amazon Games to publish their debut ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù racing game across PC and consoles - making it Amazon‚Äôs latest game after the likes of MMOs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">Crystal Dynamics‚Äô next Tomb Raider game</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">a Lord of the Rings MMO</a> also in the works.

  <p id="h3xpn4">The World Series of Poker may have its coveted bracelet, but the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> trading card game now has its own piece of hardware for its highest-performing players. Naturally, it‚Äôs a golden Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p id="vNoWXD">The very first <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/play_/lorcana-challenge#schedule">Lorcana Challenge regional tournaments</a> were held over the Memorial Day weekend, with two-day events taking place in both Lille, France and Atlanta, Georgia. The game‚Äôs publisher, Ravensburger, confirmed Wednesday to Polygon that the tournament in Lille concluded first by just a few hours. That means Frank Karsten, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Pro Tour player and a member of the <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>Hall of Fame, is the world‚Äôs first Lorcana Challenge champion. </p>

<p>Black Ops 6 is set to be revealed worldwide in little more than a week, and fans are excited. It‚Äôs poised to be the best Call of Duty game in several years and marks a grand return to Black Ops, arguably the most popular sub-franchise in the Call of Duty series. In recent days, leaks have been sneaking online courtesy of several insiders, and the most recent tidbit has revealed key art for the Vault Edition and Standard Edition of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>This leak includes some intense art of ‚ÄòZombie Woods‚Äô.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vault-edition-confirmed">Vault Edition Confirmed</h2>



<p>The Vault Edition is typically the highest digital edition of Call of Duty these days, boasting fully unlocked weapon sets, high-tier battle passes, exclusive operator skins, and more. Recently, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795851896214729148/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">key art surfaced online</a> suggesting that the Vault Edition will be heavily geared towards the Zombies offering that‚Äôs going to be available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Also included in the leaks was a ‚ÄòStandard Edition‚Äô print ‚Äì which is assumed to be the base game and nothing more ‚Äì and a shot of Frank Woods as a dishevelled, chewed-up Zombies-like character. Not only that but the leaks revealed that Park, Adler, and Klaus will also be surfacing in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/">will be released on Game Pass</a> on day one, coming to PC and Xbox consoles free for those with a subscription. This was somewhat expected, but the confirmation was a shocker ‚Äì it‚Äôs not yet known if other Call of Duty titles will follow suit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-road-to-glory-mode-nil<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We learn more about all the features that are coming to College Football 25.</h2></div><section><p>Just a few weeks after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-first-trailer-revealed">properly revealing</a> College Football 25, EA has shared new details on its long-awaited return to college football video games, such as how name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals will work and what other things we have seen in prior college football games will not return. </p><p>Among other details, EA confirmed that Road to Glory will not be including the high school season found in previous NCAA Football games, which allowed players to play at the prep level for an abbreviated season before heading to college. Instead, Road to Glory players in College Football 25 will select their star level and other attributes while creating their player, after which they will begin their collegiate career.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dynasty Mode, meanwhile, will return largely intact, though players will not be able to export draft classes from College Football 25 into <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25">Madden NFL Football 25</a>. While EA did not explain why the feature was removed, College Football 25 is notable for being the first in the series to use real-world student-athletes.</p><p>Other absences include Mascot Mode, in which players could dress up as the mascot of their respective academic institution and play football. Additionally, College Football 25 will not have the ESPN license, like previous games such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/09/ncaa-football-11-review">NCAA Football 11</a>, meaning ESPN-style presentations like College GameDay will not be available, despite EPSN talent like Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit being available for commentary. </p><h2><strong>Out with the old</strong></h2><p>Despite some noticeable absences, EA did share new details on recent additions to the college football landscape ‚Äî most notably the transfer portal and NIL deals. </p><p>The development team explained that NIL ‚Äî which in real life allows players to make money on sponsorships and other deals ‚Äî was tough for them to implement in Dynasty Mode, but did say that it will be an influential component in the mode. Road to Glory, meanwhile, will allow players to sign NIL deals of their own. </p><p>EA teased that depending on the NIL deal your player obtains, it can influence things like attributes for your character. However, College Football's developers did not elaborate further. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In the meantime, College Football 25 will also implement the transfer portal, allowing Dynasty Mode players to try and get players to commit to their institution while keeping their own rosters intact. The transfer portal was first introduced in 2018, making it one of the biggest changes to come to college football since the release of the last NCAA Football game. Its implementation was a key question mark for fans ahead of College Football 25's reveal.</p><p>To enhance the immersion and spirit of college football, EA also confirmed that both costumed and real animal mascots will be available. EA previously teased the inclusion of various mascots, such as Florida State's Chief Osceola riding Renegade, the University of Texas animal mascot Bevo, and University of Florida's Albert Gator in <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/college-football-25-official-reveal-trailer">the first official trailer</a>. </p><p>College Football 25 will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date">be released on July 19</a> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It‚Äôs been over a decade and an entire console generation since we last had a new college football game to sink our teeth into. So, you can imagine the surprise to many (myself included) when EA Sports <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1356644353901539342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> over three years ago that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-is-returning-for-the-first-time-since-2013">once again make a college football video game</a>. I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on, and I am happy to say that in my brief time with College Football 25, I ended up leaving with as much excitement as I had when I arrived. </p><p>Graphically speaking, College Football 25 is gorgeous. From small things such as how players wear their uniforms, to the realistic grass and turf on fields, College Football 25‚Äôs graphics are, as you‚Äôd expect after such a long layoff, a significant leg up from what we saw in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/05/ncaa-football-14-review">NCAA Football 14</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Graphics aside, the vibes of College Football 25 are immaculate. Any college football fan will tell you that school spirit, traditions, and pride from the fandom deliver an unprecedented passion you otherwise would not normally see from most professional sports leagues. From the energetic broadcasts from Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbsteirt, to Clemson Football players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCLt6VPudwk&amp;pp=ygUmQ2xlbXNvbiBGb290YmFsbCBEZWF0aCBWYWxsZXkgaGlsbCBydW4%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running enthusiastically down The Hill in Death Valley</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYuSCk1EFxg&amp;pp=ygUWUFNVIEZvb3RiYWxsIFdoaXRlIE91dA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White Out game at Penn State</a>, College Football 25 absolutely conveyed that college pride and enthusiasm. </p><p>New-gen visuals are nice, but the biggest addition to College Football 25 is the inclusion of real-life student-athletes, as the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/14-16601/14-16601-2015-09-30.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O‚ÄôBannon case happened</a> since the last time EA made a College Football game. Gone are the days when we had generic faces and names; these are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-will-pay-players-to-use-their-likeness">actual players</a> who voluntarily chose to opt in, each with their name, image, and likeness (NIL) present to attempt to recreate those athletes in virtual form. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All these players present are not created equal, and if there is a major mismatch, it will be exploited.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Gameplay-wise, while many quickly point out that the same developer makes both Madden and College Football, College Football 25 is no junior-sized version of Madden. Prominent gameplay mechanics in modern Madden NFL games like X Factor are not present, though throw power, accuracy, and hit sticks are present. </p><p>Additionally, the skills and overall level of each school vary greatly‚Äîa match between Alabama and Georgia is going to look radically different from a game between Coastal Carolina and Michigan. This matches much more with the consistency of the real-world programs, recruiting, and rosters of each of the 134 FBS teams, which can lead to some uneven play, depending on the matchups you set up. All these players present are not created equal, and if there is a major mismatch, it will be exploited. </p><p>One key distinction to point out between the core gameplay of both College Football 25 and Madden is that the former is undoubtedly faster, from the agility of running backs and how they juke to the snappiness of a spin move. The speed of College Football 25 also means there is minimal room for error. During my session, I played a few rounds of Play Now, and each team I played as had an extremely tight window for which you had time to perfectly throw your pass, ensuring it did not result in an incomplete or an interception. The faster-paced gameplay may be off-putting, but the faster gameplay makes this a good starting point for newcomers to football sims and might even help novice Madden players who invest enough time into College Football 25. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Official Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, to maintain the level of immersion seen in College Football, EA Orlando is introducing a new Wear &amp; Tear system designed to replicate real-life scenarios that can impact players in this sport. While selecting a play in Play Now, for example, I could see my QB's full body schematic to show his body's wear and tear. If he was taking a lot of hits, it could impact his throwing ability. Wear &amp; Tear is a risk factor system meant to challenge you both in managing the game and deciding whether to play it safe or perform a potentially high-risk, high reward coaching maneuver by keeping an injured player on the field. </p><p>College Football 25 has four modes: the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-wont-be-released-until-summer-2024">returning fan-favorite Road to Glory and Dynasty Mode</a>, College Football Ultimate Team, and the all-new Road to the College Football Playoffs. Each mode aims to replicate the real-life adjustments and changes made to the overall landscape of College Football in recent years. </p><p>And yes, the transfer portal will impact both Road to Glory and Dynasty Mode, and NIL deals will be key for your players. However, the extent to which NIL deals will impact players in both modes, particularly in the case of Road to Glory, where the development team teases that you can alter your player‚Äôs overall performance and skills, remains to be seen. </p><p>Road to Glory is still the standard single-player experience where you create a player and strive for glory, whether it's racking up individual accolades or looking to win the College Football National Championship. You‚Äôll pick between one of five positions: QB, WR, RB, MLB, or CB in addition to your Star Level, along with present individual attributes that will allow you to lean into some strengths over others. Will you choose to be the QB that can scramble and be a dual-threat, or someone with a cannon for an arm? That‚Äôs all up to you. </p><p>Road to Glory also emphasizes the ‚Äústudent‚Äù in student-athletes than what was previously seen in the NCAA Football series, as players will need to balance multiple categories that will impact their academic performance, trust-building with their coach and teammates, and what type of NIL deals they can obtain. Time management and how you make your decisions when you are not at class, practice, and games will factor into your character's overall perception, performance, and where they stand on the depth chart. Your position is always at risk, depending on your choices and your player‚Äôs overall performance. </p><p>Like previous iterations, Dynasty Mode flips the script compared to Road to Glory, allowing you to play as a coach. You can start out as a head coach, or have humbler beginnings as either an offensive or defensive coordinator. Each has its own skill trees you can choose from, whether it‚Äôs one that can boost team morale or do a great job at snagging recruits to commit and sign. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25: First Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Recruiting also maintains a multi-layer aspect that goes beyond just the star-caliber players. Some recruits will express interest in playing time, others will express interest in attending a school with high academic prowess, some may care more about how close to home it is, and others will care more about winning a National Championship. All these things, combined with what the school you choose has to offer and when you choose to schedule them to come for an official visit, will impact the odds you can sway a recruit to play for you. Even when you schedule players to take a visit, they can play at these odds.</p><p>Your performance in your team will also determine if other schools will try to poach you. With the mode supporting up to 30 seasons, you could start as an offensive coordinator and work up to a promotion at the same school or leave and head coach at another institution. </p><p>Unfortunately, EA did not dive into College Football Ultimate Team, but we did learn about the brand-new mode called Road to the College Football Playoffs. This online-only mode is ranked, where players will pick a team and battle online against other players as they race to win a national championship. As is common with ranked modes, you start off as a Recruit, but can work your way up to Heisman; the higher you go, the tougher players you will face online, but in theory, it should provide better balance and still maintain the competitive edge for players, regardless of skill level. </p><p>Though my time was brief, and there‚Äôs still a lot we don‚Äôt know, I am nevertheless eagerly awaiting my chance to play the final build of College Football 25 when it releases on July 19. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

It's a strong start for the free-to-play brawler on PC (Sony and Microsoft do not publish player numbers for PlayStation and Xbox.)</p><p>Not everyone is happy with the changes developer Player First Games made during the hiatus, however, and MultiVersus has dropped to an overall "Mixed" perception on Steam as a result of negative reviews. Changes to mechanics, the removal of certain features, and intrinsic monetization headline the complaints, with some fans even saying this final version of MultiVersus "feels more like a beta than the beta."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"They‚Äôve taken away more features than they‚Äôve added.</p></div><p>"They‚Äôve taken away more features than they‚Äôve added. The camera being zoomed and team color options removed is pretty crazy in my opinion, on top of a list of other really important changes like locking characters even in practice range," Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2vd4s/this_feels_more_like_a_beta_than_the_beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radbrad4333</a> wrote.</p><p>"When Marvel Rivals is in a playtest alpha and can launch with a competitive mode, built in tournament system, and relatively well-balanced characters, and this game launches like this after nearly half a year of public playtesting... I don‚Äôt get it. They were supposed to learn lessons in the beta and I know it‚Äôs early, but after playing most of today, this feels like a miss."</p><p>MultiVersus was originally released in July 2022 but many didn't realize its status as an open beta due to its battle pass and other microtransactions, additional downloadable characters, and so on. After <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-peak-player-count-plummets-to-below-1000-amid-content-drought">the game's numbers had dwindled to under 1,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, Player First Games announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-early-access-closing-in-june-full-release-window-confirmed">the beta would come to an end in June 2023</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>MultiVersus Characters</h3></div></output><p>"Throughout our open beta, we‚Äôve been working hard to build the best gameplay experience, and we appreciate all of the inspiration you‚Äôve given us," co-founder and game director Tony Huynh said at the time. "Our open beta has been an important learning opportunity for us and a stepping stone to the next phase of MultiVersus."</p><p>But as noted by myriad players online, the full version of MultiVersus is lacking several features the beta did. "Let's give it up for Warner Bros. and Player First Games for killing the offline scene by removing the complete offline roster," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2o74n/lets_give_it_up_for_wb_and_pfg_for_killing_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doinky420</a> said on Reddit. "Other honorable mentions go to not being able to test characters before buying them and removing options that people built muscle memory with."</p><p>Another post from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2wi9s/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sloppybuttons</a> lists "everything that changed for the worse from the beta period", which includes battle changes like no leaderboards or after battle report, and mode changes like the removal of cooperative battles against AI and no free for all mode with items. It also points to more loading screens, removed input options, and more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Let's give it up for Warner Bros. and Player First Games for killing the offline scene by removing the complete offline roster.</p></div><p>Players are otherwise frustrated with the economy in this version of MultiVersus. While it's a free-to-play game (with the likes of a battle pass and other microtransactions that let players buy skins and new characters), many players are complaining about major changes to how monetization works.</p><p>A cheaper tier of characters available for 1,500 Fighter Currency (one of the in-game currencies) are no longer available, with every character now costing between 3,000 and 6,000 each, or with 1,000 to 1,250 Gleamium (the main premium currency bought with real money). The cheapest players can buy Gleamium is in a pack of 450 for $4.99 while its most expensive and best value pack comes with 6,000 and costs $49.99.</p><p>These bundles have specifically caused frustration too, as an uncommon skin costs 500 Gleamium, meaning the cheapest $4.99 bundle doesn't quite grant players enough to buy one. This is a common technique used to keep players spending. "Scummy as hell," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1d2xdcr/uncommon_skins_cost_500_gleamium_and_499_gets_you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IWantTheDomoHat</a>. "No one wants to spend $10 for what should be a $5 skin. Please change it to 500 Gleamium. I think I can speak on the behalf of everyone that this is absurd."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Only five characters are available for free at launch too, and the rest of roster must be unlocked with Fighter Currency, which is earned through completing missions, seasonal events, single-player mode Rifts, and the battle pass, or with Gleamium. Players who want the full roster immediately must therefore pay, using the cheapest options available, $155.</p><p>This will give players access to every character, but not the extensive collection of skins, announcer packs, animated ringouts, profile icons, and so on, which are all available at an additional cost. A bundle which includes one skin, stance, emotes, voice over, and a ringout for Shaggy is currently available on sale for 2,444 Gleamium instead of 3,325. Players purchasing the $20 Gleamium pack will, again, find themselves just short of that amount with 2,200 total.</p><p>This pack is on the cheaper end of the many on offer too, with others costing as much as 3,390 Gleamium on sale or 4,525 usually. This one includes a banner on top of what's included in the Shaggy bundle, and would cost players $35 at its discounted price or $45 usually.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think I can speak on the behalf of everyone that this is absurd.</p></div><p>"They spent a year making literally everything gameplay wise worse and on implementing f**king currencies, stories, FOMO, and mobile game level grind gems for player versus everyone upgrades," wrote Patrick on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>. "So much potential wasted due to baffling decisions and corporate greed," wrote another user.</p><p>"They locked the ability to test out characters and skins in practice, removed our universal currency of Gold and replaced it with three different [mobile game] bulls**t currencies, including 'prestige' which is basically a VIP system. Pay more money, get more prestige currency, use prestige currency to unlock the most wanted cosmetics."</p><p>MultiVersus still pulled in a good number of players despite these complaints, but Player First Games knows from experience that number can quickly fall. Fans are therefore hoping it moves to address the community's complaints quickly.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
