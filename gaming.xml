            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-cancelled-shooter-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>1428850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>







<p>What do you think Mirror Pond would have looked like? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>No, not that one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Pokémon is celebrating 30 years this year, and as part of this, trainers around the globe can expect all sorts of exciting (and surprising) announcements.</p>
<p>Ahead of the annual event Pokémon Day, taking place later this month on 27th February 2026, Stern Pinball has announced it will be stepping into the battle arena with its very own themed pinball cabinet. And yes, we're referring to an <em>actual</em> pinball cabinet here (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_pinball">not a video game</a>).</p>
<p>The price of admission? Well, according to the <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">official landing page</a>, it'll be <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">available in three varieties</a> and is "coming soon". The Pro model starts at <strong>$6,999</strong>, the premium model is <strong>$9,699</strong> and the "highly collectible Limited Edition model" is going for <strong>$12,999</strong>. This particular model is also <strong>limited to 750 units</strong> "globally".</p>

<p>If you want <a href="https://pokemon.sternpinball.com/landing-page/pokemon">future updates about this cabinet</a> and when exactly it drops, you can sign up for email updates on the official website. And if you're ready to purchase or happen to be a business owner (or just want to enquire about one), you can also fill out a form for that.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the prices for this Pokémon cabinet are in line with the current offerings on Stern's website, which include cabinets based on series such as Star Wars, X-Men, and Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Here's what the critics had to say</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="d245c705831a7"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d245c705831a7/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's an action-packed week on the Nintendo front, and on top of the Partner Direct, we also shared a bunch of previews earlier this week.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our preview for Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park we're not so sure about it so far. Here's what staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, I’m struggling to find much of a reason to splash out on the £16.99 / $19.99 Upgrade Pack for Mario Wonder so far. I did take note of just how sharp, clean, and vibrant the visuals were in the Switch 2 Edition, so that <em>might</em> be just enough to convince me to make a leap. But if the multiplayer modes were meant to tempt me into a purchase, I’m afraid they’ve largely failed in their task."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196663 @ 1770456094 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say? Here's the round up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/03/amusing-attractions-in-an-attractive-amusement-park">Game Informer</a>: "Meetup in Bellabel Park is about what I expected based on the trailers, and that's a good thing. I had a great time in Attraction Central, and knowing there are so many more stages in each minigame has me looking forward to playing the full release with some family on my couch."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/super-mario-bros-wonder-dlc-meetup-bellabel-park-preview/">Polygon</a>: "<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, <em>Jamboree TV</em>, and <em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em> all serve similar purposes: They show what kind of play is possible with Switch 2 and leave you excited to see what Nintendo can do in a full Mario Party or WarioWare game. The novelty factor that currently makes add-ons like this fun to toy around with is bound to wear off before the console’s one-year anniversary. If mouse controls are going to be more than a bonus gimmick, we’re going to need some more substantial games that make use of the feature soon."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-meetup-in-bellabel-park/">DualShockers</a>: "If you have a friend group you can line up to play together with on a game night, or perhaps some gamer kiddos on hand in your household, Super Mario Bros. Wonder for the Switch 2 is absolutely going to be a winner that you can break out time and time again."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">IGN</a>: "Each game certainly had some fun to offer, but afterwards I couldn’t help but feel like this concept is awkwardly straddling the line: if I wanted multiplayer mayhem with Mario characters, there are so many other, better options like Mario Kart, Party, or 3D World, just to name a few. And, if I wanted 2D Mario, I’d much rather play the traditional Super Mario Bros. Wonder campaign, which I adore. To be completely fair, there is more traditional content on the way in Wonder’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition in the form of Wonder Effect boss fights against the returning Koopalings and extra challenges that take place in pre-existing levels, but I didn’t get to try any of that at this preview event. Even so, none of this Edition’s additions currently feel as exciting as a couple of extra brand-new worlds likely would have."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-wonder-turns-into-mario-party-with-the-bellabel-park-expansion/1100-6537843/">GameSpot</a>: "None of these minigames would be worth the price of admission on their own, but altogether, the package looks to be substantial. We only got a taste of a handful of the minigames during our multiplayer session, and each one we tried had multiple difficulty levels with different stages to try. I also got the sense that there was more to be discovered, possibly through the collection of those special coins that were so tricky to get during the cooperative stages."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57278-hands-on-with-switch-2-s-early-2026-lineup-mario-tennis-fever-meetup-in-bellabel">GoNintendo</a>: "Your interest in this add-on will likely be dependent on how often you’re able to get a group of friends together to play. If you’ve got a core gaming group, and you’re the type who likes a silly collection of multiplayer games in the vein of Nintendo Land or Mario Party, Bellabel Park should fit the bill."</p>

<p>It's available at select Best Buy, GameStop, Target and Walmart Stores in the US. And in Canada, you can take to the court at Best Buy and Walmart.</p>
<p>Nintendo's in-store Switch 2 kiosks have also offered demos for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Unfortunately, there's no mention of this latest first-party demo being made available on the eShop (<em>at least yet</em>), but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although we didn't share a full preview of this title, Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds recently went hands on with the new entry, and thinks Mario Tennis fans will be "absolutely thrilled" with the new title. We've also done a previews round up if you would like to find out more about this new game.</p>

<p>In some related news, earlier this week, Nintendo announced it would be <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/serve-up-fun-mario-tennis-fever-feb-12-nintendo-san-francisco/">hosting special launch events</a> for Mario Tennis Fever at its stores in New York and San Francisco. These events will feature the game demo, photo ops, a gift alongside the purchase of the title and more.</p>

<figure data-uuid="a41c3ac65d5b9"><a title="Console Archives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a41c3ac65d5b9/console-archives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hamster Corporation</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's Partner Direct was loaded with all sorts of surprises, and one of the biggest announcements for retro fans was Hamster Corporation's reveal of its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-is-the-closest-well-get-to-virtual-console-in-2026">Console Archives series</a> for Switch 2 (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/the-arcade-only-rave-racer-drifts-onto-ps5-this-month-console-archives-also-coming-soon">and PlayStation 5</a>).</p>
<p>This will revive classic games, originally released on home consoles, on modern hardware. Two titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-ninja-gaiden-ii-the-dark-sword-of-chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> are already available on the Switch 2 eShop, so what else is on the way?</p>
<p>Hamster has now provided details about what else is on the way in its <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIlTJyYR30">latest Japanese broadcast</a>. It features many of the games showcased in the initial announcement. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-doraemon">Doraemon</a> by Hudson has been dated for July, but the rest of these games don't have a release date just yet.</p>
<p>For now, here's what's on the way in the near future (via Gematsu):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong> (Tecmo 8-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Cool Boarders</strong> (UEP Systems, 32-bit) – <strong>Out now</strong> for Switch 2<br>
- <strong>Doraemon</strong> (Hudson, 8-bit) – <strong>30th July 2026</strong><br>
- <strong>Nobunaga’s Ambition</strong> (KOEI, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>MagMax</strong> (Nichibutsu, 8-bit)<br>
- <strong>Sonic Wings Special</strong> (Video System, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Dezaemon Plus</strong> (Atena, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</strong> (Nippon Ichi Software, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia</strong> (Toshiba-EMI, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>Monster Rancher Hop A Bout</strong> (Tecmo, 32-bit)<br>
- <strong>UFO: A day in the life</strong> (ASCII, 32-bit)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the Arcade Archives series, Hamster's Console Archives series is "packed with convenient features". This includes customisable button layouts and screen settings, as well as the ability to save and load at any point.</p>
<p>Apart from its reveal of Console Archives, Hamster also announced it would be adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-rave-racer">Rave Racer</a> to its Arcade Archives collection on 26th February 2026.</p>

<p>Capcom has finally released its demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2 and some side-by-side comparisons to the other versions of the game have now been shared online.</p>
<p>If you are wondering this version holds up, according to <a href="https://youtu.be/64-XoEHbp-o">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, the Switch 2 will run at a lower resolution than the Xbox Series S version, but upscaling is supposedly better on Nintendo's console. This is also said to apply to the Switch 2's filtering and shadow quality, which shows "better results".</p>
<p>As for the game's frame rate, all consoles target 60fps, but the Switch 2 release apparently struggles to maintain this frame rate during more heated moments.</p>

<p>Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">recently previewed Pragmata</a> and had the following things to say about the game's performance and resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt pretty stable and consistent during my time with it. There are a few visual downgrades compared to the likes of PS5 with some muddy textures and a slightly fuzzy resolution, but it’s a handsome game nonetheless with impressive lighting and a strong art style."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you tried out the Pragmata demo on the Switch 2 yet? What are your thoughts so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <guid>1428775</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftl-like-void-war-dmcad-allegedly-by-games-workshop-0" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0fe5dc8-146f-4c11-b6a8-2b5f2365e5bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two weeks ago when we reported </a>that <em>Void War</em> had been DMCA'd by a party claiming to be Games Workshop. Now, we can confirm that it was indeed Games Workshop that filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA as Tundra Interactive has told us more about this story, and how <em>Void War</em> is back up on Steam now.</p><p>After failing to communicate with Tundra Interactive for a week, Games Workshop finally replied, and confirmed that the <em>Void War</em> DMCA was on their behalf. That means that Games Workshop does employ a lawyer named Mal Reynolds, despite how unlikely that seemed, and it is a deeply ironic name given the <em>Firefly</em> character with the same name. Tundra Interactive explains what issue Games Workshop had with <em>Void War</em>:</p><blockquote><p>They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</p></blockquote><p>Tundra Interactive emphasizes that all the artwork in the trailer for <em>Void War</em> was original work created by their artists. Despite that, in the goal of a fast resolution, they have removed the story trailer that had the offending image. With that done, they were able to get the game back up on Steam. Tundra Interactive stated, "We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations." saying that new versions of the trailer may come.</p><p>It is possible to view the trailer via a <a href="https://video.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257147370/movie_max.mp4" rel="nofollow">link from SteamDB</a> which has an image at 34 seconds which match the description given by Games Workshop, as well as confirmed by Tundra Interactive that it is the offending image.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Games Workshop has a history of being... very protective of its IP, dating back to actions like trying to trademark the term <a href="https://gizmodo.com/games-workshop-is-still-claiming-to-own-the-trademark-t-5982201" rel="nofollow">Space Marine</a>, to the contentious relationship with fans over things like fan animations that they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games-workshop-is-trying-to-shut-down-fan-animations/" rel="nofollow">took steps to ban</a>.</p><p>We previously reached out to Games Workshop, but they did not reply regarding whether they had filed the DMCA against Tundra Interactive.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, all's well that ends well and Tundra Interactive can get back to making their game without further legal hurdles. <em>Void War </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/" rel="nofollow">available on Steam </a>and also <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io</a>, which will also provide a Steam key.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1428742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I bought a Riffmaster Wireless Guitar this weekend because they were $50 off (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/RIFFMASTER-Controller-Xbox-Rechargeable-Officially-Microsoft/dp/B0CWN15TRF?th=1">and still are, I believe</a>). I have been hunting for a full Rock Band 4 set at a reasonable price for a few years, and it has been a futile exercise. But the Riffmaster guitar, plus Fortnite Festival, has gotten me close to the nostalgic Rock Band/Guitar Hero experience I have been pining for. I was initially underwhelmed by the song selection. It had some music I liked, but it was limited, and there is no simple option to outright buy songs that have been available to play in the past. I know this is the standard Fortnite operating procedure – arbitrary limitations on digital goods in order to exploit the player base (which I remind you is mostly children) into making purchases because they won't be available soon. Everything sucks and I hate it.</p><p>But, moving on from that ongoing frustration with modern video games, I was surprised to learn the song selection gets swapped out often. Daily, it seems. Which means logging in every day provides new songs. And today, in particular, the selection lined up much more with my taste. Chappell Roan songs (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PINzY8ErwGo">not surprising considering she was recently added to the game</a> [but no "Pink Pony Club" which <em>is</em> surprising]), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NocXEwsJGOQ">Hatsune Miku and Anamanguchi mash-up</a>, Fall Out Boy music from their first album (I never listened to any of the other ones), and "Welcome Home" from Coheed &amp; Cambria. I played a bunch of great songs and I will see what's new tomorrow. They've hooked me in, the jerks. Also, sometimes my character just isn't holding a guitar. See Ms. Roan above. I am not sure why.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/06/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-6]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finally, a AAA game that'll run on most gaming PCs</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> is just a couple of weeks away, and while the first few trailers definitely made it look like a <em>beautiful</em> game, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> trailer that debuted earlier this week, well, didn't. But, the way I see it, that's <em>excellent </em>news, especially for anyone on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-pc">budget gaming PC</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the RE Engine came to prominence starting with Resident Evil: Biohazard, Capcom has been impressing me with just how good it can make games look, without making them too demanding. Now, obviously, I haven't had the chance to test Resident Evil: Requiem performance yet myself, but just looking at both the system requirements and the Switch 2 trailer, it seems like Capcom is continuing this trend. </p><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Minimum PC Requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Recommended PC System requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hasn't revealed what resolution and settings either of these spec sheets are targeting, but even if that recommended build is just for 1080p Ultra at 60 fps, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia RTX 2060 Super</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review">Radeon RX 6600</a> are very attainable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">graphics cards.</a> That's not to mention only requiring a Core i7-8700 or Ryzen 5 5500 and 16GB of RAM, which is a very low bar to clear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Kind of Performance Can I Expect?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, because Capcom hasn't revealed any specific settings that the system requirements are targeting, I can't say for sure, but from my time testing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-the-almost-perfect-pc-port-we-all-needed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resident Evil Village for TechRadar</a> when it came out, I was able to get nearly 60 fps at 4K with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evga-rtx-3060-xc-black-review">RTX 3060</a> – and the 3060 is very much not a 4K graphics card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's important to note that the requirements for Requiem are a bit heavier than they were for Village. The biggest difference is that instead of asking for a Radeon RX 5700 or a GTX 1070 for Village, Requiem is asking for an RTX 2060 Super or a Radeon RX 6600. And while the performance gap between these graphics cards isn't huge on its own, the key difference is that Requiem is recommending a ray tracing-capable GPU – Village didn't. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes a lot of sense, given the visual quality of some of the trailers that have come out for the game, but it may leave some folks with older GPUs out in the cold. It's very likely that with an older non-RT GPU, the game will look a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2 footage. The bright side here, though, is that the GTX 1660 and Radeon RX 5500 XT sneak in the minimum specs, so you'll still be able to <em>play</em> the game, it just might not look too great. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Nintendo Switch 2 Equivalent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to highlight that the Nintendo Switch 2 is able to run Resident Evil: Requiem, even if it wouldn't <em>quite</em> meet the system requirements if it were a PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic-updated">The Tegra T239 SoC in the handheld is roughly the equivalent of a mobile RTX 3050</a> – which is weaker than the desktop-class GTX 1660 Capcom is requiring. I wouldn't get too caught up in this detail, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Primarily, that's because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a console and every single unit will be running the exact same hardware. That means when Capcom was porting Resident Evil: Requiem over to the Switch 2, it was able to fine-tune the build to the exact hardware, likely finding optimizations that wouldn't be there for the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, just going by the Switch 2 trailer earlier this week, it does seem like Capcom just barely managed to squeeze the game onto the handheld. But even if it is rough, I'm looking forward to seeing just how well it runs on the Nintendo console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>

<h2>Bad news for Valve in particular?</h2>
<p>On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.</p>
<p>Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.</p>
<p>F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”</p>

<p>The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.</p>
<p>That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.</p>
<p>“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”</p>

              <p><span>The Analogue 3D, a premium gaming console that’s fully compatible with Nintendo 64 games, just got</span> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-prototype"><span>a new line</span></a><span> of translucent colorways replicating five colors that were prototyped for the N64 but never released. The new Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions follow the limited release of Analogue’s Funtastic line, which replicated the N64’s Funtastic colorful translucent shells last December and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1pj8cgh/analogue_3d_limited_editions_what_sold_out_first/"><span>sold out</span></a><span> in less than two hours.</span></p> <p><span>The new limited edition line comes in five colors: Ghost, in sea glass (and the star of the show, in my opinion); Glacier, in milky white; Atomic Purple, in deep plum; Extreme Green, in, you guessed it, neon green; and Ocean, in cobalt.</span></p>   <p><span>“Five colors were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64,” the company writes. “Unreleased. Until now. They were real. They were manufactured. They were never released.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The company continues, “Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions finally release these lost colors as limited editions. History, finished. Decades later.”</span></p> <p><span>The unreleased N64 colors were </span><a href="https://consolevariations.com/blog/5-rumored-n64-prototypes-finally-discovered"><span>discovered</span></a><span> in 2019 by Console Variations, after a former Nintendo of Europe employee contacted the site. This little piece of lost video game history will be restored for the lucky customers who manage to get their hands on the new line before it sells out.</span></p> <p><span>The “highly limited” Analogue 3D: Prototype Edition consoles will be available for purchase on Monday, February 9 at 8 a.m. PST, and will ship within 48 hours. They will retail at $299.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In partnership with Analogue, 8BitDo is releasing a series of matching controllers for the new Prototype console line. The controllers will also be available for preorder on February 9 at 8am PST, though they won’t ship out until April. The controllers will be sold (separately) for $44.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition to the Analogue 3D, the console maker also sells the Analogue Pocket, a handheld compatible with games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (though it’s currently out of stock).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Analogue 3D is available in standard Black and White for $269.99, with matching 8BitDo controllers sold separately for $39.99.</span></p>

<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/echoes-of-elysium-preview-more-sandbox-than-survival-but-all-airship</link>
            <guid>1428622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the brainchild of Loric Games, a group of former Mythic Entertainment employees with a smattering of Bethesda developers mixed in. Having worked on titles such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/endurance-star-wars-old-republic" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b37f30ad-c8cb-4f8d-a44b-58b67d95bb81" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em></a> and <em>Dark Age of Camelot</em>, the studio has taken their extensive experience to head into uncharted territory with their debut title. Learn how Loric Games is approaching Early Access, and whether the sandbox survival airship RPG is for you with our <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> preview.</p><h2>Colorful, Carefree, and Calming</h2><p>Set as a sandbox RPG with survival elements thrown in, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> takes a different path than other games in the survival genre. You’ll find a bright blue sky, fluffy clouds, bright rooftops, and vivid flowers throughout the world’s floating islands. For the land of the dead, it is quite cheerful. Combined with the atmospheric music, the title can even be labeled calming.</p><p>The art is the main reason I became interested in the game. Survival games typically evoke an apocalyptic style with darker colors, dreariness, and an overbearing sense of despair. With a color scheme that deviates from the norm, it's easy for <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> to stand out in the crowded survival genre.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/using-a-harpoon-echoes-of-elysium.jpg?itok=J0UTlEBf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><p>While there are some survival aspects to the game, the title absolutely feels like a sandbox airship builder. You need to harvest rocks, trees, plant fiber, and fuel. You build your airship, which acts as a flying base. There’s food to forage and inventory to manage, but items don't spoil, and basic resources are easy to gather.</p><p>You don’t have any thirst or hunger, and your stamina mainly comes into play when gliding across the open expanse or fighting. Instead of having to track down your items, which you still have to do if you were away from your ship when you perished, you’ll be cursed with a debuff. When you die and respawn, you’ll need to find food that cures your new status or wait until the buff wears off.</p><p>I enjoyed gliding through the air, seeing the different islands, and finding new items to harvest. However, there’s not much else to do aside from that. The narrative, which is an element the team is still working on, is barely there, at best.</p><p>You get a story in the opening cutscene, are introduced to an NPC that aids you, and receive a quick tutorial. Once you capture your first Dry Dock, however, you can spend hours wandering the vast expanse without discovering another snippet of story. It’s even possible to skip part of the story if you find the boss’s den by accident.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/npc-lethe-narrative-echoes-of-elysium.jpg?itok=71ehVh16 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><p>During a preview presentation with Loric Games, it was admitted that the narrative doesn’t rank as high on the list of important items. Making airships into flying bases and nailing the associated mechanics are the focuses and stars of the game. The story will be coming, but it may not be as extensive or featured as prominently as some survival or RPG players will want.&nbsp;</p><p>As a survival title, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> misses the mark. There’s no pressure to actually survive. If you don’t die, you never need to eat or drink. There are no elements affecting your mood. Aside from falling out of the air and the scattering of enemies you can encounter, death is far from a concern.</p><p>As a sandbox builder, the title hits the main points, making it far more successful in that regard. You can build beautiful airships without having to worry about your skill as a builder, thanks to the rounded walls. Weight isn’t even an issue as long as you have enough propellers, allowing you to truly get creative with your build.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enemy-airship-echoes-of-alysium.jpg?itok=Sk5fhY0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enemy-airship-echoes-of-alysium.jpg?itok=ILm6cHwI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture></p><p>The biggest downfall of <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the somewhat grindy nature of the game when it comes to advanced resources, especially fuel, and the time it takes to travel from one island cluster to another. I often abandoned my airship to traverse with my glider. Even over large expanses, it was my preferred method of travel. While airships aren’t as slow as the ships in Skull &amp; Bones, it’s still a time investment to make your way around the map looking for resources.</p><p>On top of that, the game crashes, there can be glitches causing enemies to become invincible, and items can fall out of the sky, making them inaccessible. At first, I experienced quite a bit of lag that made playing almost impossible. That has vastly improved, but people with older machines may experience what feels like never ending lag.</p><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> has great bones and some great potential, it just needed more time in the oven. More narrative would add some structure to the experience. Additional resources, more concrete ways to find said resources, and more mechanics to craft items easily would ensure everyone who plays the title understands how to advance.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echoes-of-elysium-gliding_0.jpg?itok=8NSx7aLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><h2><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Even though there are issues, Loric Games’ outlook on Early Access assures fans they will continue working on the title. Taking a stance, a few years old, the studio will be listening to player feedback and furthering development through the EA phase, with the player base in mind. While this was how EA originally started for many games in the past, this hasn’t been the modus operandi for the majority of current EA releases. If you’re interested in the growth of the game and impacting how the world evolves, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> will be a great fit for you. If you’d rather have an almost completed title that’s pretty polished with lots of content for you to play through, you may want to wait until <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> fully launches.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong> was previewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 11 hours.

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Time To Start Building Your 4K Movie Collection]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-to-why-build-4k-uhd-blu-ray-physical-movie-collection-ps5-help-2000666185</link>
            <guid>1428619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In theory, movies are more accessible than ever before. You are literally reading this on a device that likely has access to a dozen or more streaming video apps and stores, like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Tubi, and Hulu. And yet, in reality, things are dire.<a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/disney-original-movies-series-content-removal-emea-1235813461/"> Movies can be pulled instantly from a service</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617">bad versions can be uploaded</a> and replace what existed before, and trying to manage multiple apps is expensive and annoying. It all sucks so much.</p> <p>So, I suggest that if you care about movies and want to avoid all of that nonsense and take back control of your media, you <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">cancel some services</a> and start investing in a physical movie collection. More specifically, I suggest you start building out a 4K UHD library of movies.</p>

 <h2>Why 4K UHD?</h2> <p>There are a few reasons why I think it’s a smart move to start investing in a 4K UHD collection of your favorite films. The biggest being that, at this point, it seems very unlikely that 4K UHD Blu-ray discs will ever be topped. That’s not to say 8K resolution TVs or content aren’t a thing. They are. But the reality is that physical media is no longer king.</p> <p>Digital streaming, even with its flaws, is the popular option. I can’t imagine any of the companies that would need to be invested in such a project actually working to create, promote, distribute, and support a new disc format for movies in the future. I don’t think we’ll get a widely sold, mass-produced, and studio-supported 8K disc or better.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/sorry-8k-tvs-have-flopped-2000716663">Another wrinkle is that in 2026, only Samsung is even making and selling consumer 8K TVs</a>. And many stores aren’t even selling physical movies anyway. Why would any company invest in a new superior physical format? No. 4K UHD is almost certainly the <a href="https://obsoletesony.substack.com/p/the-last-disc">last and best quality physical format</a> we’ll ever see. A bit depressing, but it does mean that you can invest in a big 4K UHD collection, safe in the knowledge that 10 years from now, 8K discs won’t pop up. Plus, 4k UHD is so damn good already that I’m not even convinced 8K movies are worth it.</p>

 <h2>What do I need to watch 4K movies?</h2> <p>If you own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X with a disc drive, you already own a damn fine 4K UHD player. And better yet, the cable that was included with your console, assuming you still have it, is going to be perfect. If you own an Xbox One S, that’ll work, too. And if you really want to, you can buy a 4K UHD player, but just know they get pricey fast. On the other hand, they mostly support Dolby Vision/HDR10+, which, for some reason, none of those consoles do when using physical media. Whatever you settle on, plug it into your 4K TV.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000009435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000009435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000009435">©Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>And yeah, you’ll need a 4K TV.&nbsp;If you don’t already own a 4K TV, it’s time to buy one. I mean, if you plan on collecting 4K UHD movies, you should invest in a nice TV to watch them on. Now, you can go wild and buy some incredibly big and expensive set, but there are also plenty of solid, cheaper 4K sets available on the market these days. I’d avoid going below $300 and would also stay away from TCL sets, as I’ve had nothing but trouble with them in the past, as have others. Still, even a cheapo 4K TV can provide a big improvement over an old 1080p set.</p>

 <p>Now, plug your player or console into your 4KTV with a good-quality HDMI cable and take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! Welcome to the future. Or well, 2015. Anyway, with that all out of the way, it is time for the fun part: Actually buying and watching movies!</p> <h2>What movies to buy first and where?</h2> <p>I always recommend that you buy some of your favorite movies, assuming they’ve made the leap to 4K UHD. (More on that later.) This is going to jumpstart your collection with stuff you like, and assuming you’ve watched your favorite films a few times, seeing them in 4K should provide a nice example of the leap in quality over streaming and 1080p Blu-Rays or even lower-quality DVDs.</p> <p>I’d also advise building a list of movies you want to buy and which ones you have bought. This will help a lot when you’re out and about and not near your collection, but spot a good deal on a movie. Check the list to see if you own it, and if not, buy it! It’ll also help you figure out which of your targets have made the leap to 4K UHD. Not every movie has, and while most of the bigger hits and cult classics have been brought over to the 4K format, there are still some odd exceptions and plenty of smaller films left out.</p>

 <p>As to where to buy your 4K UHDs, there are a few different options. Personally, my favorite place to get 4K movies is at a few of my local used game and movie stores. They tend to have good deals, and stumbling through a random assortment of movies not fed to you via an algorithm means you might discover some hidden gem you forgot about. eBay and Mercari are also good options, but just be careful, as always, when using these sites. And be prepared for some problems.</p> <p>Your big box stores, like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, might not be very useful in your hunt for new 4K UHD flicks. Not all of them have ditched physical movies and games, but some have, and plenty of others are drastically cutting down on how much they keep in stock at their brick-and-mortar stores. A smarter use of your time is to keep an eye out for deals on Amazon and follow Wario64 to find sales on 4K movies on sites like Gruv.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666518">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What about Blu-ray and DVD?</h2> <p>As I mentioned already, standard Blu-rays and DVDs don’t offer the same high resolution as 4K UHD. But, sadly, a lot of movies haven’t been converted to 4K UHD and some you may hope to acquire likely haven’t even received Blu-ray releases. In cases like that, you’re going to have to buy non-4K discs to enjoy those hard-to-find films. The good news is that even DVDs still look pretty good thanks to devices like the PS5, which upscale them slightly in a way that looks sharp but not artificial. So don’t feel weird buying a DVD. You’ll still get a nice picture out of it, assuming it was transferred well.</p> <p>And that’s it. I really do think more people should start building up physical movie collections, not just because it lets you take control of your media, but because scrolling through an app or a media server isn’t nearly as fun as flipping through a collection of physical boxes that contain movies. Grabbing one, loading it in, popping the case down, and watching something becomes a production, but in a good way. I find it helps me focus on the film and the act of watching it. I’m no longer passively hitting buttons to watch some random Netflix slop. I’m actively loading up a machine with a movie to enjoy. And I didn’t realize how much I missed that feeling.</p>

The latest season of the comedy talk show features the company's resident TTRPG expert, Brennan Lee Mulligan, chatting with a new suite of guests.</p><p>The new <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer provides more of what fans have come to expect from the Dropout crew. For those not aware, <em>Adventuring Academy</em> is a talk show where Brennan Lee Mulligan, the mind behind the platform's comedic actual play anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>, casually chats with a host about tabletop gaming.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These talks span a wide number of topics in regards to play for both new and experienced players. How do you handle a player character dying? How do you make a memorable character in your game? How much worldbuilding is too much? What steps can you take to make your players feel comfortable and safe when undertaking dark or intense scenarios?&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, these episodes can veer into comedic asides and passionate hot takes. That doesn't appear to have changed in the <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer. A guest declaring their dislike of Gandalf from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Brennan's slightly changed relationship with snacking and almonds. The edict of "mandatory queerness." It is all in line with Dropout's distinct irreverent brand.</p><p>The new season's guests are a mix of Dropout regulars and other creatives in the space. They include Vic Michaelis, Robbie Daymond, Oscar Montoya, Kimia Behpoornia, Aabria Iyengar, Emily Friedman, Mica Burton, Quinns Smith, and Jasper William Cartwright.</p><p>Overall, the line-up is consistent with past seasons. Prior guests have included Dropout talent like Jacob Wysocki, Sam Reich, Lou Wilson, and Ally Beardsley, as well as other professional tabletop creatives like Jasmine Bhullar, Deborah Ann Woll, Dave Walters, Marisha Ray, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's</a> own Matt Mercer.</p><p><em>Adventuring Academy </em>Season 7 premieres exclusively on Dropout on February 20th.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

In the interview, Horii is asked directly about the decision to recast certain characters in Kiwami from their original Japanese actors. His general response as to why he recast both Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro is that while it would "certainly be safer not to recast them and avoid online criticism," the studio "felt there was no use being afraid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horii goes on to say that they based their decision on who they most wanted to see perform. When asked directly about Kagawa playing Hamazaki, this is what Horii had to say:</p><blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Kagawa's casting as Hamazaki has been met with anger from Yakuza fans due to the actor having been <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused by multiple women</a> of <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault</a>, with one woman coming forward with what seems to be photographic evidence of the incident. In 2022, Kagawa <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/26/national/teruyuki-kagawa-groping-apology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to and apologized</a> for one of the incidents, but another of his accusers has <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she received no apology</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement of Kagawa's casting, Yakuza fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1ns20eq/they_need_to_remove_kagawa_from_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacted in anger on social media</a>, getting #REMOVEKAGAWA trending on multiple networks and creating a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> that at the time of this writing has nearly 10,000 signatures. Fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1o0j7l7/rgg_studio_suppressing_removekagawa_on_instagram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused RGG Studio</a> of suppressing the #REMOVEKAGAWA hashtag and deleting comments referencing the issue on its official Instagram page. And a number of them have pointed out that Sega has recast actors for offenses in the past - Pierre Taki was recast in Judgment back in 2019 after he was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/16/18409777/yakuza-judgment-new-actor-pierre-taki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for cocaine possesssion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, neither RGG Studio nor Sega has offered official comment on Kagawa's casting, nor the accusations - Horii's answer is the first statement that's been offered on the subject. However, Sega did <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=lJmH7GkM8lqeVkMR&amp;v=37mtmF0FrPI&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publish a trailer on its official YouTube</a> after the wave of criticism, which introduced the Japanese voice cast and opened on a longer clip of Hamazaki. IGN reached out to Sega for additional comment ahead of this story, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Aftermath remains a humble mom ‘n’ pop ‘n’ two cats operation, but we have grand ambitions. Slowly but surely, we grow more powerful every day. Thanks to your subscriber dollars, for which we’re eternally grateful, we’re now able to welcome two new writers into our regular rotation. You might have heard of them.</p><p>Former (until, you guessed it, layoffs) The Verge reporter Ash Parrish and prolific freelancer Joshua Rivera will soon be contributing to Aftermath on a regular basis! Ash is gonna be blogging one day per week, and Joshua is the monthly columnist <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>prophesied in our subscriber goals</u></a>. Both have written <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><u>excellent</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry/"><u>pieces</u></a> for Aftermath before, if you’d like a sample of what’s to come. We couldn’t be more excited to have them wandering the labyrinthine halls of our headquarters, by which I mean Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot emphasize enough that your subscriptions made this all possible, just as they did when we brought on Isaiah and Nicole as regular contributors last year. However, in the interest of disclosure, I will now share with you some less thrilling news: Our budget is pretty much tapped! We have <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>even grander long-term plans</u></a> – for example, hiring people full-time across multiple disciplines (and doing so at a wage that’s actually <em>livable</em>) – but we’ll need a pretty big boost to realize them.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where you come in: Consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/"><u>subscribing</u></a> if you haven’t already! Or tell your friends! At 5,000 paying subscribers, there is still ample room for this beautiful baby website to grow. If even a small fraction of the over-100,000 who follow us on social media or who’ve signed up for our free newsletters subscribed tomorrow, we’d be set. As is, we’re doing our best, and regardless of what the future brings, we can promise you that we’ll continue to do so. Further, we recognize that times are tough. Any support you can give – even if that means only an email address – is nonetheless appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to get to know Ash and Joshua better, you can listen to the latest episode of our weekly podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>. We discuss our shared histories at Kotaku, as well as current beats and interests (ask Ash about monster fucking). Then we delve into the media landscape at large, which can’t even go a single week without, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/"><u>The Washington Post laying off hundreds of people</u></a>. Next our light and breezy conversation takes us to Epstein Island thanks to alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>communications with the convicted sex criminal</u></a> from individuals in and around the world of games. Oh, we also talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><u>this week’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> and <em>Overwatch</em>, which is <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-this-man-were-all-so-tired/"><u>no longer <em>Overwatch 2</em></u></a>, but is also not <em>Overwatch 1</em>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Now I have been laid off for the first time in my adult life, and rather than freaking out knowing what the landscape is like – knowing that there’s a very good possibility I will never have a full-time job like the one I left again – I’m not really that worried about it. I’m fighting against things I can’t control, so I’m gonna do the things that are within my control. I know my work is good; people wouldn’t ask me for it if it wasn’t. So I have to find more of those people, and I think I’m gonna have to at least try to see if I have the strength to continue that. We’ll see.</p><p>It’s not good advice [to other writers who might be struggling]. You can’t eat that kind of advice. You can’t eat hope. Because it’s really cliche when people ask you “How do you do this when it’s all so bad?” and I’m like “You just have to keep doing it and hope.” That has to be your main fuel, because it’s not gonna come from anywhere else because it is so damn bleak. And if you don’t got it, you don’t got it. That’s fine. It sucks because that’s not really actionable. You just have to have it. But it is what it is. I hate saying that shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Next Aftermath subscriber goal: a machine that dispenses edible hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, what about you considering that you’ve been in the freelance realm for a while longer and have had to hop between those ice floes more regularly? What does that actually look like for you?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> It’s tough. When I left Polygon about a year and a half ago, it wasn’t quite starting over, but it felt a little bit like that. I was at Polygon three-ish, almost four years. Even that stretch of time, it felt like the scene had changed entirely. Even now, I feel like I’m figuring it out every day. I feel like quitting every day! It’s very much like Goku training at 100x gravity.</p><p>But I don’t know. For me it’s a sense of malcontent; I have this restless itch to say something – to figure things out and put out work that means something to people. That helps them understand the world and the things they engage with a little better. This feeling of being useful and being responsible with the platforms that I have in the time that I have them.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know how much longer that is. We’re seeing institutions collapse all around us, and we can only respond so quickly. Like, Aftermath has been growing to the point that y’all could bring me on for a monthly column, but to replace some of the outlets that we’re losing is gonna take a lot of work and time and investment. Every day I’m pretty conscious of the fact that I could be out of the game tomorrow, so what should I say today while I can? That’s kind of what I think about.</p><p>Which makes it sound like my work is a little more serious than it is. Sometimes I do find the value of being a fucking goober – and not letting them beat that out of me.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><div><p>Meet The Unconventional Publishers Trying To Unfuck The Games Industry</p><p>Developers turned publishers like Innersloth and Pocketpair are leveraging their success to help other indie games thrive.</p><p><span>Ash Parrish</span></p></div></a></figure>
