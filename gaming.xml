At the 2025 Game Developers Conference we were able to get a surprisingly frank assessment of Discord's product strategy from chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy and senior vice president of product Peter Sellis, who were remarkably upbeat about its monetization strategy. The pair painted a picture that placed Discord Nitro at the center of its offerings—one that hopefully won't need "enshittification" to benefit all parties.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-was-really-wearing-people-down-the-funding-challenges-that-followed-runaway-success-another-crab-s-treasure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It was really wearing people down:' The funding challenges that followed 'runaway success' Another Crab's Treasure</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Discord's had plenty of swings and misses in the last half-decade">Discord's had plenty of swings and misses in the last half-decade</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Discord has enjoyed explosive growth in the last decade (particularly during COVID-19-driven lockdowns that left players at home and in search of remote socialization), it hasn't had a perfect track record.

Translation: they couldn't break out of the video game bubble.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord doesn't want to call it a "retreat" of course.

That effort proved successful in the long run as the company watched more of its video game-playing userbase adopt mobile as their primary platform of choice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you're able to do that, suddenly Discord gets better for gaming, planning the night with your friends, and then afterwards—sharing the emotions and things like that," he added. "I think what what you'll hear us talk about sometimes is that Discord is the best place to talk and hang out before, during, and after a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A happier and more engaged mobile audience drove what Sellis and Vishnevskiy said was the core of Discord's monetization strategy: Discord Nitro. The monthly subscription service—which offers users advanced server tools, customization options, and larger file uploads—is the center of the company's plans to monetize its free-to-play app.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was slightly surprising, as other chat apps and social platforms have preferred to prioritize advertising over subscription services. But the pair said all the other features the company has rolled out, like the Discord Shop, are downstream of Nitro subscriptions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sellis said there are three predictors for if Discord users will subscribe to Nitro: the time they spend in Discord, the time they spend in voice chat, and the number of their friends have Nitro subscriptions. And it turns out those with Nitro subscriptions are the ones spending money in the Discord shop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's a very strong indicator that we're incentive-compatible with our users," said Sellis. So if the shop isn't meant to monetize free users, what is? That would be the quest system—an unusual form of advertising that an audience of players responds to better than the broader public.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How will Discord monetize if it goes public?">How will Discord monetize if it goes public?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we follow those threads to a possible future, Discord's post-IPO revenue strategy will likely be based on a carrot-and-stick approach to get more users on Nitro. The carrot would be to beefing up Nitro's offerings—possibly with incentives offered by game developers. The stick would be to eroding the features available to free Discord users and lock them behind a Nitro paywall (the aforementioned enshittification).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Sellis' theory holds up, then the company's best path forward is to nudge users to spend more time in voice chat, and to connect them with users subscribed to Nitro.

            <p>
As someone who's never played a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> game, seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year confused me simply because I didn't know it was a prequel. I generally prefer to play things in release order, but I understand why Square Enix did it that way around, and why they subsequently announced a double remake of the first two games. The third one launched just last November, leaving 1 and 2 with a vague 2025 release window. Well, until today, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared that the pair of remakes will be launching October 30th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While the first couple of Dragon Quests are technically available on modern platforms like the Nintendo Switch and mobile, you can't actually get them on PC. That means when the remakes launch it'll be the first time any of us in computer land can play them (officially speaking, of course). As mentioned I've not played any of them, just a series I've not gotten to yet, but neither of them are meant to be very long (hence the packaging of them together), so this doesn't seem like the worst way to tackle them.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I know this shouldn't be treated as the definitive way to play them, I just also don't always get along with the rough edges of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>. These'll likely have sanded off said edges, and that's just fine with me, I'll leave all that stat min-maxing to all you sickos out there.
</p>
<p>
There's also a version of the game coming aptly titled the Erdrick Trilogy which combines all three remakes together, if you've not picked the third one up yet. And if you own the full trilogy, you'll get a, uh, dog suit to wear in Dragon Quest 1, and a cat suit to wear in Dragon Quest 2. Sure!

With each new entry in the collection, <em>Mission: Impossible </em>filmmakers seem to make it their goal to put Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team in a maze of interconnected circumstances that seem, at the very least, improbable to get out of. But some of those missions really stood out more in their levels of complexity and impossibility.</p><p>This past week we’ve ranked everything from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-ethan-haircut-best-hair-long-mi2-1851782046?_gl=1*1fxp5wi*_ga*MTg1MDcxNDczNy4xNzQyMTU1ODM5*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNTgyMzkkbzEyNSRnMCR0MTc0ODM1ODIzOSRqNjAkbDAkaDAkZElMUXVjM05HaUdyQXR1dF9RSVM3RWpIR0hTTFJPM0RraEE.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-ethan-haircut-best-hair-long-mi2-1851782046?_gl=1*1fxp5wi*_ga*MTg1MDcxNDczNy4xNzQyMTU1ODM5*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgzNTgyMzkkbzEyNSRnMCR0MTc0ODM1ODIzOSRqNjAkbDAkaDAkZElMUXVjM05HaUdyQXR1dF9RSVM3RWpIR0hTTFJPM0RraEE.">Tom Cruise’s hair</a></span> in each movie to the franchise’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537">most irreplaceable characters</a></span>. In honor of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244"><em>The Final Reckoning</em></a></span><em> </em> dominating the Memorial Day Weekend box offices, we decided to take a different look at the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise by ranking the movies based on the impossibility of the mission. So, before you scream about Phillip Seymour Hoffman being a better villain than any other <em>Mission: Impossible </em>bad guy, or how Tom Cruise didn’t risk his life falling backwards off a helicopter for <em>Fallout </em>not to be the best movie ever, remember, it’s all about the mission, even if you don’t choose to accept it. </p></div></div><div><p>Not only is it the worst <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, it’s also the least impossible mission. Rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) wants to infect the world with the highly contagious Chimera virus, in order to profit from selling the cure. To stop him, Ethan Hunt has to break into Biocyte Pharmaceuticals’ high-security lab. Hunt recruits Ambrose’s ex, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), to seduce the villain into uncovering his plan, where she makes a heroic move, injecting herself with the last vial of Chimera to prevent its being unleashed.</p><p>That leaves Hunt with a 72-hour deadline, before the virus in Nordoff-Hall becomes irreversible, and while that does add a level of suspense, this was very much Mission: Difficult. Given the challenges described over the next seven entries, you’ll see what made this mission feel so pedestrian in hindsight.</p></div><div><p>To me, this is the best <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie ever. No other film in the franchise is as grounded with as many powerhouse performances as this action masterpiece. However, in terms of mission impossibility, it’s still pretty low. In the film, Hunt has 48 hours to retrieve a biotech weapon known as The Rabbit’s Foot and deliver it to Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) or risk this psychopath killing his wife. I’ll admit, Hunt sliding down the slanted glass roof of a skyscraper in order to kill all of the guards was badass, and parachuting into the Shanghai streets was insanely difficult. But, remember, this is an agent who has held his breath underwater for six minutes to swap security cards, jumped out of a plane on multiple occasions, and recently hopped into <em>two</em> planes in mid-air. The fact we don’t even see how he retrieved Rabbit’s Foot decreases the impossibility of the mission significantly. </p></div><div><p>Here’s the problem with <em>Dead Reckoning Part One</em>: The stakes of the film are cut in half. Sure, trying to stop a self-aware AI program known as The Entity that can digitally scrub people out of existence and trick a submarine into shooting itself is pretty impossible, especially when it has the capability of infiltrating Hunt’s communication systems to direct him away from his destination. However, the real stakes are reserved for the second part of the movie, <em>The Final Reckoning</em>.</p><p>The motorcycle jump off a cliff and onto a moving train, fist-fighting on the roof of said train, and almost dying numerous times is just to get a key are not nothing. But it’s still not really that impossible of a mission, especially considering what he’s done in the past.</p></div><div><p>The impossibility of <em>this </em>mission hinges heavily on one of the most iconic infiltration scenes in movie history. <em>Mission: Impossible</em> set the bar for the minimum acceptability of mission complexity, and most films have succeeded at exceeding it.</p><p>While trying to clear his name and unmask a mole in the IMF, Hunt has to silently descend from a ceiling into the most secure vault in America, inside CIA headquarters, to retrieve a list of secret agent identities. Since this first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> relied less on death-defying stunts and advanced CGI, the 1996 film leaned more into human-engineered suspense. The vault is pressure and temperature sensitive, so a droplet of sweat from Hunt’s forehead, running down his glasses, has to be caught  while he hangs from the ceiling to prevent it from hitting the ground. In fact, this mission should’ve failed five separate times. That’s a good sign an all-time impossible feat.</p></div><div><p>Increasing the impossibility of <em>Rogue</em>&nbsp;<em>Nation</em>’s mission is the fact this is the first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie where every facet of Hunt’s operation has been compromised from the beginning. Hunt and his crew have to prove the existence of The Syndicate, a mysterious super-network of former agents from various intelligence agencies, all of whom are presumed to be dead. And he has to do all this while being hunted by the CIA.</p><p>The U.S. government targeting Hunt is a frequent obstacle in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movies, but <em>Rogue Nation</em> is the first time the star also has to battle Solomon Lane (Sean Harris)—the smartest <em>Mission: Impossible </em>villain ever—and a team of agents nearly as skilled as he is. Unfortunately, the film’s big weakness—the global threat being more implied than imminent—knocks it down a few on the impossibility ranking.</p></div><div><p> In <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, Hunt and his team has to stop fanatical nuclear strategist Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has stolen nuclear launch codes and plans to trigger an annihilation that will force humanity into a rebirth. To prevent this, Hunt must scale the tallest building in the world, impersonate diplomats, survive a sandstorm chase and battle Hendricks inside a Russian missile control facility. Oh, and to make matters worse, the entire U.S. government has disavowed him and his team after Hendricks framed them of blowing up the fucking Kremlin in one of the most shocking moments in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> history.</p><p>The mission becomes even more impossible when Hendricks actually launches the missile towards San Francisco, and quickly becomes a ridiculous race down a cylindrical car garage to make a last-second effort to disable the bomb seconds before it makes impact. Given how close this came to disaster, the shifting nature of the goal, and the fact Hunt climbs the Burj Khalifa, this is one of the higher impossibility levels the franchise ha</p></div><div><p>Whenever Hunt can’t save the world by himself, the added variables increases the mission impossibility. In <em>Fallout</em>, Hunt and the IMF have to prevent a global nuclear catastrophe by disabling two synchronized nuclear bombs intended to poison one third of the world’s water supply. This is all made much more complicated, since if you disable one bomb too early, the other one explodes. One more wrinkle: Disabling both of them is only possible after destroying a remote detonator. And all of this has to be done within 15 minutes, while Hunt is twirling around in a helicopter fight, racing to secure said detonator. That doesn’t even factor in how he jumped out a plane in order to save an unconscious August Walker (Henry Cavill) mid-air, a double-agent implanted in Hunt’s operation to monitor him for the U.S. government, who is also sabotaging his mission for psychopath Solomon Lane. </p><p>Trusting his right-hand men Benji (Simon Pegg) and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283">Luther</a></span> (Ving Rhames) to guide him through a prison or off a cliff onto a moving train is one thing, but trusting them—along with his barely-trained wife Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan)—to disarm a bomb while he’s hundreds of miles away in the air is a different level. With all of that factored in, there really is only one other movie with a more impossible mission. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hunt and the IMF’s main obstacle in every <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie is usually time, but <em>The Final Reckoning </em>ramps this up to an all new level of anxiety. Our intrepid crew has to stop the evil AI The Entity from launching every country’s nuclear missiles, and to do this they need to let it enter a secure database, in order to trap it on a 5D hard drive. The catch? Grace (Hayley Atwell) has to snatch the hard drive the millisecond The Entity enters.</p><p>If she snatches it a millisecond too early, The Entity remains connected to cyberspace and the missiles launch. If she does it a millisecond too late, The Entity safely enters the secured location and the missiles launch. On top of that, Hunt has to insert poison pill malware in the source code module in order to trick The Entity  into thinking it’s in the secured database. In the blink of an eye, the world could be reduced to ashes.</p><p>The entire world was going to be destroyed if one woman wasn’t quick enough to snatch a hard drive with seemingly impossible precision. And this is while battling an AI program that was literally altering reality and recruiting people inches away from the President of the United States. Without question, the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise ended with its most impossible mission.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will launch in June. <span id="more-967326"></span></p><p><em>VOIN</em> is currently in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464530/VOIN/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Nikita Sozidar’s latest developer log:</p><h2><span>“Permafrost” Developer Log</span></h2><p><iframe title="VOIN - &quot;Permafrost&quot; Update Developer Log" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VTQo0c1y5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone, I’m Nikita, and for the past year-and-a-half, I’ve been <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>. Take a look.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>VOIN</em> is a first-person <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a> with <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> elements set in <a title="Genres > Open-World [635 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>-like levels. The game is about you being an unstoppable force of nature that wields metal as it weapon. The world is broken and you are its reckoning.</p><p><strong>Items and Affixes</strong></p><p>You kill monsters, you get loot, which is the game’s bread and butter. And instead of affixes that plainly increase random stats, I decided to focus only on impactful stuff that actually changes the way you play. For example, you might find a hammer called Bell Ringer, which summons ghostly bells that—when hit—damages everyone around.</p><p>Or another example, which I also like a lot—a really powerful scythe that literally tears reality as you swing leaving scars that emanate freezing aura—or should I say a cool aura. No I shouldn’t say that. But guess what? You can also combine those two items into one. Find the symbiosis station at the hub, read the instructions carefully—please—and boom you have dual wakizashis that poison everyone and summon fire tornadoes—that’s a thing. But enough of that let’s get to the next exciting thing.</p><p><strong>The World</strong></p><p>In the last major update, Thunderborn, I added a huge dungeon underneath the Cathedral of Veiled Lament. Now, though, I’m working on the game’s next major update called Permafrost. It features a new absolutely massive new location the Athenium of Thousand Names. Snow-covered mountains, ice giants, perpetual blizzards—this place does not offer a warm welcome, not at all.</p><p>One of the other major features of this update is proper character progression—finally! Journey to the Hall of Reflection and find the new tree of talents (yes, your talent tree is an actual tree). And not only that, while exploring you’ll be finding Soul Fruits, which you can attach to the tree and gain various bonuses—for example, the ability to sprint. And you can already play the talent tree update—right now.</p><p>Anyway the game is shaping up great and there are a lot more super exciting things coming. For example, a completely new character, completely new weapon types—spears daggers and more—and even quests.</p><p>All right guys, that’s it for me. Thank you very much and see you next time.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sign-ups are available now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>. <span id="more-967279"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via tinyBuild:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to world where danger lurks around every corner, yet one that always rewards curiosity and courage.</p><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is an immersive third-person open-world RPG created by a passionate team that values the essence of classic old-school RPGs and modern designs. Explore the lands of a once-prosperous island, hone your combat skills, and survive in the unforgiving realm of the Kingdom of the Seven.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Rewarding World Exploration</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>‘s world is full of hidden treasures, underwater caves, side quests and bosses, and valuable loot. Some of these can be found with a treasure map, while others with pure luck. The game has no marker system, and quests won’t lead you by the hand. Rediscover the joy of exploration and let curiosity be your guide; the world promises rich rewards for those who dare to uncover its secrets.</li><li><strong>Deep Character Progression and World Evolution</strong> – Build your characters as you like with three different skill branches: <a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, Craftsmanship and War. Allocate your character’s attribute points and unlock passive bonuses by exploring the world. The social system makes your progression even more noticeable: As the hero’s skills grow, the world around him reacts differently. If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin, by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet.</li><li><strong>Rich Storytelling</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is set in the low-fantasy cruel medieval world. Make your path from abandoned lowlife to a marshal of fortunes, choose your side and forge alliances on your journey to discover the truth of who you really are.</li><li><strong>Methodical <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,640 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a> Combat</strong> – The combat system in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> allows players to use three different combat stances with unique combat styles for different weapons. You are not a Legendary powerful Hero by default in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>. You need to learn the ropes of becoming one! Learn to stand up for yourself by timing your attacks, using environments, and active skills. Invest in the War branch to become more skilled not just in numbers: attacks become more accurate and stronger, and you’ll learn more tricks. For example, you’ll be able to throw bottles from the ground to stun your opponents!</li><li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere</strong> – Players are encouraged to slow down and fully embrace the world around them. The richly detailed environment comes alive with a dynamic day-night cycle, shifting weather, and natural elements like wind that sways the trees. Ambient sounds—from the soft rustle of leaves to distant birdsong—enhance the immersion, while NPCs follow their own daily routines, adding to the sense of a living, breathing world. The result is an experience that wraps players in a comforting, tranquil atmosphere, inviting them to linger and explore at their own pace.</li><li><strong>When Classic Meets Modern</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is a game for everyone from hardcore RPG fans to casual players. It is inspired by classic old-school RPGs and combines the convenience of modern gaming while paying homage to the legendary classic <a title="Genres > RPG [17,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing games</a>. There are no quest markers or enemy auto-levelling, but there’s modern user interface, environment markers, tutorials, and much more.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>World Overview Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - World Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qICLoFcoSdo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this month, NetherRealm Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-gets-the-definitive-edition-treatment-and-its-out-now/1100-6531544/" data-ref-id="1100-6531544">Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition</a>, a digital-only package that includes the base game, the Khaos Reigns DLC expansion, and two rounds of fighter packs. Players took it as a sign that MK1 wouldn't be getting any more updates, and bombarded NetherRealm for continued DLC support. Now, NetherRealm has confirmed that Mortal Kombat 1's reign is coming to a close.</p><p>"We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1," noted the game's official account on <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "And, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020818363924598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later message</a>, NetherRealm acknowledged that fans may be disappointed by the news, before adding that the devs need "to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can."</p><p>NetherRealm hasn't officially announced which game is coming next from the studio, but the most likely choice would be Mortal Kombat 2. DC fighting game fans would probably also like to see NeatherRealm get around to Injustice 3, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/" data-ref-id="1900-6416680">Injustice 2</a> was released eight years ago without getting a proper sequel.</p><p>Earlier this year, NetherRealm added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-adds-a-secret-fight-against-pink-floyd-kind-of/1100-6528939/" data-ref-id="1100-6528939">a pink ninja named Floyd</a> as a hidden battle in Mortal Kombat 1, which may be the final piece of bonus content in the game. Warner Bros. has also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-is-a-list-material-in-new-images/1100-6530158/" data-ref-id="1100-6530158">new images from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie</a>, which will hit theaters on October 24.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Most notably, both the Light and Heavy Bowguns are receiving some substantial buffs, as are the Hammer and Hunting Horn. For the bowguns, various ammo types are seeing a damage increase, as well as an increase to the number of hits when using Dragon Ammo. There are other smaller adjustments too, with the only nerf to come out of the Bowgun changes being a decrease to Elemental Ammo damage.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Hammer and Hunting Horn, both blunt weapons are seeing some major improvements. Hammer is having the "overall" power of its attacks increased, as well as improvements to responsiveness when charging an attack. The hitbox has also been increased for Upswing and sneak attacks. Hunting Horn has seen the damage of some of its key attacks (Echo Bubble, Performance, and Focus Strike: Reverb) increased, as well as a "significant" increase to Encore damage. Capcom has also toned down the visual effects of Echo Bubbles in order to help improve visibility during hunts.</p><p dir="ltr">Those caught up in Monster Hunter Wilds' endgame grind will find more to do soon, as the latest patch makes it so higher-difficulty quests should now appear more frequently as a player's Hunter Rank increases. As detailed in the patch notes, that translates to increased spawn rates for quests with multiple monsters and increased Tempered monster spawn rates. As for monster balance changes, the main change is that monsters resistant to paralysis with now gain more resistance to the ailment each time it's triggered on them, which should make it harder to keep monsters locked down.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the more frequent Tempered monster spawns are five additional Tempered monsters for players to hunt. At Hunter Rank 41 and higher, players can encounter eight star versions of Tempered Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad.</p><p dir="ltr">Fashion Hunters will have more to do as well, with new Hunter and Palico armor sets, outfits for Alma, and additional gestures, pendants, and stickers. Other additions in the patch include the addition of Mandarin Chinese as a language option, the ability to use the rest feature while in tents in Suja and the Grand Hub, and a whole lot of bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds has proven to be a huge success for Capcom. It's currently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025 so far</a>, having sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/" data-ref-id="1100-6530490">10 million copies in its first month</a>, and has helped cement Monster Hunter as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/" data-ref-id="2900-6294">Capcom's best-selling game franchises</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds Patch 1.011.00.00 Notes</h2><h3>Major Additions and Changes</h3><ul><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration is now available.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration side missions have been added.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration Arena Quests have been added.</li><li>– Akuma has been added as an NPC.</li><li>– Akuma-only actions have been added, which can also deal damage to monsters.</li><li>– Five more Tempered Monsters (8★) have been added to the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus.1199667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/playstation-days-of-play-2025-brings-discounts-on-ps5-consoles-accessories-ps-plus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has revealed the Days of Play 2025 promotion, running from 28th May through 11th June to coincide with Summer Games Fest, and bringing discounts for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> consoles, accessories, games, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a>.</p>
<p>This includes some significant sale pricing on PlayStation 5 consoles. In the US and Canada, the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 bundle is starting at $399.99 USD / $509.99 CAD for the digital edition, saving up to $120 if bought separately. Meanwhile, standalone consoles in Europe and Asia will also be on sale, starting at €399.99 / £339.99 / ¥65,980 for the digital edition. There will also be a $50 USD discount on the PS5 Pro.</p>


<p>That’s potentially a good set of savings, bringing the price of the digital consoles down significantly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">below what the MSRP was</a> prior to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">the price hikes in April this year</a>. I’m not sure why Sony aren’t saying the price of disk drive consoles, outside of “starting from” giving lower numbers.</p>
<p>There will also be offers for PS5 accessories and games, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 USD off PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</li>
<li>$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li>
<li>$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off Access controller</li>
<li>$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li>
</ul>
<p>Discounts will also be rolling out through the PlayStation Store on hundreds of games, and there’s also some savings to be had on PlayStation Plus. New subscribers can save up to 33% on a 12-month membership, though this will depend on region and tier – PS Plus Essential typically only has a 20% discount in these deals now, though Sony has not yet stated what the discount will be, sticking with the “up to” descriptor.&nbsp;If you upgrade from PS Plus Essential or Extra to PS Plus Premium, then you will also save 33%.</p>

<p>Sony’s revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/">PS Plus Monthly Games for June</a>, with a bonus fourth title, the Destiny 2: The Final Shape year-long expansion.</p>
<p>For PS Plus Extra, games added through the next fortnight include Another Crab’s Treasure (PS5), Skull and Bones (PS5), Destiny 2: Legacy Collection (PS5, PS4) and Grand Theft Auto III (PS4, PS5). Meanwhile, Myst and Riven are added to the PS Plus Premium Classics library.&nbsp;There’s also PS Plus trials for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive announced that its debut smash-hit RPG, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has hit <strong>3.3 million copies sold</strong>, 33 days after the game launched.</p>
<p>"<em>We couldn't make that up</em>," a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892">post on X</a> from the game's official account reads. "<em>Another entry on the long list of surreal moments that your support has made real. Thank you all.</em>"</p>
<p>It's the latest sign that the stars definitely aligned to help Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 reach the audience of players looking for RPG's like Clair Obscur. Even the fact that the week it launched, it did so days after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered arrived, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">ended up helping out Clair Obscur instead of overshadowing it</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond not getting overlooked by an Oblivion remaster, the other major aspect of this milestone is the fact that, like Oblivion Remastered, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched into Xbox Game Pass, so millions of players didn't necessarily need to buy it to check it out. All in all, for a small team like Sandfall Interactive, they couldn't have asked for a better launch for their debut game.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur</a>, he had nothing but praise for it, writing:</p>
<p>"<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive's first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself</em>."</p>

But in Japan, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/2025/250527.html">announced a new partnership</a> with Japanese third-party retail sites to combat fraudulent Switch 2 listings.</p><p>Mercari, Yahoo Auctions and Yahoo Flea Market, and Rakuten Rakuma are the participating websites that will, according to a machine translation of Nintendo’s announcement, “proactively remove listings” and establish “a collaborative system for sharing information.” Nintendo says only “fraudulent listings” that violated the sites’ terms of service agreement would be targeted for removal.</p><p>In <a href="https://support.yahoo-net.jp/PccAuctions/s/article/H000014527">a translated statement on Yahoo Japan’s website</a>, the retailer stated that there will be a probationary period for the Switch 2 starting June 5th in which Yahoo Japan will remove listings for the console or suspending the accounts selling them. According to Yahoo Japan, it will revise the probationary period as necessary.</p><p>Scalpers are the bane of any console launch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/25/23137789/aio-buying-bots-ps5-xbox-series-x-console-shortage">Bots flood online buying queues</a> to snap up units before real humans can click “Add to Cart.” Bot users then take advantage of consumer FOMO by listing consoles for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, other sellers use deception to trick people into buying what they think is a console but is actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ebay-issues-warning-to-scammers-selling-photos-of-ps5s">a picture of a box</a> or some other worthless item. (Anti-scalpers would later use <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3lnjzg2iswk2w">a version of this practice</a> for the Switch 2.)</p><p>Hopefully, Nintendo’s plan with third-party sites in Japan works well enough to expand it to other regions.</p><div><p>To cut down on scalpers during the Switch 2 preorder window, Nintendo sent out preorder invitations to users with over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">50 hours of gameplay and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It's nice when you have some extra time to do things that aren't that important but would make you 0.0001% happier knowing they are no longer around. Take my PC desktop, for example. In backing up my old <em>VICE</em> email, it built a bunch of weird files on my desktop and made it cluttered. I like a clean desktop. Put that shit into folders, you know? But I only use my PC desktop to stream games, having moved into a Mac for most of my writing and admin work. But I still hate that cluttered desktop!!!! Every time I turn on the PC!!! But given that I'm almost immediately booting into a game, does it matter? No. Does it mater 0.0001%? Yes, yes it does, and when I had a few hours to myself on Friday ahead of family stuff, I finally turned on the PC, figured out why the weird files were there, and got rid of them. I now have a clean PC desktop. It is inconsequential, but I am genuinely 0.0001% happier.</p><p>-pk, who is spooked about seeing <em>Bring Her Back </em>later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MEMORIAL DAY: </strong>A day off where I realized part of my deck is falling apart, thanks to an animal. Is it <em>good</em> if a squirrel finds a way to rip through part of a post and make it their home? It's not a terribly fun way to spend the final hours of a day off, scrambling to send photos to contractors and wondering "how much is this gonna cost?" Something to chat about on a future <em>HOA</em>, I guess.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Hopshot</em> – The last stream did not go well. A bad jump sent me spiraling, forcing the kindest version of a rage quit, where I realized I just did not have the energy to center myself back into place. Sorry. I think we're going to give this <em>one</em> last go before I give <em>Hopshot</em> a break? I do want to finish it, and I promise I will finish it on camera, but there might be logic to doing one of two things: 1) playing for an hourish once per day, letting me walk away without feeling fully defeated or 2) coming back in a month.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Rob is out, but Rob is now back. </li><li><strong>VIDEO: </strong>An opportunity came up that'll make sense when the video goes live. Should be fun, though. It's not a way we usually cover a video game, but Chia is out on Friday, forcing us to be a little more creative on pulling this one off.</li><li><strong>LETTER SERIES:</strong> Once again, topic TBD. Any ideas?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

In this short, but sweet, adventure, players control a chicken named Chick and his sidekick Nugget as they set out on an adventure to rescue stolen eggs. It’s a simple but cute premise for a game, and it should provide a worthwhile experience for fans of platformers and cozier games. If you’re wondering just how many hours you’ll be spending with Chick and Nugget, let’s dig into how long it takes to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196215,196923" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h292062"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>?</h2><p><strong><em>PaperKlay</em> is a fairly brief little game that should take most players around 6 hours to see through to its conclusion</strong>. Given its launch price of only $15, though, that ends up feeling like a pretty decent amount of content for platforming enthusiasts to sink their teeth into. </p><p>Like many other games in the genre, <em>PaperKlay</em> is also a collect-a-thon with plenty of things to seek out in each of its levels.</p><p>If you want to collect every button, orb, and egg in <em>PaperKlay</em>, you will almost certainly need to play through various levels multiple times. And a few orbs, in particular, require you to have a lot of environmental awareness. You’ll need to engage in puzzles (such as flipping parts of the level to line up platforms), find items in the world to return to their owners, or even rapidly track down red orbs before a timer runs out.</p><p><strong>Doing everything in <em>PaperKlay</em> can certainly increase your playtime by a few additional hours, possibly even double the amount of time you’d spend if you just played through it once</strong>. Collectibles can be used to upgrade your abilities, so you might find return trips to previous levels a bit speedier once your health, glider, and jumping abilities are all improved. You’re also likely to earn most of the game’s achievements by the time you play through each level a few times. </p><p>All in all, it’s worth investing the time in this adorable platformer, even if the journey is over quicker than we may wish. Here’s to hoping WhyKev is eyeballing some DLC for the future so that we can all spend a bit more time with Chick and Nugget.</p><p><em>PaperKlay</em> is available now on Windows PCs, with a Nintendo Switch version on the way at an unspecified date in the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What contributed to the game's big success? No doubt a number of factors, including its lower price and smaller scope, according to publisher Kepler Interactive.</p><p>Kepler's Matthew Handrahan told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Expedition 33 "really respects the player's time;" it's not a game that offers size for the sake of size. "It gives them plenty to do, and it gives them plenty of satisfaction, but it isn't arbitrarily 500 hours of gameplay," he said. "It's impactful because it's scoped correctly. […] It doesn't have any sense of bloat or extraneous things that are put there just to make it larger and larger and larger."</p>

<p>Handrahan went on to say he believes "brevity should be more of a virtue in gaming," adding that "something can be better by being shorter."</p><p>What he's saying sounds similar to what 2K said about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, which is a $50 linear game that doesn't require a "massive time commitment." 2K has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">believes there is an audience for just such a game</a>, and Expedition 33's sales results thus far may lend credence to that possibility.</p><p>Also in the interview, Handrahan reacted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-80-games-are-a-steal-based-on-what-they-offer-former-playstation-exec-says/1100-6531628/" data-ref-id="1100-6531628">rising prices in gaming</a>, saying Expedition 33's $50 price point might have helped the game reach more people. As the price of AAA games goes up and up, it creates an opportunity for "sensibly scoped games" in the $40-$50 range, he said.</p><p>"I don't think anyone that played Expedition 33 would think they didn't get their money's worth out of that," he said. When the $50 price was announced, the company got backlash online, Sandfall COO and producer François Meurisse said, because people feared Expedition 33 might be a 12-hour game with "unfinished content."</p><p><b>"</b>But in the end we stuck with the price, we doubled down on it, [and] we provided some context about the fact that it wasn't a AAA," the developer said. "In the end, it was a win-win situation, because it was a way to attract more players towards the game, to have good player satisfaction about their buying [decision], and it could actually end up doing more sales. So maybe players' perception can change a bit about that kind of price [point]."</p><p>Expedition 33 also launched into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> library--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">the same week as Oblivion Remastered</a>--and some theorized that this might have negatively impacted the number of copies sold outright. Kepler rejected that idea, though, saying launching near Oblivion Remastered didn't seem to hurt "at all."</p><p>Other developers have admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925">launching into Game Pass might cannibalize game sales</a>, but any potential losses could be mitigated by a payment from Microsoft to launch on Game Pass. The business specifics of any such deal between Microsoft and Kepler for Expedition 33 are unknown.</p><p>Given the big success of Expedition 33 thus far, many are wondering if Sandfall will release any DLC or expansions for the game, but nothing has been announced. The studio is, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">gearing up for its next game.</a></p>

                <p>Uncapped Games has announced that it is ceasing development on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battle-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-631828">Battle Aces</a>, a fast-paced real-time strategy (RTS) spearheaded by a former StarCraft 2 developer.</p><p>This decision was announced on <a href="https://www.playbattleaces.com/news/development-of-battle-aces-has-ended" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle Aces' website</a>. The only real reasoning Uncapped Games provided for the cancellation was that "the returns from early testing were not strong enough to support continued development." In the announcement, Uncapped Games went on to thank the community. "We’ll always be proud of what we built, and the community that formed around Battle Aces," the studio's statement explains. "While the game’s journey ends here, the connections, ideas, and memories we have shared will remain with us forever."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VRoyKP9r8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c0VRoyKP9r8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battle Aces was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">announced at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> by Uncapped Games, a subsidiary of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios. Its game director was David Kim, a designer who worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-30719">StarCraft 2</a> at Blizzard Entertainment, and wanted to make an RTS that stripped back much of the complexity and unit micromanagement common in the genre. Battle Aces matches were short, as players could quickly spawn units and issue simple commands to outflank their enemy and ultimately destroy their base.</p><p>Uncapped Games had held several betas following the announcement of Battle Aces. Invited players had opportunities to try it out in June 2024, November 2024, and April of this year. Although I enjoyed what I played in those betas, after all that public-facing testing, it appears that those behind Battle Aces ultimately determined that it would not be successful enough to launch. For now, there is currently no word on whether Battle Aces' cancellation will result in layoffs at Uncapped Games.</p><p>Those looking for new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">RTS games</a> to carry on StarCraft's legacy will now have to check out the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stormgate/" data-ref-id="5000-565942">Stormgate</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mechabellum/" data-ref-id="5000-511161">Mechabellum</a>, which are backed by former Blizzard developers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/the-june-2025-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-jet-set-radios-spiritual-successor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony is kicking off the Days of Play promotion for June, and as part of that, they’ve announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> Monthly Games. There’s four games this time, including the spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, with the added freebie being Destiny 2: The Final Shape, which is actually available from tomorrow!</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus June 2025 games?</span></p>


<p>Three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 3rd June and they will be available until 30th June. That fourth game, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, will be available from tomorrow, 28th May.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NBA 2K25</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Alone in the Dark (2024)</strong> | PS5 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available June 3)</li>
<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong> | PS5, PS4 (available May 28)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go in reverse order. <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></strong> is the culmination of a ten year epic story woven by Bungie… though it’s not the end of the game, with more expansions and content still coming to the online looter shooter. Still, for many, The Final Shape was a fitting end to the tale and characters. In our review, Tuff said, “The Final Shape is Destiny 2 back to its best for its grand narrative finale. It’s the ultimate space wizards with a machine gun fantasy combined with emotional story beats and characters you truly care for. Despite all the odds, Bungie has crafted the perfect endgame.”</p>


<p>We don’t actually have a review of <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberpunk</strong>, but the 2023 game is a spiritual successor to the coolest Dreamcast game out there, Jet Set Radio. Coming from Team Reptile, you’re kitted out with bootpacks and set into the streets to dance, graffiti, collect beats, and combo tricks together in New Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Trading beats and streets for squeaks and courts, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/nba-2k25-review/"><strong>NBA 2K25</strong></a> “is both a great and a frustrating experience,” Aran said. “Beneath the layers of VC and the slow grind is a very good basketball game. The presentation is top notch and MyGM is the best mode to play to get the full NBA experience. MyCareer can be fun and it is a shame it is so bogged down where players have to choose to grind very slowly to improve, or to spend quite a bit of additional money to improve their players.”</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a></strong> reboot from Pieces Interactive, which Jim said, “While it’s great to witness the return of survival horror royalty, Alone in the Dark haphazardly follows modern genre trends where it once invented them. While it mostly succeeds at drawing players into a Lovecraftian mystery, it’s hard to ignore the underbaked action elements used to patch these story beats together.”</p>
<h2>Can you still get the May 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 2nd June to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> | PS5</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/balatro">Balatro</a> | PS5, PS4</strong></li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen.1199616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-avowed-and-more-add-support-for-nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/f1-25-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-ray-reconstruction-path-tracing/">announced</a> the latest batch of games that have added support for its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen and DLSS Super Resolution technology, including F1 25, which launches today for those with paid early access, and with support for DLSS 4.</p>
<p>Seven games in total officially added support for DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation: F1 25, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-titans-qa-rockfish-talks-about-the-upcoming-dlc-and-more/">Everspace 2</a>, Storror Parkour Pro, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-complete-ray-tracing-8k/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, Torque Drift 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/">Wreckfest 2</a>. Two more games added support for DLSS Super Resolution: <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-is-out-now-on-pc-and-mobile/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>.</p>
<p>Players jumping into F1 25 today or in a few days when it launches for everyone who didn't pay to play a few days early will also be able to take advantage of DLSS Ray Reconstruction for a more stable gameplay experience without losing the graphical impact that comes with ray-tracing, and those who have one of the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards from NVIDIA will be able to take full advantage of DLSS 4.</p>
<p>And just in time for HBO's The Last of Us concluding its second season, players can jump into The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC with DLSS 4 support, which was missed when we checked it out for its PC launch at the beginning of last month. Though to the credit of Naughty Dog and Nixxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo still found it to be a smooth experience</a> at launch. Now with DLSS 4 support, it should be even smoother for players looking to compare and contrast how the story is portrayed in HBO's premiere TV version of it versus Naughty Dog's original game.</p>
<p>The seven games announced today now join the more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/">125 games and applications</a> that support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation technology, a milestone that NVIDIA recently confirmed.</p>

        <p>Did they even have roguelikes back then?</p>

            <p>
A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> update is here, version 1.0.5, with this one mostly having a focus on parkour improvements. There are, however, a couple of collaborations that have arrived in the game too, one with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and another with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>. We'll get to those in a second, for now let's take a look at those parkour tweaks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, you can jump now! Well, you can do a vertical jump to be specific, letting both Naoe and Yusuke hop in an upwards direction to grab ledges or overhangs within reach. There's also now a sprint toggle lock option, meaning as long as you're moving, you won't stop sprinting if you use the parkour up or down options. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Some enhanced back and side ejects have been added in too, specifically the distance and height of them, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> noting that foot landings will be favoured over hand landings. Naoe specifically will have some new animations when she does a height-gaining side eject.
</p>
<p>
You'll find a good few new photo mode features alongside all of this, with things like the ability to change the time of day, playing music while you're tweaking your shots, the ability to save custom filters, and for PC specifically, a fullscreen option.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those collabs. The first is a Dead by Daylight event, which Ubisoft describes as follows: "As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat…" You can start this new quest from your hideout once you've unlocked Yasuke, and once you've beaten it you'll get a trinket and banner.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the Balatro collab. That damn card game really has it's hooks in all of us, 'ey? This one is just a new trinket for Naoe and amulet for Yasuke called Winning Hand. These both offer a legendary perk that "gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders." How do you get these new items? "You will need to work together to figure out how to get it!" says Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
There's a bunch of other general fixes with this update to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game too, but you can read about all of those over on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/3hJ2jNQEK4AXQGMg79pm2h">patch notes</a>.

For comparison, the original <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> earned $145 million total domestically across its nearly four-month run in theaters back in the summer of 2002. The live-action remake’s worldwide box office haul over Memorial Weekend is an astounding $341 million. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=bo_se_r_2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=bo_se_r_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The OG film brought in less than $275 million globally during its initial run</a></span>. </p><p>So yeah, the new <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is a blockbuster hit.
