<p>This time, it's an Indie World, and will be taking place on <strong>7th August at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. The showcase will be roughly 15 minutes long and will be show in all of the usual spots.</p>

<p>Folks, we've <em>just</em> had a Partner Showcase — which some found disappointing. There might be some rather lovely surprises in store here, though. Let's wait and see!</p>

			<p>THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has already sold more than 300K units in less than three days since its early access debut on PC, where the game is available via Steam or the Epic Games Store. So far, user reviews submitted on Steam are positive, with 84% of the nearly 6K reviews entered so far giving the game a thumbs up. </p>



<p>According to Grimlore Games, this version of Titan Quest II includes around 15 hours of content. The full version is expected to be available in around a year; however, once the game gets to version 1.0, the price will be raised to $49.99 / €49.99. Those who wish to join the early access can do so at a discounted price of $29.99 / €29.99, and from now through August 8, there is another 20% discount to bring the price down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>



<p>Grimlore plans to add new masteries, new content, and new world segments, stories, and quests, as well as new features to enhance the game’s longevity, such as crafting. These new features and content will be released through early access as soon as they are ready. Smaller updates, such as bug fixes, balancing, and minor polish updates, are expected to go live monthly, though they can be skipped if nothing major is needed. Major updates, adding significant new features, mechanics, and/or content, will be released roughly every three months. The studio will also introduce translations to the game during the early access period, as currently, there's only English.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As usual with early access games, Titan Quest II will only launch on consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X once that phase is over and version 1.0 is ready to deploy on PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-indie-world-august-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-indie-world-showcase-announced-for-thursday.1262361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct Indie World show will be airing later this week, bringing new information about indie games heading to both of the Japanese gaming giant's currently-active platforms.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Indie World showcase will air on Thursday at 6am Pacific (that's 9am Eastern and around 2pm BST). It's set to bring "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</p>

<p>The Indie World Direct follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">last week's Partner Showcase</a>, during which new projects from the likes of Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and Capcom were announced for Switch 2 and Switch (as well as other platforms).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VK437OZy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VRGuSIfM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3&nbsp;</em>was just one of many games announced during last week's Partner Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what kind of games can we expect to see at this week's Indie World show? Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest, as is customary for the company, so we don't know exactly what we're going to get.</p>

<p>Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the elephant (or perhaps that should be the bug) in the room. Could this show finally, blessedly deliver us from our wait when it comes to a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date?</p>

<p>There's still reason to hope, even if&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has been absent from many a show in recent months. The game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">getting a demo at this year's Gamescom</a> (albeit at Xbox's booth), so a release date could well be just around the corner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since Team Cherry does seem to have hitched its wagon to Xbox's procession, it's equally possible that we'll be left bereft once again. Still, hopefully, there will be plenty of other great indies to tide us over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=5xb7lgoB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=9Zw-DU7A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm getting tired of asking, Nintendo. Come on. Please.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the case may be, Nintendo's Indie World show will air this Thursday at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern/2pm BST. We'll bring you all the news and announcements from that show as they happen, so check back in with us then for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-%E2%80%94-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom.1262349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> fans pore over the slew of previews that went live recently (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours"><u>you can read ours right here</u></a>), two questions are consistently popping up on social media and fan communities: is the latest mainline Silent Hill <em>really</em> a 'Soulslike' game? And if it is, what does the term 'Soulslike' even mean anyway?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we described in IGN's Silent Hill f hands-on preview, combat itself has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, however, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While series producer Motoi Okamoto hasn't specifically mentioned the Soulslike genre, and by our estimation, Silent Hill f is "by no means a Soulslike," talk of parries and counterattacks come as quite the surprise to Silent Hill fans. The franchise has never been famous for its clunky combat — story and atmosphere have almost always come first — but Okatomo's suggestion that f's combat sequences had been ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has pretty much split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The legacy of FromSoftware’s Souls series isn’t just defined by the amazing games in its back-catalog, but also the subgenre that’s been given life thanks to its very existence: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">The Soulslike</a>. While defining one is kinda tricky, there are core elements that tend to apply to Souls games, such as punishing consequences for death, Souls — or a similar currency — gained by defeating enemies that is integral to character progression and can be lost upon death, methodical combat, typically tied to a stamina meter, and checkpoints that reset the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, however, Soulslike can simply mean tough melee combat that involves learning to predict an enemy's attack pattern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a thread entitled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/silent_hill_f_is_not_soulslike_and_no_one_here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Silent Hill f is not 'souls-like' and no one here seems to know what that means</u></a>," a Redditor said: "Genuinely baffling. This is link [sic] second graders being told to name an object and call a toaster a blender. Like, I don't think you even know what a Soulslike is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having a dodge roll and hard bosses applies to like 90% of third-person games that exist lol. Like you people cannot be serious. Souls games have heavy and light attack, tight-nit dodge intensive combat. You have frame-perfect dodges [...] huge emphasis on stamina management, with shields, break meters, and focus on killing enemies to get c[urrency].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Silent hill f has like 1.5 of those. This blatant lie needs to stop. Anyone with eyes who isn't full of sh*t can see this is nothing like a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the broader confusion between what and what is not indicative of a "Soulslike" game that's frustrating players, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be fair, nobody knows what a Soulslike is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6zgeh4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted</u></a> a respondent. "This is clearly demonstrated on the Soulslike sub by daily arguments about whether or not a game is a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've sunk hundreds of hours into FromSoftware's games and Soulslikes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh"><u>Nioh</u></a>," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6z9t9x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else. "Nothing about Silent Hill f looks like a Soulslike other than there's a target lock-on system and a stamina meter. Which is in, you know: a million other games that are not goddamn Soulslikes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confusingly, others who have also played Souls-inspired games don't concur, however, leading to considerable disagreement to what does, and does not, make a Soulslike game. Is it the melee combat? The need to parry? Or does any game that requires players to learn an enemy's attack pattern count? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m still excited for the game, but the comparisons to Souls combat are really clear guys, like come on…" posited <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n70id3x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one</u></a>. "Invincible dodge, lock on system, light and heavy attacks, multiple attempt boss fights testing your combat prowess… Even the combat UI is clearly inspired by action games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People complain about the combat becoming melee-focused like they don't remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/silent-hill-4-the-room"><u>Silent Hill 4</u></a>. Breakable weapons are essential without the firearms if we still want the game to stay a survival horror," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mi55z5/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_see_anything_wrong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>explained</u></a> another fan. "This whole situation feels like Silent Hill 2 Remake all over again with almost the same talking points."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says"><u>Okamoto said that tougher combat</u></a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Quite how players react to all that when Silent Hill f finally releases next month, of course, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, set in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

The matter came to light after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">fans alleged that the Ho-Oh card's design had been traced from unofficial artwork</a> previously published online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have pointed to yet another card that may have been closely inspired by fan art: Buzzwole EX's Immersive Rare card, which sees the insectoid Ultra Beast flying through space with one arm raised aloft, in a Superman-esque pose. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not an identical copy, the concept, framing and pose is very similar in appearance to a piece of fan art published online back in 2017, some fans have now said. But others aren't so sure, and pointed out that Buzzwole holding its arm up, flexing its swole muscles, is at least something the creature is often seen doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was scrolling through my old camera roll when I thought I saw the immersive Buzzwole but then upon further inspection, it was fanart I saved of him from 2017," Ricky_chimmerton wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTGCP/comments/1metn1y/found_very_old_buzzwole_fanart_from_2017_that" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I know it ain’t an exact copy but this image was definitely referenced for the card we have."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar pose, but not the same. It could have been an inspiration, but it was clearly not traced," countered fellow fan Aestrasz. "The issue is not them taking inspiration from a fan art, and doing a similar pose. The problem was tracing the fan art."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar is an understatement but yeah at least in this case you can see it wasn’t just a complete copy," wrote Plane_pea5434.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, The Pokémon Company said it would now begin an audit of all Pokémon TCG Pocket cards to ensure it had not provided fan artwork as a reference for any other previous cards. By highlighting the similar design of Buzzwole now, fans hope that The Pokémon Company will take note sooner — and either replace the artwork or credit the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards," The Pokémon Company wrote in a statement. "As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the game's immersive Ho-Oh EX card and its sister Lugia EX card (which also features the Ho-Oh design in its animation) simply feature no artwork, and instead include awkward-looking "New Art Coming Soon" placeholder text. It will be interesting to see if Buzzwole EX ends up getting similar treatment, or if The Pokémon Company decides its design can be considered different enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequently, The Pokémon Company doubled down on its explanation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokmon-company-calls-on-fans-to-stop-attacking-or-slandering-illustrator-embroiled-in-tcg-pocket-plagiarism-scandal">its own processes had been fault, rather than the named illustrator on the card</a>, who had been simply following the reference material provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the company stated. "The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>The team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit Peak</a> would rather its community pirate its own game, than play a  "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff that has appeared on Roblox.</p>
<p>The Roblox ripoff in question is Cliff, a release that describes itself as a "challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall". So far, so Peak.</p>

<p>According to the blurb, Cliff players will find themselves "trapped on a mysterious island", and the only way to escape from said island is to reach the top of the "towering" cliff. "Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?" Cliff asks. The creator - PewStudio - does credit Peak as Cliff's inspiration, but this seems to be veering much closer towards imitation territory.</p>
<p>Not only does Roblox's Cliff sound pretty much identical to Peak, but its artwork is also alarmingly similar. You can check out the artwork for Cliff below.</p>

<p>Now compare that with the artwork for Peak, and you can see how this homage is not an homage, but basically a copy and paste effort.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then, we get to the gameplay itself. I've just watched some Cliff videos on YouTube, and again we are well into blatant copying. Both games have an airport as its lobby area (see images below), both games have first person views for climbing, both games have a stamina bar that works in the exact same way…</p>
<p>To quote our own video whizz Alix Attenborough, who I have been chatting with as I write this story up: "If you showed someone this [Cliff] and Peak, they would think they are the same game."</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the Peak team isn't flattered by the arrival of Cliff, and has asked its players not to even entertain the Roblox "ripoff", branding it "microtransaction-riddled… slop". Writing on <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">social media platform X</a>, the Peak team said it would frankly rather people "pirate our game" than even touch Cliff.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, there are many titles which have appeared on Roblox over the years that have been inspired by others that came before. The platform holds a plethora of horror games, which clearly take a lot of their ideas from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> or similar. However, in the case of Cliff, it really does seem like the creator has lifted everything from Peak, and ported it onto the platform, adding none of its own ideas or originality.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked the developers behind Peak for further comment on Cliff, and reaction to its presence on Roblox.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Peak news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/being-able-to-cook-and-eat-your-friends-thats-peak-gameplay">last month the developers added cannibalism as a feature</a>. Yes, cannibalism. You can now eat your friends…</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Many of us have probably been in the situation where you have forgotten where you parked your car, which leads to pacing up and down the rows in the general vicinity of where you think you parked, while wracking your brain for what level and area you pulled up in. It is a situation that can be panic inducing as thoughts go through your mind, like maybe the car was stolen? Then that panic subsides when you see your car and life goes on. A Dream About Parking Lots takes that situation and turns it into a half hour therapy session.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Dream About Parking Lots — Out Now on Consoles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP2EGhbyqwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Dream About Parking Lots is a dreamy maze-like experience in which all you have to do is find the right car. You are armed with a key fob which you can keep pressing in the hope of hearing the car’s horn, which sounds simple enough. However, you must navigate mazes of other cars to find the right one, all the while talking to a therapist. The dialogue has multiple choices that steer the conversation based on your decisions. For the majority of the game, it does genuinely feel like you are having a therapy session, trying to figure out why you are dreaming about parking lots and what it signifies in your own life.</p>


<p>Across the 30 minutes of game time, A Dream About Parking Lots will transport you to different parking lot locations, each with cars parked in a generally neat formation, though there are obstacles that will make you look for the correct path. As you move through the dreams each area gets a bit more off putting. Most scenes still look normal, but they can also be a little disconcerting with things that are not quite right, just like dreams. It’s lent a further surreal element by the retro aesthetic, with blocky, simplistic environments .</p>


<p>The conversation between you and the therapist is the main strength of A Dream About Parking Lots. There is no voice dialogue so you have to read and take in what is being said. There are some poignant life lessons peppered through the dialogue with the responses dependant on the dialogue choices. Like I mentioned earlier, this does feel like a therapy session, even if it does not delve as deep as a real one would.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A Dream About Parking Lots is an interesting little experience that uses a real life situation many of us would have found ourselves in, and uses it to create a therapy session. It is a short and succinct experience that has quite a lot of depth to it, though it isn’t the best looking title.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is being added this Thursday to the game The First Descendant. Nexon's free-to-play third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing</a>, but with the official launch of Season 3 on August 7, GeForce RTX 50 Series will get even better performance thanks to Multi Frame Generation. On average, DLSS 4 runs the game 4.9x faster than native rendering. The flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 226 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (with the transformer model). The RTX 5080 registers 192 FPS under the same conditions.</p>



<p>Season 3 'Breakthrough' also sees the addition of Nell, a new playable character who wields arc-like telekinetic abilities, launching energy spheres that inflict debuffs and pull nearby enemies into her attacks. She is ideal for fast-paced, aggressive, run-and-gun players because she can convert all gunfire into weak point hits. Breakthrough will also expand the game world by adding a big new field area called "Axion" and a formidable Colossus boss battle. Lastly, Players can also look forward to a mountable vehicle, which will allow them to travel faster across the regions of The First Descendant.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is also available (alongside DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex) in the single player survival horror puzzle Death Relives. Developed by small and independent Turkish developer Nyctophile Studios, Death Relives takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and real historical events from the 16th century. Players find themselves in a nightmarish world where they must survive against long-forgotten gods, such as Xipe Totec—the Aztec god of death, life, rebirth, agriculture, vegetation, and deadly warfare. </p>



<p>Throughout the game, they will visit historical locations, such as the ship Hernán Cortés traveled on to reach the land of the Aztecs. The dark and eerie atmosphere of Death Relives hides other entities lurking in the shadows that are revealed through the storyline as the protagonist, Adrian, progresses through the game. Death Relives launched around ten days ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1987400/Death_Relives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> and so far, most user reviews (83%) are positive.</p>

                <p>Fleshy architecture has been a popular choice for developers looking to create uncomfortably squishy levels, but the original team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2</a>--Looking Glass--might have taken things a little <em>too </em>far back in the '90s. According to System Shock 2 artist Nate Wells, the structures inhabited by the hostile aliens known as The Many had a surprising origin, as the art assets included photos of another developer's colonoscopy.</p><p>"When we were working on The Many, if you remember, it has this very biological vibe to it," Wells said to Nightdive's Locke Vincent in the studio's Deep Dive podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/system-shock-2s-alien-sphincter-doors-were-made-with-photos-from-a-devs-colonoscopy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). It's this fleshy mass that has taken over the Rickenbacker. We did these things called 'sphincter doors,' this sphincter that opens up. I was making the doors and doing the concept. I think I was searching through some gross biological [images], like endoscopy sort of stuff. [Looking Glass producer] Josh Randall approached me and said he had a video of his colonoscopy."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egEqjOg9zfE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egEqjOg9zfE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wells said that Randall gave him images from his colonoscopy video, and he used a frozen frame "from somewhere in his large intestine" to create a base texture for the sphincter doors in the game. "If you look at those doors, you're seeing Josh Randall's colon⁠--audio genius Josh Randall's colon," Wells said.</p><p>The rest was history, as System Shock 2 garnered plenty of high praise when it was released in 1999, with most people none the wiser about having explored the inner workings of the human body while fighting a killer worms-like species--years before the Planet Express crew did so in <a href="https://youtu.be/CYKJYOJZUk0" rel="nofollow ">an episode of Futurama</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/">System Shock 2</a>'s 25th-anniversary remaster recently launched for PC, and after a slight delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-remaster-is-finally-out-on-consoles-next-week/1100-6532869/">it landed on consoles in July</a>. The project proved to be a labor of love for Nightdive Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-announced-and-in-d/1100-6469015/">after it was first announced in 2019</a>, as the studio didn't have access to the game's complete source code and it had to piece everything back together with some "extensive" reverse-engineering.</p>

<p>"When you look for excellence in our legacy, [Bad Company 2] is where you find it," Chubb said. "That game particularly delivered on a level of fidelity and a sort of intimate destructive experience. Blasting out a single wall, bringing down a partial building, or entire buildings. It was comprehensive, and it felt like the identity of that game more than anything else."</p><p>Chubb acknowledged this identity was "kind of missing" from Battlefield 2042. "We really wanted to go back to that" with Battlefield 6, the developer said.</p><p>Before this, the designer of Bad Company 2, David Goldfarb, said leaked footage from the Battlefield 6 alpha test was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">giving off "Bad Company 2 vibes."</a> Beyond Bad Company 2, the Battlefield 6 developers have also said they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">inspired by Battlefield 3 and 4.</a></p><p>2021's Battlefield 2042 missed the mark for many fans of the series, and the teams at EA said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reflect-on-battlefield-2042s-poor-launch-and-how-it-shaped-new-game/1100-6533676/" data-ref-id="1100-6533676">they learned a lot from the game's struggles</a>. The sentiment around Battlefield 6 following the big multiplayer reveal recently has been mostly positive, but only time will tell if the game becomes a success.

The plan was for these games to be published by unnamed external partners, spreading out the risks of triple-A development while preserving the team sizes needed for big budget games. The company would be a "stable home" for game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That plan has been put to the test over the last 9 years—and the company still hasn't released any games.

Ryan spoke to Game Developer on the eve of the company revealing its first projects to hit the market: a co-op side-scrolling roguelike called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2—though it will be available there via backwards compatibility) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a first-person psychological horror game for Steam and the Epic Game Store. Both games will retail at the decidedly not-very-triple-A price of $19.99.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan seemed passionate about that price point, drawing a line to how it connects to ProbablyMonsters' new vision for triple-A projects. But passion doesn't account for the fact that to get to this point, he and the leadership team laid off at least 50 workers along the way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most CEOs we ask about layoffs shy away from the topic, quickly falling back on PR talking points. Ryan took the unusual step of raising the layoffs unprompted early in our conversation. He did so in part </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/op-ed-the-upsides-downsides-and-future-of-aaa-game-development">to lay out what's changed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since he shared his vision for triple-A development in a 2020 blog—and why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-">the economic havoc</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftereffects (which were warming up as he wrote that post) upended how he thought the next few years would play out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He argued ProbablyMonsters is on the path to sustainability—but a different kind than what he envisioned five years ago.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing">ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially Ryan attributed the 2024 and 2025 layoffs to the fact that the video game market "moved on and evolved." That phrase echoes what we've heard from other industry leaders describing changing player tastes, competition from user generated content (UGC) platforms, and post-lockdown personal finances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On follow-up, Ryan clarified he was referring more to the state of games funding. "For many of the games, the primary biggest issue was they were built at a scale where they needed a level of funding to finish the game to take it from vertical slice...the way our teams were set up, it was designed to be funded by a publisher. The business model shift in the industry has been pretty drastic across the board as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CEO was careful to avoid specifying if any publishing deals were canceled, reneged, or ended for other means. "I would say that the viability of the offers from publishers didn't support...going in that same direction," he said. He added later that finding new publishers has been difficult because there are fewer and fewer of them. "Two of what were the top seven publishers in the world aren't independent publishers anymore. Microsoft bought Zenimax and Activision Blizzard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether the games could be reworked to ship without a publisher—he said that wasn't possible. "We couldn't responsibly bring [those games] to market without a triple-A publisher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But couldn't they? They raised millions in capital after all. "A lot of games, as you launch them, you need to be able to service them and the scale of the market it's shipping into. You need to continue to ensure the delight of your fanbase," said Ryan. "You need to make sure that not only can you get the game built and launch it, but you can also support it."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan did not indicate if these games were live service titles or if he was referring to post-launch maintenance of single-player games, only that the plan had been for an external publisher to offer resources and fund such an initiative.</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That raises the question: what about the people who set up the teams in that format? What accountability did ProbablyMonsters leader face for laying off workers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan spoke carefully in response to that question. "I do feel like there has been accountability. As CEO, I bear the brunt of the accountability across the board. It's not easy to have gone through that cycle when you're looking at a game and it's just not fundable...as they were in a place where they needed a publisher to be a viable game in the marketplace."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said management "did try" to press on with the canceled games, implying there was research into whether they could take some of the planned live service titles and ship them as standalone retail products.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whatever consequences management faced—he first prefaced by saying that ProbablyMonsters leadership is "directly engaged." (He said no one on the leadership team is relaxing on a beach, waiting for the checks to come in.) Then he declined to state if anyone had been laid off with the affected workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I never want to make public statements about if anyone's ever held accountable to the point where they're released for that reason. I think it hurts their opportunity to learn from it and find another role," he said, noting that for some individuals, the responsibility went all the way back up to the unnamed publishers who stopped funding the games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?">What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan explained that while plenty has changed since his public 2020 declaration on the state of triple-A games, he still feels it's a foundation for sustainability. What's changed since then (besides the market) are the realities of implementing sustainability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One major lesson from the funding frustrations was the decision to ensure ProbablyMonsters's still-in-development games are prepared to make the kind of pivot that the canceled titles couldn't. "A bunch of the games in development today ares ones where we looked at the existing teams and said 'hey, if we could pivot you to a new game and get a game out in the next 18 months, what would you do?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the production structure that's come into focus for ProbablyMonsters includes "short-term games, midterm games, and long-term games," with the goal of releasing multiple games a year at different shapes and sizes. Long-term games are ones with extensive research &amp; development cycles, and are meant to be made with "future technology."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midterm games are ones made with a "deeper bet" on their narrative or "tool chain," but with less R&amp;D than the previous titles. Finally, short-term games are ones where ProbablyMonsters developers looks at the next holiday season and asks "Where do we think there's consumer appetite? Where do we think there's an idea that we have that we're really excited to build with today's tools and technology?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stormlancers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are examples of "short-term games," though he said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is meant to be a standalone game that builds excitement for a future game in the same universe. The "next chapter" of that series has already been greenlit, Ryan said. Other ProbablyMonsters developers are working in other genres—one is working on a co-op "soulslike" (for the unfamiliar, a nascent phrase referring to games inspired by the Dark Souls series), an open-world role-playing game, and an "extraction base-builder."&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal here is to set the teams up in a way that they're sustainably building and launching on a regular basis." That strategy does mirror the "culture of shipping" philosophy we heard about when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">speaking to developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the high costs of making games in the United States in 2024.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ryan, ProbablyMonsters no longer believes that triple-A publishers are a "one-size fits all" approach for the company, and it's now racing to ensure it has positive revenue. When asked if ProbablyMonsters' investors were focused on finding a profitable exit, he said that the company's backers are "100 percent aligned" with his goal of building a sustainable studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The biggest pressure I take on as the CEO is the livelihoods of the employees in the company." ProbablyMonsters' end goal is to "delight the consumer," but he said the means to do that is to make a "predictable, successful, and respectful place for game developers to work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real hard part for everyone in the industry today is the business model. The environment has evolved so much, and the business model has changed so much that it's been hard to maintain the same structure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial results for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and both sales and profits for the publisher are up, driven largely by strong sales for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and its associated titles.</p>

<p>As revealed in its <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_en_Result.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">latest financial statement</a>, Bandai Namco's net sales have risen by 7% when compared to the same period last year, and its operating profit is up by 18%. These rises are more modest than those of last year, but that's to be expected given that the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">landed in that period</a>.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/ir/financialstatements/pdf/20250805_Presentation.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using additional reporting by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreigns-strong-sales-drive-bandai-namcos-game-sector-profits-in-first-quarter/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Bandai Namco attributes this quarter's success at least partly to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which was revealed last month to have sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million copies</a>.</p>

<p>With regards to the future, meanwhile, Bandai Namco has a number of big releases on the horizon. These include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs" rel="nofollow"><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em></a>, a major RPG developed by ex-<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>staffers, and&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, a followup to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/code-vein" rel="nofollow">anime-inflected 2019 Soulslike</a>.</p>

<p>Another big Bandai Namco release coming in the next few months is, of course,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of side-scrolling horror platformers. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">currently due to land in October</a>.</p>

<p>That's despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">layoffs at developer Supermassive Games</a>; when said layoffs were announced, the studio made it clear development on&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>would be unaffected, although sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>has been delayed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[3 Essential Tips For Getting Started In Broken Arrow]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/broken-arrow-tips-starter-deck-recon-infantry-2000614583</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3-essential-tips-for-getting-started-in-broken-arrow.1262250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Though you’re not controlling thousands of individual units, <i>Broken Arrow</i> still requires a basic grasp of combined arms tactics. You’ll soar overhead with attack helicopters, slink through the underbrush with stealthy sniper units, and roam the plains in force with a battalion of armored tanks. Your army is an extension of your will. Knowing how to effectively use each unit, stomp opponents, and take control of sectors is the difference between yet another loss and the coveted win.</p> <h2>Use a starter deck initially</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614585"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614585">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I have a long, storied history in the real-time strategy and tactics genre, and yet, in titles such as <i>Warno</i>, <i>Steel Division 2</i>, and now <i>Broken Arrow</i>, I’ve always been terrible at creating decks. I want to bring everything, to wield every toy in the arsenal, and I wind up with choice paralysis. Ultimately, I opt for the strongest or the most aesthetically pleasing units, and that’s my downfall.</p> <p>If you’re a new player, especially to the whole genre, then <i>Broken Arrow</i> may feel overwhelming with all of its mechanics and macro/micro tactics. To enter the scene and delve straight into deck-building can lead to disaster.</p>

 <p>There are two starter decks: US and Russian. They both approach the 10,000 point limit, with the Russian hitting the cap straight off the bat, and both include an array of units from all disciplines, including recon, infantry, helicopter, and air. They’re both well-rounded, with units designed for introductory gameplay.</p> <h2>Utilize your recon strategically</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614586" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614586"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614586">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I cannot begin to tell you the number of players I’ve met online who chose to outright bumrush opponents instead of wielding all of the tools at their disposal effectively. Namely, recon units. You have access to an array of recon that can hide in dense forests and, so long as they have line of sight, they’ll provide advance notice when enemy units approach.</p> <p><b>Place your recon units strategically.</b> Look at your map, identify chokepoints and ingress points, then note key cover locations for your recon. Get them there quickly.</p>

 <p>Place your recon at the edge of the forest, then hold ‘Alt’ on your keyboard to activate the line of sight tool and ensure your units have a clear field of vision. Second,<b> turn off the ‘Return Fire’ command, which disables auto-fire targeting, allowing them to remain stealthy.</b></p> <h2>Your infantry is an effective tool, but only when used properly</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614587"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614587">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Many new players will resort to a “safe” tactic by deploying mass groups of infantry, thinking the overwhelming force will dominate control points. It’s much easier than controlling tanks, helicopters, and infantry simultaneously, right? Yes, but also no. If you bunch up your infantry, a single bombing run from a jet overhead, or a well-placed artillery/mortar shot, will decimate the entire group.</p> <p>Instead, use your infantry as a pseudo-guerrilla force. Send your infantry toward multiple control points, just to make it seem like you’re spread out across the map in a way that will force your opponent to divert forces elsewhere. Then, flank with your most powerful units, like tanks and helicopters, once the enemy’s forces thin out. If your micro game is on point, you can kite enemies with your infantry to keep them out of harm’s way long enough for reinforcements to push forward. The ol’ bait and switch!</p> <hr> <p><i>Broken Arrow</i> is available now exclusively on Windows PCs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Preloading for the Battlefield 6 beta is available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well, along with the EA app, so the Steam numbers represent just a fraction of the total audience.</p><p>The Battlefield 6 open beta begins on August 7 for a select group of people, including those who signed up for Battlefield Labs by July 31, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">EA Play Pro members</a>, and those who obtained a code from watching a Twitch streamer playing the game. The beta then opens to anyone August 9-10, and then for a second weekend August 14-17. For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p><p>The full game, meanwhile, launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The release date is about a month before Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is rumored to launch on November 14.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Destroying Videogames citizens' initiative</a>, the petition asking EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when official support runs its course</a>, hit its deadline at the end of last month looking like it'd amassed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">more than enough signatures</a>. With that phase over, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign that's vocally supported efforts like this is left to await the outcomes, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>That's given YouTuber Ross Scott, who's become the loudest voice publicising this worldwide push for action on consumer rights when it comes to these sorts of server shutdowns, a chance to take stock of how things have gone to this point. He's keen to take a break, but will first have to see how things pan out with the multiple irons Stop Killing Games and their adjacent groups have in the fire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Since the signing period is over, we're entering a phase where things like counter lobbying and political connections are most important," Scott said in a 'wrap up' video posted to his channel Accursed Farms. "Frankly, that is not my department. I know nothing about that, though some political insiders do, and they're advising the official organizers [of the EU petition]. I'm not even aware of all their plans."</p>
<p>So, that means "a whole lot of the campaign now involves waiting", though Scott did still encourage those who're keen to support it to carry on doing things like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">contacting MEPs about the issue</a>, or helping the initiative's organisers get in contact with EU admin staff if they can.</p>
<p>Looking back on the campaign's efforts and general strategy to this point, Scott reckons those behind it have done well in terms of having "maximized our chances to push back against the issue of games being destroyed on almost every front". While he acknowledged that the group's efforts in a number of countries, such as the USA and Brazil, having hit brick walls in some form or another, Scott said he believes the campaign's "done about as well as is humanly possible given the landscape."</p>

<p>"I think France, Germany, Australia, and the EU as a whole are the heavyweights in this," the YouTuber reasoned, with measures in these places all currently waiting action or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campaign-asking-eu-to-stop-publishers-destroying-online-games-hit-by-anonymous-transparency-complaint">responses from the bodies</a> they're directed at. "As long as we get a major market prohibiting game destruction, I think we'll largely win this globally...I don't see lots of new stuff on the horizon later. I think we either win on at least one of these or if they all fail, then it's over."</p>
<p>With things now at that stage, Scott's aiming to soon take a "standby break" from his volunteering to help promote this cause, only popping up if something happens with the campaign that he thinks would benefit from his intervention.</p>
<p>"I know a lot of people found out about Stop Killing Games just recently, but I've been going at it hard for over a year and a half now, and I wasn't exactly well rested prior to that," the YouTuber said, adding that he ironically hasn't "had time to play a game for close to a couple months now". Here's hoping he is able to take that proper break, while we all wait to see what the outcomes of these bits of action are.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible]]></content:encoded>
