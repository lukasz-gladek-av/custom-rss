Ubisoft has revealed a first proper look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-feudal-japan-title-emerges-from-the-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and detailed the game's dual protagonists. Both characters appear front and centre in the game's new cinematic trailer (gameplay will follow next month, Ubisoft says) and on the game's cover, with each offering a markedly different play style. 
</p>
<p>
Today's trailer opens on Naoe, a female shinobi, as she crosses paths with Yasuke, the historical figure depicted here as a powerful samurai. Initially, it seems, the two are adversaries - but the pair soon find common ground. By the end of the trailer, Naoe is wearing the Assassin's Creed series' iconic Hidden Blade weapon - and both appear to be at least allied with the Assassins.

<p>
For those catching up, or who've avoided leaks, Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on 15th November for PC (via the Ubisoft Store and the Epic Game Store) Mac, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, with three days early access for those with Ubisoft+ or who buy a pricier collector's edition. Development is led by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind 2015's Syndicate and 2018's Odyssey.
</p>
<p>
"With our dual protagonists we have two fantasies: the samurai and the shinobi," game director Charles Benoit said. "We want the player to experience both and we can't squeeze both into one character because the samurai and shinobi came from different social classes, so we can't mix them together."
</p>
<p>
"The historical character of Yasuke presented a really exciting oppurtunity for the narrative team," associate narrative director Brooke Davies added. Yasuke arrived in Japan in 1579, which is when the events of Shadows begin. 
"He had relationships with some of the most interesting people in our setting, like Oda Nobunaga, the Portuguese and Jesuits," Davies continued, "which made it very tantalising and enticing to come in from a narrative perspective and start weaving these facts with story inbetween." Yasuke's perspective as a foreigner discovering Japan is also useful, as a way to explain the country's rules and customs to players. 
</p>
<p>
Naoe, from the mountainous birthplace of the shinobi, crosses paths with Yasuke when he arrives to destroy her village. Her father is the historical figure Fujibayashi Nagato.
</p>
<p>
The two characters represent two different approaches to the game: the combat-heavy samurai, and the stealth-focused shinobi. And it's the latter character, Naoe, who will be the only one of the two wielding the Assassin's Creed series' iconic hidden blade weapon. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows is set during a period when Japan is in a bloody path to unification, and influenced by foreign forces. The game's open world will feature "spectacular castle towns and bustling ports to peaceful shrines and pastoral landscapes", Ubisoft has said, and will change through the seasons and in different weather. 
 
Exploration will be a key part of the game, Ubisoft continues, with a spies network to unveil new areas and targets, allies to call upon during missions, and a customisable hideout where you can train your squad.

            <p>
Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-battling-assassins-creed-shadows-leaks-as-main-character-art-appears-online">flurry of pre-announcement leaks</a>, Ubisoft has shared first official details of its feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed Shadows - including confirmation of its 15th November release date and information on its various "premium" editions, a physical collector's edition, and a season pass giving access to two post-launch expansions and an exclusive quest.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows, a full-scale series entry following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">smaller-scale Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, was confirmed to be in the works back in September 2022 (albeit under the title Codename Red) and comes from Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018's lovable Assassin's Creed Odyssey. As previously rumoured, it'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">feature two protagonists</a>: a female ninja, Naoe, and Yasuke, a male samurai based on a real historical figure.
</p>
<p>
As part of today's reveal event, Ubisoft has given a first tease of Assassin's Creed Shadows in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8">moody new cinematic story trailer</a>, alongside various other bits of pre-launch information. For starters, there's that season pass, which'll provide access to two post-launch expansions and an exclusive quest line available from launch day - none of which have been detailed so far.
</p>

<p>
As is Ubisoft's way, Assassin's Creed Shadows is releasing in a variety of increasingly expensive forms. Alongside the £59.99 base game (£69.99 on consoles), there's a £94.99 Gold Edition adding the season pass and three days "early access", plus a £114.99 Ultimate Edition adding five skill points, the Sekiryu character pack and hideout pack, plus the Red Dragon photo filter. And Ubisoft isn't stopping with the season pass-exclusive quest - there's another one, Thrown to the Dogs, coming with all pre-orders.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Ubisoft has announced a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/7v5jsrR7b9rRQ1Cy29eMf7/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition">physical Collector's Edition</a> which includes everything from the Ultimate Edition, plus a Naoe &amp; Yasuke figurine, a life-sized version of Naoe's Tsuba katana, a wall Creed Scroll, a world-map, an 84-page art book, two sumi-e lithographs, and a steelbook case. There's no price for this extravagant bundle just yet, but don't expect it to be cheap.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic), plus Macs with Apple silicon on 15th November. It'll mark the start of a new era for Ubisoft's franchise, being the first game to ditch the series' divisive modern-day narrative - which will now be told via an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">over-arching hub platform named Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once Assassin's Creed Shadows arrive that'll leave just two of the four previously confirmed new series entry to go: the witchy looking Codename Hexe - set in 16th century Europe - which appears to be targeting a 2026 launch, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-jade-likely-delayed-to-2025-report">mobile-focused Codename Jade</a>.

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 15th and will follow the stories of shinobi Assassin Naoe and African samurai Yasuke, the latter of whom is&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s first real-life protagonist.</p>
<p>The game will take place in the Azuchi-Momoyama era of Japanese history (that's the late 16th to very early 17th century) and will dovetail the stories of the two characters as they "usher in a new era for Japan", according to Ubisoft.</p>

<p>Rather, it sounds like both of their stories will be critical to the narrative, so you'll be playing as both of them in turn, not dissimilarly to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</em>'s playable twins.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>right here. It sets up Naoe and Yasuke's stories and gives a hint as to how they'll interact over the course of the story.</p>

<p>Along with the cinematic premiere, Ubisoft has also released a deep dive video into the characters of Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<p>It features interviews with game director Charles Benoit, who's previously worked as a designer on games like&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/immortals-fenyx-rising"><em>Immortals Fenyx Rising</em></a>, and associate narrative director Brooke Davies.</p>
<p>You can check that video out here if you want to know more about what Ubisoft has in store for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. It's expected to return to the open-world RPG stylings of&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla&nbsp;</em>after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back">back-to-basics experiment of&nbsp;<em>Mirage</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>After being unceremoniously thrown into the spotlight yesterday with a pre-reveal leak, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> has been given a proper unveiling via a flashy cinematic trailer, confirming both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ac-game-set-in-feudal-japan-is-called-assassins-creed-shadows-may-have-leaked-its-own-release-date">its leaked November release date</a> and revealing that we’ll be playing as two protagonists for the first time in the series since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Syndicate</a> almost a decade ago. One of those heroes will also be the series’ first playable real-life figure: the African samurai Yasuke.</p>

<p>Yes, as it turns out, ‘Shadows’ does indeed mean multiple playable protagonists, making the long-expected ‘Assassin’s Creed ninja game’ both a ninja AND samurai game. Sneaky shinobi Naoe fits into the classic mould of Assassin’s Creed, uh, assassins, specialising in creeping up on targets - helped by the ability to zip around using a new grappling hook - and stabbing them with the familiar hidden blade.</p>
<p>While Naoe is the fictional daughter of a real-life figure of the time, legendary ninja leader Fujibayashi Nagato, Yasuke is himself a real-life person - the first time players have taken control of an actual historical figure in Assassin’s Creed rather than just chatting to them. The African-born swordsman is renowned for being Japan’s first Black samurai, serving under famous daimyo Oda Nobunaga - known for working to unify the country in the 16th century. (Nobunaga’s efforts would ultimately be completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu - the inspiration for Toranaga in recent and very excellent TV show Shogun.)</p>
<p>Compared to Naoe’s stealthy focus, Yasuke will excel more in direct combat - making his playstyle closer to the action-RPG feel of more recent Assassin’s Creed games or the similarly samurai-focused <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>

<p>While we don’t see any actual gameplay in the cinematic trailer - nice as it looks and all - <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">IGN</a> wrangled some more details out of developers Ubisoft, including info on a reworked lighting system that will help Naoe to hide in the - ahem - shadows like Sam Fisher, the grappling hook traversal I mentioned above, which can also be used to assassinate like a deadly Spider-Gwen, and a reworking of the underlying Anvil engine that’ll let Yasuke’s samurai sword cut into objects realistically, which made me think of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a>’s still-unparalleled melon-slicing tech. There’ll apparently be the chance to engage in some classic Kurosawa-like samurai duels, too.</p>
<p>The world will also be more dynamic, cycling through the seasons in a way that will encourage the player to adapt. One example given was that a pond you might be able to duck under during summer could be frozen over during winter, removing a hiding spot. Another was that grass might be tall enough to sneak through in spring, but vanishes in autumn. The seasons will affect the entirety of Shadows’ map, which was compared to the size of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a> in its recreation of central Japan.</p>
<p>We’ll see and hear more ahead of Shadows’ November 15th release date sometime next month, according to Ubisoft. As an unabashed liker of Assassin’s Creed, samurai and ninja, though, I’m certainly intrigued.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been fully revealed and is making its way to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC later this year on November 15. It’s a monumental title from Ubisoft that’s sure to revive the Assassin’s Creed franchise even more than Mirage did when it was released in October 2023. In the all-new cinematic trailer that was recently revealed, we received an epic showcase of the two brand-new characters that are fronting Assassin’s Creed Shadows: a Shinobi named Naeo and a Samurai called Yasuke.</p>



<p>This dual-protagonist system might seem familiar as it smacks of the core mechanic present in 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, which was set in Victorian London and also featured a dual-protagonist system made up of a male-female split.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-syndicate-but-with-samurai-and-shinobi">Syndicate But With Samurai and Shinobi</h2>



<p>On the surface, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Assassin’s Creed Syndicate couldn’t be more different. They’re poles apart in terms of their setting, their respective places in the overall timeline, and the story that unravels throughout a lengthy playthrough.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYVRifBnD2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>But at the heart of both games sits an identical dynamic: a dual-protagonist system built on the foundation of one male and one female character. </p>



<p>Yasuke and Naoe have dramatically different backgrounds, while Assassin’s Creed Syndicate’s Jacob and Evie Frye are biological brother and sister – twins, in fact. However, from the trailer that was released by Ubisoft recently, we get the stark impression that these two duos will function in a very similar – if not identical – way. </p>



<p>In Syndicate, Evie Frye was an agile, quiet, and stealthier character, relying more on subterfuge and weapons like throwing knives to get the job done. Jacob, on the other hand, was brash, heavy-set, and preferred an open brawl to a silent dagger in the back. From what we’ve seen, Naoe and Yasuke will function the same way, with the former utilising ‘ninja skills’ to fly around the map fluidly, while Yasuke makes use of heavy weapons, thick armour, and full-frontal attacks to achieve his goals.</p>



<p>At any point, players can switch between the two characters to take on missions how they see fit, but it’s widely assumed that they’ll have ‘character-locked’ missions that only one or the other can undertake – which is how things worked for Jacob and Evie Frye.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has canceled Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland. The decision comes three years after the free-to-play shooter was initially announced.</p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately,” the company said in a statement to Insider Gaming. “Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</p>



<p>The news of the game’s cancellation was told to staff in an email on Wednesday morning, ahead of <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s earnings call</a>. In the earnings report, Ubisoft said the decision comes as part of the company’s “increased selectivity of its investments”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game saw a significant shift in its design since its announcement and we’ll share more details on what the game entailed at a later date.</p>



<p>Throughout its development, the game has seen multiple betas with players and was even rated by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-heartland-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taiwanese ratings board</a>. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1790784564354281779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson</a>, the playtests and betas “didn’t resonate with players”.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the statement above, development of the game was being led by Red Storm Entertainment, the studio behind the original Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon games.</p>



<p>The news of the game’s cancellation also comes the same day when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest installment in the Assassin’s Creed franchise</a>, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was officially revealed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-40-details-you-need-to-know.871887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-40-details-you-need-to-know<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After years of fans asking for a feudal Japan-set game, Ubisoft has finally announced Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Set during the era of samurai and shinobi, it brings elegant katana duels and the ninja arts to the franchise. </p><p>IGN recently visited Ubisoft Québec for an exclusive look inside Assassin’s Creed Shadows, where we spoke to seven different developers about what they’ve been creating. You can check out our in-depth interview to learn more, but if you like your details in quick-fire list formats then you’re in the right place. Here’s everything we know about Assassin’s Creed Shadows so far.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>The Setting</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes place in the Azuchi-Momoyama period of Japanese history. The story begins in 1579 and will continue into the early 1580s. The time period means this is the first game in the series to feature the Assassins and Templars in their ‘classic’ forms since 2015’s Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.  </li><li>A number of historical figures play prominent roles in the campaign. These include Oda Nobunaga, the “great unifier” of Japan, and Fujibayashi Nagato, a master ninja of the Iga clan.   </li><li>Much like Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, Shadows features two protagonists and you can switch between them as you play through the campaign. The first of these dual leads is Naoe, the fictional daughter of Fujibayashi Nagato. She is trained by her father to be a skilled shinobi.</li><li>The second protagonist is Yasuke, a real historical figure. Originally from Africa, Yasuke came to Japan with the Portuguese in 1579 and soon became a samurai in the employ of Lord Oda Nobunaga. Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed game to ever let you play as a real person from the past. </li></ul><h2>Stealth and Parkour</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>As the title suggests, light and dark is a major part of Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth systems. A new global illumination system creates dynamic light and shadows that affect enemy vision. You can now hide in shadows and even create darkness by destroying lanterns or killing torch carriers. A light meter on the UI shows how well concealed you are, from fully visible to completely hidden. </li><li>Servants are a new type of NPC, ranking between civilians and enemies. While they cannot fight, they are able to call in reinforcements and raise alarms. They have their own patrol routes, and carry lanterns at night.</li><li>There is now the option to knock out foes when performing a stealth takedown, allowing for a more pacifist playthrough.</li><li>You can now crawl along the ground in a prone position, allowing you to maintain a lower profile as well as get through small openings. </li><li>Naoe has a grappling hook that can be attached to every roof edge, as well as a number of other anchor points. Unlike the zipline-like grappling hook from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, this rope uses physics simulation to allow dynamic swinging.</li><li>The grappling hook can be used to quickly climb into the ceiling space above corridors, allowing you to lay in wait for enemies patrolling beneath you. </li><li>Eagle vision returns, allowing you to spot silhouettes of NPCs through walls. Enemies are marked in red, while the new servants are coloured orange. </li><li>The drone-like bird, used in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla to scout out areas and mark targets, is not available in Shadows. You’ll need to do your own reconnaissance work. </li><li>As a shinobi, Naoe is the most skilled at stealth. Yasuke can use stealth, but his size and armour plating means he’s better at using those skills to get the drop on targets rather than perform a fully silent infiltration. </li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2>Combat and RPG Systems</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>This era of Japanese warfare did not make use of shields, so your gear does not include any defensive options aside from your armour. Dodges and positioning is paramount. </li><li>As a samurai, Yasuke is able to use his weapon to block incoming attacks and perform parries. Naoe is able to engage in combat, but she is unable to block or parry – instead she can ‘deflect’ enemy blows. Ubisoft didn’t clarify the difference between paries and deflects, but it may be that parries enable counter attacks while deflects are a more evasive tactic.</li><li>Enemy armour has a durability system and can be broken during combat.</li><li>Pretty much every prop in the game is able to be dynamically damaged by your weapons. Katanas will slice through bushes and baskets Fruit Ninja-style, leaving accurate blade marks. Arrows will leave precise puncture marks, while blunt weapons will smash pots into tiny pieces.  </li><li>Many period accurate weapons are available to use, including katanas, the kanabō war club, yari spears, shuriken, kunai, and the kusarigama (a sickle on a chain). </li><li>Yasuke is able to use arquebus rifles, providing him with a powerful long-range option. </li><li>Each weapon has its own skill tree. Investing time into using a particular weapon will improve your proficiency with it. </li><li>You can craft your own katana from gathered components and personalise it. A transmog system will also allow you to tailor your gear to look exactly how you want it. </li><li>Active combat skills return and are unlocked by finding Ninja Scrolls in the world. </li><li>Yasuke and Naoe have individual skill trees and gear, but share XP, collected weapons, and resources. </li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exclusive Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>Dynamic World and Seasons</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is built upon a newly updated version of the Anvil game engine. The new tech allows for better lighting through global illumination, the new breakable props, more detailed asset meshes, and much less pop-in.</li><li>The new Anvil upgrade has allowed for a season system that sees the world progress through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The current season is dictated by your progress through the campaign in order to maintain historical accuracy, but there are ‘steps’ that each period goes through to create a sense of authenticity. </li><li>Each season comes with unique features that link to gameplay. For example, in the spring and summer when plants bloom and flower, there will be bushes and long grass to hide in. Later, in autumn and winter, those plants will die and thus remove hiding spots. Water also freezes in winter, which prevents you from entering pools and ponds. Icicles will form on rooftop edges and can fall if disturbed, potentially giving away your position. </li><li>Seasons also affect NPC behaviours. In the summer, enemy samurai cut through bushes in search of you. In the winter, foes stay close to fires and warm places, potentially opening up new, colder paths for you to take. </li><li>A fully dynamic weather system provides appropriate climate conditions based on both the region and season. Severe weather, like deep fog, howling winds, and snow impacts enemy sight and sound. A storm is an opportunity to mask your footsteps. </li><li>The world features a surprisingly detailed ecology system. In spring, for instance, wind will blow gusts of pollen that have been spawned by trees, replicating a real ecosystem. </li><li>The map is similar in size to that featured in Assassin's Creed Origins, and replicates the central region of Japan.</li><li>The map is divided into regions based on Japan’s real historical provinces, including Iga (the home of the shinobi), Arima (the location of a major battle), and Omi (an agriculture “bread basket” region.) </li><li>The iconic synchronisation points return, but in a reimagined way. Climbing to the top no longer plots a multitude of icons on your map, nor does it trigger the spinning ‘drone’ shot of the area. Instead, from this vantage point you’re able to survey the area for highlighted points of interest, which you can then seek out when back on the ground. Ubisoft expressed a wish for there to be less icons this time around, and so this appears to be one way of fulfilling that. Thankfully, despite this slight change, synchronisation points still act as fast travel locations. </li><li>Shadows is set during a time of flourishing urbanisation, trade, and warfare. This allows for a wide range of locations, including towns, trading posts, farm land, and colossal castles that have been rendered at near 1:1 scale. Beyond these settled areas are mountains and forests.  </li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Assassinations and Quests</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Shadows features a non-linear campaign largely focused on targets. Ubisoft says that you will be free to track these targets in any order.</li><li>Some targets simply exist in the world and you may stumble upon them organically, without having researched and hunted them first. Others have more structured infiltration-style gameplay attached to them. </li><li>Ubisoft aims to create a more rewarding journey by being a little more hands-off. While the campaign is still objective-focused, the studio hopes to enable more player autonomy by using hints to push players in the right direction rather than outright telling them where to go next. </li><li>Most main quests can be completed as either Yasuke or Naoe, allowing for freedom of approach. However, both characters also have their own specific missions playable only by them, as well as bespoke introduction quests.</li><li>Side quests and world activities are available beyond the main campaign. Notable things to find in the world include castles, temples, shrines, and art. </li><li>You can build up a spy network, with agents who can be sent on missions to gather intelligence on your targets.</li><li>There is a hideout where you and your allies can gather. </li></ul><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Assassin's Creed: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>From 2007's debut title to the upcoming console, PC, mobile, and VR projects, here is the entire Assassin's Creed series in one list.

Naturally that means we’ll be exploring the life of a Japanese character – the daughter of famed ninja master Fujibayashi Nagato. But Shadows has a second protagonist: an African samurai. If you’re surprised to see a man of such origins wielding a katana, you may not know his fascinating true story. This is Yasuke, Japan’s first Black samurai, and the first real historical person to be a playable protagonist in an Assassin’s Creed game. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><h2>Origins</h2><p>You may have come across Yasuke before, as he’s been depicted in Netflix’s Yasuke anime series, as well as made an appearance in the Nioh games, but little is known about his life before his days as a samurai, including his original name - ‘Yasuke’ was bestowed on him during his stay in Japan. But historians believe he was born in West Africa. Thomas Lockley, co-author of ‘African Samurai: The True Story of Yasuke, a Legendary Black Warrior in Feudal Japan’, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=says%20it%E2%80%99s%20possible%20Yasuke%20was%20enslaved%20and%20trafficked%20as%20a%20child" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theories he was enslaved and trafficked as a child</a>. </p><p>The historical details of his departure from Africa are equally unclear, but some scholars believe that he left his homeland as a mercenary. Later, he met Alessandro Valignano – an Italian Jesuit missionary who would <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/#:~:text=They%20came%20by%20way%20of%20India%2C%20and%20according%20to%20Lockley%2C%20Yasuke%20was%20in%20service%20to%20Valignano%20most%20likely%20as%20a%20bodyguard.%20%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20priest%20he%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20allowed%20to%20have%20any%20soldiers%20or%20guards%2C%E2%80%9D%20Lockley%20said%20of%20the%20Jesuit%20missionary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employ Yasuke as something of a bodyguard</a>. Valignano planned to travel to Japan, which at the time was locked in a civil war, and so would need protection. </p><p>The two arrived in Japan in 1579 (the year Assassin’s Creed Shadows begins), and the tall African mercenary stunned the Japanese locals.

Valignano sought Nobunaga to ask permission to leave the country, but during their meeting the daimyō became fascinated by the Jesuit’s African bodyguard. </p><p>A <a href="https://www.heritagedaily.com/2021/05/yasuke-the-african-samurai/138929#:~:text=The%20Shinch%C5%8D%20k%C5%8Dki,this%20first%20meeting.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronicle of Nobunaga</a> written in Japan’s Edo period, The Shinchō kōki, describes the meeting: “On the 23rd of the 2nd, a black page came from the Christian countries. The man was healthy with a good demeanour and Nobunaga praised Yasuke’s strength. Nobunaga’s nephew gave him a sum of money at this first meeting.” </p><p>While many African people lived in Japan in the 16th century, working as interpreters, soldiers, and other professions, it may be that Nobunaga had never encountered someone with dark skin before. “Yasuke was brought before Nobunaga and he didn’t believe Yasuke’s true skin color was black,” said Thomas Lockley in an interview with <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>. The daimyō apparently ordered him to be scrubbed, believing his colour was due to paint or dirt. When learning the truth, Nobunaga threw a welcome party. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke#:~:text=The%20black%20man,lord%22).%5Bf%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1582 Annual Report of the Jesuit Mission in Japan</a>, Portuguese missionary Luís Fróis wrote that, “The black man understood a little Japanese, and Nobunaga never tired of talking with him,” and that “Some people in the town thought that Nobunaga might make him as tono [a high-ranking samurai].”  </p><p>Yasuke was reportedly incredibly strong, and thus an ideal candidate for a samurai. In The Chronicle of Lord Nobunaga, written by one of the lord’s followers in the 17th century, Yasuke is described as “[appearing] to be 26 or 27 years old. … This man looked robust and had a good demeanor. What is more, his formidable strength surpassed that of ten men.” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian Magazine</a> notes that other historic reports compliment his intelligence and imposing stature. </p><p>While Nobunaga employed thousands of samurai, Yasuke was his first foreign-born warrior. According to Lockley, he was part of the lord’s <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cthe%20very%20small%20entourage%20around%20Nobunaga%2C%20which%20%5Bwas%5D%20probably%20around%2030%20to%2050%20%5Bwarriors%5D%2C%20mainly%20young%20men%2C%20many%20of%20%5Bwhom%20were%20Nobunaga%E2%80%99s%5D%20lovers%20as%20well%2C%E2%80%9D%20Lockley%20says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“very small entourage.”</a> </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/oda-nobunaga-1715693075944.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ukiyo-e of Oda Nobunaga, made by Utagawa Kuniyoshi in 1830 for the "Kuniyoshi's Warriors" collection.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Nobunaga’s Downfall</h2><p>Yasuke’s career in service of Nobunaga was short-lived. In the year following their first meeting, the daimyō was betrayed by one of his own generals. On June 21, 1582, Akechi Mitsuhide ambushed Nobunaga in Kyoto with thousands of troops. At the Honnō-ji temple, Nobunaga performed seppuku, the ritual suicide in which a person disembowls themself. While it’s believed that Nobunaga’s lover, Mori Ranmaru, acted as his second – cutting off the lord’s head to complete the ritual – <a href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/#:~:text=Yasuke%20was%20in%20the%20temple%20with%20Nobunaga%20when%20he%20performed%20seppuku.%20%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20no%20record%2C%20but%20tradition%20holds%20it%20that%20%5BYasuke%5D%20was%20the%20one%20who%20took%20Nobunaga%E2%80%99s%20head%20to%20save%20it%20from%20the%20enemy%2C%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tradition claims that Yasuke was tasked with taking Nobunaga’s head</a> so that it wouldn’t fall into the hands of the enemy. </p><p>With his lord gone, Yasuke is said to have sought out Nobunaga’s son, Oda Nobutada, who was nearby. He fought with Nobutada’s men against Mitsuhide, but they were completely outnumbered. Lockley believes Yasuke was likely left wounded on the battlefield. The last historical record of Yasuke states he was escorted by Akechi’s troops to a Jesuit mission house. “What we do know is that Mitsuhide did not execute Yasuke,” explained historian Natalia Doan to <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20we%20do%20know%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Doan%2C%20%E2%80%9Cis%20that%20Mitsuhide%20did%20not%20execute%20Yasuke.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithsonian Magazine</a>.   </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/yasuke-anime-netflix-1715692784512.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Yasuke featured as the protagonist in Netflix's 2021 anime adaptation of the samurai's story. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Pop-Culture Legacy</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Talking to IGN</a>, Sachi Schmidt-Hori – a Professor of Japanese Literature and Culture working with Ubisoft on Assassin’s Creed Shadows – says “Yasuke has been featured in many creative writings and media. If you go to Wikipedia for Yasuke's page, there's a long, long list of novels, TV series, dramas that have been inspired by him, he as a historical character or somebody who was inspired by him. I think people in Japan really, really embrace him as a character, and we really like to see him representing the samurai spirit.”</p><p>In Japan, one of the most famous stories influenced by his life is Kuro-suke by Kurusu Yoshio, which received the Japanese Association of Writers for Children Prize in 1969. In 1971, Shūsaku Endō published the satirical novel Kuronbō, which was also inspired by Yasuke. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A number of Japanese period dramas about Yasuke have been produced, and he has appeared as a character in the manga series Hyouge Mono, The Man Who Killed Nobunaga, and Nobunaga's Chef. He’s also a side character in Team Ninja’s Nioh games (the first of which also focuses on a foreign samurai, William Adams.) </p><p>In more recent years, the legendary warrior has featured as the protagonist of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yasuke-season-1-review-netflix-lakeith-stanfield">Netflix anime series Yasuke</a>, voiced by LaKeith Stanfield. He was also set to be the central figure of a Lionsgate-produced live action movie called Black Samurai, with the late Chadwick Boseman planned to portray him. Earlier this year, a spec script written by Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz “the Ambassador” Bazawule, also called Black Samurai, was acquired by Warner Bros. Bazawule is set to direct.  </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Kicking back at home base is one of the only comforts of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-gray-zone-warfare-ever-have-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a>,&nbsp;</em>where you can temporarily put your mind at ease. Unfortunately, several players disrupt the peace through a pesky grenade exploit, stealing gear from their own teammates. The issue will, thankfully, be resolved soon now that it’s on Madfinger Games’ radar.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">The exploit unfolds in a rather cunning manner. It begins when a fellow player from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gray-zone-warfare-factions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your faction</a> hurls a grenade at you and then abruptly exits the game.&nbsp;This action, while they are no longer in the server, inflicts fatal damage to your character. To add insult to injury, another player, presumably on lookout duty, swoops in to loot your gear.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can kill your own faction members at base camp with this new grenade bug in Gray Zone Warfare 😔 I've seen this a lot more often in the past 24 hours and this 100% needs to be fixed ASAP or it will cause players to quit. <a href="https://t.co/vlrHMwsIJ5">pic.twitter.com/vlrHMwsIJ5</a></p>— Martonic (@MartonicTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/MartonicTV/status/1790675723147149702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">While this exploit&nbsp;has been a source of frustration and betrayal, the community’s vigilance has not gone unnoticed. Madfinger Games has caught wind of the issue, indicating that it will be “resolved soon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes indeed. This has unfortunately been an exploit for some time now. This will be resolved soon. Stay tuned.</p>— Gray Zone Warfare (@GrayZoneWarfare) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1790710322182922549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">It’s unclear how the team will handle this exploit. Some players have suggested the team put a dud grenade instead while at home base. That way, it won’t result in your demise. But, in the meantime, users have found a temporary solution where you can select the ‘Safely End Deployment’ button to save your gear.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Since its launch, Madfinger Games has released a few hotfixes to resolve issues like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gray-zone-warfare-hotfix-3-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappearing head</a>. However, the game has yet to have a major update with its official Patch 1. The grenade exploit could be fixed through this patch, but there isn’t an exact timeframe on the matter.</p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">For now, you may just want to keep a watchful eye on your own teammates. You never know when you might get stabbed in the back.</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Airship Syndicate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> that the troubled MMO <em>Wayfinder</em> will be course-correcting. The developer is dropping the online requirement for the game, and removing all microtransactions. It will now be a single, upfront fee to purchase.</p> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Remember <em>Wayfinder</em>? I haven’t thought about it in quite a while. To say its launch was troubled is a bit of an understatement. On the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/online-arpg-wayfinder-hits-early-access-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day of its launch</a>, it garnered nearly 8,000 negative use reviews on Steam, and things have not really improved. Looking at reviews from around the time it released, players complained primarily about bugs, server issues, and numerous other issues alongside.</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Back in April, Airship Syndicate announced that they’d be going separate ways with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/digital-extremes-cuts-jobs-closes-external-projects-division/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publisher Digital Extremes</a> and removed <em>Wayfinder </em>from sale temporarily. At the time, the developer hinted that there would be some change, but the language implied it was going to continue being a largely online game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">After consideration, <em>Airship Syndicate </em>is shifting <em>Wayfinder</em> to a primarily single-player game. There will still be three-player co-op, but it will be entirely peer-to-peer.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">A lot of new negative reviews are from players who purchased an MMO only to have it shift into single-player. I totally understand the frustration. It’s pretty terrible for anyone who already dropped money on in-game currency and items. Airship Syndicate has said that these things will be shifted into the offline version, but without the MMO part of the game, those items (and especially the currency) have lost their perceived value.</p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">However, I think the alternative here would be for <em>Wayfinder</em> to shut down and disappear entirely. And then nobody gets anything. It would just be another dead MMO in a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/update-marvel-heroes-shuts-down-with-immediate-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sea of corpses</a>. The developer and publisher had the responsibility to deliver a game that survived and thrived, and failed to provide one that lasted even a year. That warrants anger, and the onus is on Airship Syndicate to smooth things over. As it stands, at least it’s not nothing.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The current plan is to soft-launch <em>Wayfinder</em> to all existing owners on May 31st, followed by a broader release into Early Access on June 11th on PC. For PlayStation people, the relaunch with the Echoes Update will be sometime in the Summer. They plan on having the full launch take place sometime in the Fall for all platforms.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft has revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and, following a whole host of leaks in the last two days, confirmed details surrounding its story and lead characters, as well as the release date. Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on 15th November for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac &amp; Luna.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>

<p>Here’s a bit more of a dive into who these characters are:</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s not just this pair, as you’ll be able to build your own spy network to feed you information on new areas and hunt targets. Allies can also be recruited and help during missions with customisable hideouts where you can train your crew.</p>
<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game. The Ultimate Pack will contain the Sekiryu Character Pack (Naoe and Yasuke outfit and weapon, trinket and mount), the Sekiryu Hideout Pack, 5 Skill points and a Red and black photo mode filter.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector’s Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack, physical content and 3 days early access to the game. The physical content will be a Steelbook, the World map, Naoe &amp; Yasuke Figurine, life-size Naoe’s Katana Tsuba, a Wall Creed Scroll, an 84 pages collector’s artbook and 2 sumi-e lithographs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In case any of those are new to you, that's Rockstar's well-received open-world cowboy sequel (which follows the recent PlayStation release of its predecessor), a Sims 4 expansion, Deceive Inc's multiplayer "social stealth and subterfuge", cooperative first-person heist shooting in Crime Boss: Rockay City, and real-time strategy city-building via The Settlers: New Allies.
</p>
<p>
Extra subscribers also get sci-fi survival sim Stranded: Alien Dawn, family friendly action-adventure The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, open-world hacking action in Watch Dogs 2, and Cat Quest 1 &amp; 2 - two super-streamlined, wonderfully approachable mini-RPGs that are a bit of a treat.
</p>
<p>
But that's not all! Subscribers to Sony's PlayStation Plus Premium tier get all the above alongside a fresh batch of Classics catalogue additions on 21st May:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2Xtreme (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>G-Police (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Worms Pinball (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
But while one hand giveth, the other takes away. As previously spotted - and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/?sf273104493=1">now confirmed in Sony's blog post</a> - Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition, one of the publisher's flagship first-party titles, will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">removed from the PlayStation Plus catalogue</a> on 21st May.

            <p>Alzara Radiant Echoes is a clear love letter to golden age JRPGs, pulling inspiration from the likes of Golden Sun and Lost Odyssey for a 3D turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a Mediterranean fantasy world. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> composer Motoi Sakuraba is on board, along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and Fire Emblem artist Yoshiro Ambe. And if that hadn’t already sold me already, developers Studio Camelia are also paying tribute to the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy game</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/StudioCamelia_/status/1788627413791866949">FFIX</a>, obviously.</p>

<p>Alzara makes no bones about the fact it’s heavily indebted to JRPG classics, throwing the likes of Persona, Chrono Cross and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy X</a> on top of its already teetering pile of inspirations. Its titular world is built on the familiar four-element foundations of Fire, Air, Water and Earth seen in the likes of the original Final Fantasy (plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-iv">FFIV</a>), as well as bringing in another key inspiration for its elemental-based battles: Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p>
<p>The story follows element-harnessing hero Kayla as she forms a party with a group of companions (stop me if you’ve heard this one before) and Alzara’s resistance to help fend off an invasion from the neighbouring nation of Vedores. The setting pulls in real-world inspiration from southern France to Greece and Egypt, with players able to eventually set sail around the Taqsim archipelago and wider open world in a boat - because, of course.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/alzara-radiant-echoes-town.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>So, all fairly familiar stuff, but Alzara looks like it will have the gameplay goods to back up its grab-bag of inspirations. Using elements in battles works much like the rock-paper-scissors combos of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/pokemon">Pokémon</a> or Persona, with certain elements being stronger against others and specialising in different combat techniques - whether the defensive Earth, offensive Fire, fast-and-furious Air or supportive Water.</p>
<p>How you arrange your allies will also play a role, with sticking them up front draining their resource of Echo - requiring exhausted heroes to swap out to the back row to catch a breather and refill their energy. Swap with a character whose Echo is full and they’ll jump in with an extra opening move, too. Swapping also allows those core elements to be combined into new elements, not unlike in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> (through presumably with less explosive chaos) - Fire and Air create Thunder, for example, while mixing Water and Earth will get you Plant.</p>
<p>There’s an equivalent of Final Fantasy’s summons in here too, with Legends being brought into battle by making offerings - a temporary stats debuff that will stack Favours, which can then be spent on powerful moves. How many Favours you stack determines the strength of the attack, in an interesting twist to the fixed cost of traditional summons.</p>

<p>Alzara’s first gameplay trailer looks and sounds the part thanks to the presence of Souls and Golden Sun co-composer Sakuraba and the character designs of Ambe, who has also worked on Fire Emblem Heroes and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trials-of-mana">Trials of Mana</a> alongside Genshin. The art style and animation look very slick indeed, with the flashes of combat gameplay and puzzle-dungeon exploration very much tickling my itch for modern takes on turn-based battles and open-world exploration.</p>
<p>The game is already galloping towards its crowdfunding goal <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics">over on Kickstarter</a>, with the aim of raising €100,000 to fund a release on Steam (and consoles) in 2026.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week Ubisoft finally shone a light on <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-official-title-for-assassins-creed-red-reveal-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the new Feudal Japan-set RPG-style adventure from the team at Ubisoft Quebec, that was originally known by the codename <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/assassins-creed-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin’s Creed Red</a>. Since then, a few other tidbits have leaked, including a release date and some details about the game’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC and pricing plans</a>. That said, fans were understandably still hungry for more.</p>
<p>Well, today Ubisoft dropped the first trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. It’s only cinematic, so we can’t glean <em>too</em> much about how the game might look during actual gameplay, but it provides a pretty in-depth look at our new protagonists. As previously rumored, Shadows will focus on a male samurai, based on real-life historical figure Yasuke, and a female ninja/shinobi named Naoe. Unlike past dual-protagonist Assassin’s Creed games, the two will play quite differently, with Naoe being about stealth and gadgets, while Yasuke is more of a brawler, wielding heavy weapons. Check out the Assassin’s Creed Shadows cinematic trailer, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official World Premiere Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ developers discussing our new protagonists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Who Are Naoe and Yasuke?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2LH4Ael4X1TlNJY3B3aYg5/assassins-creed-shadows-launches-november-15-features-dual-protagonists-in-feudal-japan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit more detail about both Yasuke and Naoe</a>, and how they relate to one another…</p>
<p><em>"While Naoe and Yasuke play very differently – Naoe is a shinobi who uses stealth, parkour, and gadgets, whereas Yasuke is combat-oriented and armored – the pair’s personalities ultimately complement each other to form a unique dynamic throughout Shadows."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Yasuke: A Real-Life Samurai</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“The decision to include a playable, real-life historical figure of this era in Assassins’ Creed Shadows was two-fold: Ubisoft Quebec wanted to include a Samurai, and Yasuke’s story was open-ended enough to allow for creativity; there are still plenty of questions and speculation surrounding him. The fascinating facts, though, were undisputable: of African origin, he arrived in Japan enslaved by the Portuguese; he impressed with size, strength, and wits; he served under the Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Naoe: The Blade of the People</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“At Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ start, Naoe is a 17-year-old from Iga, and the daughter of one of the era’s most iconic shinobi, Fujibayashi Nagato, who – despite a promise to keep her safe – is forced to train her to be his equal in battle. The team describes Naoe as ‘determined but compassionate,’ capable of taking down any enemy while showing compassion to victims of war and corruption. With her home province of Iga squarely in the path of Nobunaga’s conquest, she sees first-hand the destruction that war can bring, and vows to use her skills to help her people.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFassassinscreedshadows2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>Two Sides of the Same Coin</strong></em></p>
<p><em>“Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ dual protagonists are ultimately brought together by Nobunaga, whose goal of unifying Japan takes his army – and Yasuke – to the province of Iga for the Second Tenshō Iga War. The Igan resistance, though greatly overpowered by Nobunaga’s army, is courageously led by Naoe’s father. The two protagonists find each other through Nobunaga, although, for obvious reasons, they don’t exactly get off to a great start. The pair provide the player with opposing perspectives on Nobunaga and the means he used to achieve his goal of unification, and their overlapping perspectives throughout Shadows ultimately allow for a more nuanced look at the late Sengoku period.</em></p>
<p><em>The difference in their social stature is reflected in the world itself, which will respond differently to the player depending on who they are playing as. Naoe, for example, can present herself as a peasant and garner appropriate reactions; that is, if she wants to be seen at all. Yasuke, on the other hand, comes from a different land, but his status as a samurai garners respect from others, so people will bow to him on the streets. Characters can have different expectations of the pair, and in some cases, will prefer to deal with only one or the other.</em></p>
<p><em>Naoe and Yasuke’s disparate personalities also lead them to have different relationships and rapports with other characters, and they don’t always feel the same way about people, nor do people always feel the same way about them. Romantically, they will also attract and be attracted to different types of people. Through the pair, players will get to experience a multitude of relationships.”</em></p>
<p>In addition to the unique dual-protagonist structure, Ubisoft promises Assassin’s Creed Shadows will include new features, like changing seasons, and a focus on light and shadow during gameplay. Of course, this being an Ubisoft game, there will be multiple purchasing options, including a $70 standard edition, $110 Gold Edition, and $130 Premium Edition. <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders are open now</a>, and all who put their money down get access to the “Thrown to the Dogs” bonus mission. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the special editions…</p>
<p><em><strong>Gold</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Base Game and pre-order bonus</em></li>
<li><em>Season Pass including two story expansions</em></li>
<li><em>3-day early access</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Premium Edition</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Everything included in the Gold Edition, plus…</em></li>
<li><em>The Sekiryu Character Pack including gear and weapon sets for both Naoe and Yasuke, featuring the Sekiryu Beast, and Dragon Tooth trinket.</em></li>
<li><em>The Sekiryu Hideout Pack including four unique ornaments to customize the hideout for your shinobi league.</em></li>
<li><em>Five skill points.</em></li>
<li><em>The Red Dragon filter in Photo mode</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows sneaks onto PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on November 15 of this year. Actual gameplay will be shared at the Ubisoft Forward show in June. What do you think? Are you sharpening your katanas in anticipation?</p>

  <p id="iFGWEf">Ubisoft gave <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/27/16554856/assassins-creed-origins-games-ranked">Assassin’s Creed</a> fans their first real look at the next flagship game in the long-running franchise with the debut trailer for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Wednesday. Previously known as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346013/assassins-creed-red-jade-release-date-announcement-ubisoft-forward-2022-trailer"><em>Assassin’s Creed: Codename Red</em></a>, <em>Shadows</em> will send the franchise to feudal Japan for the first time this November, letting players live out their shinobi fantasies as the ninja Naoe.</p>
<p id="5blCAV"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will also let players take on a second role, that of legendary Black samurai Yasuke. While other Assassin’s Creed games have featured dual protagonists, the two playable characters of <em>Shadows</em> appear to be more distinct than those of any previous game. The game’s female ninja character is shown wielding ninjato, wristblade, and kusarigama, her samurai counterpart is a heavily armored fella with a hefty katana.</p>
<p id="GR2QYV">The debut trailer for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> teased its cinematic ambitions and introduced its characters. Fans may need to wait until <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fforward&amp;sharedid=polygon.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?subId2=[]pl[p]23920674[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026u=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/forward\u0026sharedid=polygon.com&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;subId2&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;subId2&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23920674[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/forward&quot;,&quot;sharedid&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Ubisoft Forward in June</a> for a look at actual gameplay.</p>
<p id="ikYkRP"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind 2018’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/10/1/17920288/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-one-windows-pc"><em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em></a>, under the creative direction of Jonathan Dumont. <em>Shadows</em> was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS_khJE0mbQ">originally announced in 2022</a> under its codename, and promised to send the Assassin’s Creed franchise to one of fans’ most-requested settings.</p>

<p id="g2l8hu"><em>Shadows</em> is the open-world RPG follow-up to last year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23901831/assassins-creed-mirage-review-baghdad-steam-release"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a>, the scaled-back take on the 17-year-old Assassin’s Creed formula. The feudal era Japan-set game is just one of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23727004/new-assassins-creed-sequels-ubisoft">multiple announced projects in the works</a> for the Assassin’s Creed publisher. Others include <em>Assassin’s Creed Jade</em>, a mobile game set in China’s Qin dynasty, and the mysterious <em>Assassin’s Creed Codename: Hexe</em>, “a very different type of Assassin’s Creed game,” according to Ubisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote. <em>Hexe</em> is being overseen by creative director Clint Hocking (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/10/28/21537488/watch-dogs-legion-review-best-characters-skills-play-as-anyone-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-pc"><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/21/17989842/far-cry-2-survival-open-world-npc-permadeath"><em>Far Cry 2</em></a>). </p>

Though the game was pulled from Steam while its previous publisher, Digital Extremes (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/warframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/warframe"><em>Warframe</em></a></span>), was transferring the rights to developer Airship, it is set to land on the storefront again on June 11 with a massive new content update called Echoes. The biggest news, however, is that this update and relaunch will see <em>Wayfinder</em> abandon its previous microtransactions, as well as the always-online model, and shift to being a one-time purchase, early access title.</p><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196742" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>After <em>Wayfinder</em>’s previous publisher, Digital Extremes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut its external publishing arm</a></span> late last year, things looked grim for the online action-RPG. Having barely survived its turbulent early access launch, the developers at Airship Syndicate had to suddenly take over publishing <em>Wayfinder</em>, which involved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/playwayfinder/status/1777389335232270630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/playwayfinder/status/1777389335232270630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporarily delisting the game</a></span> earlier this year and hoping its small-but-dedicated fanbase wouldn’t turn on it before the studio could bring it back better than ever. Now, though, <em>Wayfinder </em>appears to be coming back with “a more <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-games-2023-delisted-servers-offline-1850083031">sustainable business model</a></span> for Airship moving forward.”</p><p>Launching on June 11th, the Echoes update and relaunch of <em>Wayfinder</em> on Steam will rip out all of the game’s microtransactions, making it so that anything (like armor, characters, weapons, etc.) that was previously purchasable can now be gained in-game. To make up for that change, <em>Wayfinder</em>, which was free-to-play when it first launched, will now be priced at $24.99 while it is in early access, though the price will rise when it comes out of it later this fall.</p><p>According to Airship’s president Ryan Stefanelli, “We’ve seen a shift in the industry where players are OK paying for a premium title if it means respect for their time and wallets. It’s one we prefer ourselves, frankly, and we believe it’ll make the game much easier for people to enjoy.” Stefanelli is more than likely referring to games such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span>, which all launched in early access and fully released to acclaim and huge financial success. Reps at Larian have gone on the record saying that early access was instrumental in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s success and that the studio is likely to go the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-game-early-access-1851392180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-new-game-early-access-1851392180"> same route for its next game</a></span>. <em>Hades 2</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155">just launched in early access</a></span> last week, is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841">pulling in even greater numbers</a></span> than the first game. When done right, the move has obviously paid dividends.</p><p>Players who previously purchased <em>Wayfinder </em>on Steam can begin playing the Echoes update when it “soft launches” on May 31, and new players can jump in and buy the game on June 11, when it officially releases. PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 players are able to continue playing <em>Wayfinder </em>until the Echoes update drops on PS5 later in the summer, at which point the PS4 version of the game will stop being supported. All existing PS4 versions of the game will be automatically updated to PS5 for free, though. <em>Wayfinder </em>will also be coming to Xbox systems when it comes out of early access in the fall.</p><p>The other major change the Echoes update will introduce is the removal of <em>Wayfinder</em>’s MMO-lite online experience. Though it was never truly an MMO, <em>Wayfinder</em> featured an always-online component that randomly placed folks into servers with a number of other players, not unlike <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span>. Now though, <em>Wayfinder</em> will have an offline mode <em>as well as </em>the option to play cooperatively with up to two other players, which it always featured. This change seems like it should make the game more stable and, as the announcement post suggests, “allows for gameplay on devices like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-cute-puppy-dog-chewed-destroyed-reddit-1851413853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-cute-puppy-dog-chewed-destroyed-reddit-1851413853">Steam Deck</a></span> and home PCs,” where it’s previously struggled.</p><p>The Echoes update will also bring new content that Airship has been working on, including a new region, a new playable character named Grendel, and a number of new hunts. It also reworks various systems and introduces others to <em>Wayfinder </em>to accommodate for the shift from a microtransaction-ridden live-service title to a premium early access game, such as “randomized weapon drops, armor with variable stats, and an easier process for acquiring new characters,” as well as traditional RPG features like a talent system and much needed quality-of-life changes like four difficulty levels.</p><p>I fell for <em>Wayfinder </em>after taking a preview at PAX East last year, and am actually really happy to see all of these changes come to the game. When it finally did release last summer, the game was a mess, which turned me off to playing it. Instead, I spent the next few months watching the player count dwindle and seeing the game become the butt of jokes before Digital Extremes unceremoniously cut ties with it. Though there’s no telling if this will <em>actually </em>be the triumphant comeback of <em>Wayfinder</em>, Airship’s messaging is at least far more assured than it’s ever been before, and the promise of a more stable game and model for both the developers and players is more than enough to win me over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has officially been revealed through an energetic, mysterious, and jaw-dropping cinematic trailer that also confirmed the game will be released on November 15, 2024. It’s a dual-protagonist game set in the heart of Feudal Japan, with players getting the option to switch between a Shinobi (Ninja) and a Samurai.</p>



<p>Following the release of the trailer, all Assassin’s Creed Shadows editions were revealed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bang-for-your-buck">Bang For Your Buck</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is one of the most highly anticipated games of the year. It’s set to be a monumental iteration of the legendary series, particularly as fans have been requesting an Assassin’s Creed title set in Japan for several years. While Assassin’s Creed Mirage scratched an itch last year, it has been almost four years since players sunk their teeth into an epic, large-scale AC title.</p>



<p>That’s where Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes in. Here are the editions that are <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/game/?lang=en_US&amp;pid=660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd&amp;dwvar_660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd_Platform=pcdl&amp;edition=null&amp;source=detail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available to pre-order now</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Standard Edition </strong>($69.99): Base Game and Pre-Order Bonus (Thrown to the Dogs Quest)</li>



<li><strong>Gold Edition </strong>($109.99): Base Game, Thrown to the Dogs Quest, Season Pass, 3 Days Early Access</li>



<li><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong> ($129.99): Base Game, Thrown to the Dogs Quest, Season Pass, 3 Days Early Access, and Ultimate Pack including gear and weapon sets, skill points, and photomode filters</li>
</ul>



<p>It was confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will only be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, effectively making Assassin’s Creed Mirage the last AC title to be released on the last generation of home consoles.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has released the first trailer for the upcoming Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. In addition to the trailer, <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a17fbff4e2940488bce.html?lang=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio also confirmed</a> that the game will launch on November 15.</p>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch below, gives a first look at the game’s two protagonists — Naoe and Yasuke. </p>



<p>“In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend,” the game’s description reads. “Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan.</p>



<p>“From chaos to purpose, from darkness to light. A new Creed rises over Japan.”</p>



<p>The first deep dive into Assassin’s Creed: Shadows gameplay is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-gameplay-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected at Ubisoft Forward</a> on June 10. There will also be hands-on opportunities at Summer Games Fest with an embargo lifting on June 12.</p>



<p>When it releases, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It’ll be the first game in a decade <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-be-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to not release on Xbox One</a> or PlayStation 4.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the Gold or Ultimate Edition of the game — or are a member of Ubisoft+ — you can get three days early access starting November 12.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>While it might seem like a brand new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> map is random, there's a lot of math happening under the hood to ensure that mountains look like mountains, rivers look like rivers, and jungles don't bump up against icy tundra. Because Minecraft seeds are predictable, you can do a lot of stuff with them, like restarting the same base Minecraft world on a new server or sharing them with your friends. One of the most useful things you can do, though, is use the seed information to generate a <strong>seed map</strong>. In this guide, we'll learn what a seed is, how to find it, and just what you can do with a seed map. </p><h2 dir="ltr">What is a Seed?</h2><p dir="ltr">As we hinted above, Minecraft maps are not truly random or infinite. There are about 18.4 quintillion possible seeds that you could plug into Minecraft for different worlds. Some will be very similar, others will be wildly different. This is not coincidentally the same number of planets in No Man's Sky. These numbers are generated using a 64-bit number space, which starts at 0 and goes all the way up to, you guessed it, 18.4 quintillion, or 264.</p><p dir="ltr">Minecraft uses a complex algorithm to make sure you're getting as few random floating blocks or out-of-place objects as possible, and the seed, in essence, tells Minecraft what math problem to do to generate your world.</p><p dir="ltr">What you do with the world <em>after</em> that seed is generated is not relevant here--it's not a save state of your Minecraft world. This isn't a "million monkeys, million typewriters" situation, either; there isn't a seed out there that has the exact wooden hut you built the first time you played Minecraft, and these are quite different from Minecraft world saves, which can get into multiple gigabytes of space if you commit yourself to exploring a single world.</p><p dir="ltr">That seed number will always generate that world, though, with the caveat that there have been some shifts in how Minecraft uses seed numbers and how Bedrock and Java versions of Minecraft use the same seed number--though the two versions are mostly the same these days. seed maps will vary from one version of Minecraft to another as Mojang changes how the worlds are generated. For example, a seed in Minecraft 1.14, released in 2019, won't account for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-next-update-adds-cherry-blossoms/1100-6511488/">Cherry Grove biome</a> introduced in 1.20.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How do I find my Minecraft Seed?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two primary ways to view the seed for your Minecraft world. First, you'll need to know what platform and version you're on. Those are right on the main screen; it'll say Java or Bedrock right under the Minecraft logo, and the version number is located in the bottom left corner. It doesn't matter whether you're playing on Xbox, PC, iOS, or other platforms; these should not affect your world seed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png" data-ref-id="1300-4303145" data-ratio="0.52734375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png" data-ref-id="1300-4303145"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303145-minecraft-seed-location.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can find your seed on Minecraft Java by hitting Enter and typing /seed. To find the seed on a local world stored on your machine, go to Settings, Game Settings, and find Seed. If you're playing Minecraft on an official realm or a dedicated server, you may have to download a copy of your world and load it locally to do so.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is a seed map?</h2><p dir="ltr">Okay, so we know what a Minecraft Seed is and a general idea of how they work (that doesn't require understanding and discussing complex math). So what is a seed <em>map</em>? It's right there in the name--a map of your Minecraft world, generated using your Minecraft world's seed number.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same way that a Minecraft Seed doesn't account for the changes you make after generation, a seed map is no replacement for a proper <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-navigational-tools-guide-navigating-your-way-through-minecraft/1100-6495738/">in-game map</a>, which will reflect the changes you've made and can even track where you are. It's more like an Atlas than a GPS.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where can I view seed maps?</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a bunch of different ways to view Minecraft seed maps. As you think about clicking these, please note that none of these sites are officially affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang, Microsoft, or GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">A good seed map viewer will let you choose which platform (Bedrock or Java) and version (1.20, 1.22, and so on) of Minecraft you're playing on to account for the variations in how seeds work from version to version. Further, though, these maps will indicate the locations of things like Woodland Mansions, Underwater Temples, and Ancient Cities, as well as villages, and basic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-biomes-guide-what-makes-each-biome-special/1100-6495691/">biome</a> locations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303146" data-ratio="0.76239907727797" data-width="867" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303146"></a><figcaption>Chunkbase.com</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4303146-chunkbase.jpg"></figure><p>One of our favorite options for viewing Minecraft seed maps is the seed map Viewer at <a href="https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map" rel="nofollow ">Chunkbase</a>. Another solid option is <a href="http://mcseedmap.net/" rel="nofollow ">MCseedmap.net</a>. Both sites offer filtering for version, dimension (Overworld, Nether, The End), and for all biomes and landmarks.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're playing on iOS or keep an iOS device near you, you can install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cartographer-for-minecraft/id1642956379" rel="nofollow ">Cartographer for Minecraft</a>. If you're tech-savvy and want to view your map in an offline application, independent developers have created things like <a href="https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer" rel="nofollow ">Cubiomes Viewer</a>. The technical barrier to entry on that last one is much, much higher than any of the other options presented above, so keep that in mind as you go in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How do I use a seed map?</h2><p dir="ltr">When using a Minecraft seed map, the only limit is yourself. If you've imagined yourself setting up home base in a spruce forest, you can use a seed map to find the spruce forest nearest your spawn point. If you're trying to find an End Portal to take down the Ender Dragon, a seed map will help you find that. If you need to find your way back to an exact set of coordinates and want a visual guide, you can input your current coordinates to see where you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you open this Pandora's Box of Minecraft information, remember that Minecraft is about exploration as much as it is about building. If you want to preserve the sense of mystery in your Minecraft world, think twice before using a seed map. On the other hand, if you're trying to accomplish something specific and you don't want to spend dozens of hours searching for the landmark that gets you the item you need, a seed map is a perfect way to get there with minimal fuss.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows, the next game in Ubisoft's long-running action-adventure series, is scheduled to launch November 15, just a little over a year after Assassin's Creed Mirage. And as confirmed by the new cinematic reveal trailer, you can play Shadows three days earlier if you're paying $18 a month for <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-possible-protagonists-launches-november-15%2F1100-6523473%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Plus' Premium Plan</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the trailer does not confirm it, it seems like Shadows will feature two playable protagonists: Yasuke and an unnamed Japanese woman. As we see both characters working together, the implication is that you'll play as both of them, either quickly switching between the two within the same mission or switching after big story beats--the latter, of which, has big Assassin's Creed Syndicate vibes. And that would track, seeing as Ubisoft Quebec, the studio that helmed development of Syndicate (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-assassins-creed-game-ranked/2900-4916/">the best Assassin's Creed game</a>), is the developer lead for Shadows.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Initially codenamed Project Red, Shadows was already confirmed to take place in feudal Japan, but the cinematic trailer narrows the when even further to the Edo period, which occurred between 1603 and 1868 and saw Japan united under the Tokugawa shogunate. The trailer features one of the presumably two playable protagonists talking about "unification," which points to Edo.</p><p dir="ltr">The other possible main character is Yasuke, an African samurai who served during the end of the Sengoku period--the period that directly preceded Edo. So it seems like Shadows takes place during the early years of the Edo period.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303425" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303425"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303425-acshadows1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303426,1300-4303427,1300-4303428,1300-4303429,1300-4303430" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303426-acshadows2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303427-acshadows3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303428-acshadows4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303429-acshadows5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4303430-acshadows6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of how the protagonist-switching works, it seems like playing as Yasuke offers a more action-oriented combat experience similar to Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla while the Japanese woman is geared more toward the social stealth gameplay of Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate. This further suggests that you'll play as both characters, rather than pick one or the other at the start and stick with them for the full story (like Kassandra and Alexios in Odyssey, who are gameplay mirrors of each other). The conclusion of the trailer also sees both characters reference the Creed of the Assassin Brotherhood, which indicates that they both are inducted into the order and are subsequently both important.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC, Mac, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-reveal-trailer-confirms-dual-samurai-and-shinobi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/assassins-creed-shadows-formerly-known-as-codename-red-gets-world-premiere-this-week">teasing its reveal earlier this week</a>, Ubisoft has officially unveiled <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> with its first cinematic trailer, revealing dual protagonists in the process. As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.</p>

<p>This dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-odyssey/fighting-for-glory">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>&nbsp;– but it's exciting nonetheless. According to the game's PlayStation preorder page, players can, "Switch seamlessly between two unlikely allies as you discover their common destiny," confirming you can control both in the story. The trailer also showcases the beauty and scale of the feudal Japan we'll be exploring in Shadows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Assassin's Creed Shadows reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nszrx939ZVA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Elsewhere in the game's PlayStation preorder listing, Ubisoft says players can explore the "captivating open world of feudal Japan, from spectacular castle towns and bustling ports to peaceful shrines and war-ravaged landscapes," while adventuring through unpredictable weather, changing seasons, and reactive environments. The changing seasons line seems to indicate the narrative of Shadows could take place over a long period of time, or at least a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a shinobi Assassin, Naoe uses stealth to avoid detection and agility to confuse enemies whereas Yasuke, a legendary samurai, uses lethal precision and power. You unlock new skills, gear, and progression independently for each character. Plus, as you explore the world, you can create your own network of spies to be your eyes and ears across Japan, and different allies will have unique skills to help you accomplish missions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Create a fully customizable hideout for your growing shinobi league as you train your crew, craft new gear, interact with key characters, and choose your base's layouts, decorations, and accessories," the preorder listing reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's another look at Yasuke and Naoe</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shadows is an exciting entry in the sprawling Assassin's Creed series. It's finally bringing players to feudal Japan, something the fanbase has wanted for years and years, and it's the next open-world mainline RPG installment since 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-a-saga-worthy-of-song">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-animation-should-have-weird-songs.871803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/home-movies-bobs-burgers-songs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, I was burning some scones that are still good because they’re <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1538798/buckwheat-rhubarb-scones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scones</a> while playing <em>Home Movies</em> in the background. <em>Home Movies</em>, if you don’t know, was an Adult Swim cartoon that ran from 2001 to 2004, by creators who would go on to make animated shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Metalocalypse. </em>If you ask me, it was the best show on television, especially the musical episodes, which more cartoons should learn from.</p><p>I constantly assume that everybody remembers the existence of <em>Home Movies </em>and can quote all of its best jokes, but looking up details about it for this blog reminded me that it was relatively short-lived and pretty niche. (Back when Netflix was just DVDs, I actually signed up for it solely to watch <em>Home Movies</em>.)&nbsp; It might be something of a cult classic, but its vibes persist to this day in the semi-improvised humor of co-creator Loren Bouchard’s shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>; I can’t hear the deadpan presentation and hilarious tendency to drag a conversation out one sentence too long in the performances of animation mainstay H. Jon Benjamin without thinking of his role as <em>Home Movies</em>’ Coach McGuirk. <em>Home Movies </em>itself shares a pedigree with another show you might not remember, <em>Dr. Katz Professional Therapist</em>, whose “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squigglevision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squigglevision</a>” animation style defined <em>Home Movies</em>’ first season.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Home Movies</em> follows three elementary school kids–Brendon, Jason, and Melissa–who make strange, pretentious movies in their basement after school. They take their work overly seriously, and they grapple with adult artist issues like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlI1FWmh0r8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work-life balance</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUhR2pvsemk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding</a>, and accepting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxOfOxxCPM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feedback</a>. The movies themselves are usually hilarious and weird, classic film genres or tropes misinterpreted through the eyes of kids, and their content often has something to do with whatever is happening in the kids’ outside lives.&nbsp;</p><p>As Erik Adams wrote at <a href="https://www.avclub.com/before-tv-revivals-happened-every-day-adult-swim-turne-1826075574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The AV Club</a> (in an article that kept me from writing <em>this</em> article for years because he said everything I’d say better than me, and which caused me to shout, “Fuck you, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/mr-autumn-man-onion-1848664821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Autumn Man</a>!” at my desk),&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Behind the camera, Brendon has a preternatural eye, but he lacks an intuitive grasp of the world around him. His naïveté is important to <em>Home Movies</em>, because it shields him from some harsh realities. It’s a deeply funny show, but one with a melancholy streak below its surface: There’s always a sense that the world as Brendon has seen it on screen has failed him, his peers, and the people who raise them… <em>Home Movies</em>’ depiction of childhood doesn’t give in to nostalgia. Brendon’s life is not made easier by the fact that he’s still in elementary school, nor is that elementary school any sort of respite from the chaos and uncertainty of his day-to-day life. The show’s humor is wrapped up in the kids being both innocent and wise beyond their years, but they can be cruel and petty beyond their years, too [.]</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>You can read Erik’s article to get a good overview of where you should start with the show, which you can watch as part of the Adult Swim catalogue on HBO while being crushed by the fear that Warner Bros. will one day decide to <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1316517/space-ghost-coast-to-coast-removed-from-max-fans-are-furious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">axe it</a>. There isn’t much of an overarching plot, so I’d encourage you in particular to check out some of the episodes that feature music.</p><p>The pinnacle of this, if you ask me, is the season 1 episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Director’s Cut</a>,” which features the kids’ teen friend Dwayne, who makes the music for their movies, asking them to film a rock opera he’s written that blends a biography of Franz Kafka with Kafka’s book <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. What we see of the rock opera is ambitious and a bit nonsensical, but catchy as hell; the lyric “He grew up very poor, he’s fearless to the core/ Born in 1883 died in 1924” used to reduce an old boyfriend of mine and me to tears whenever we randomly recalled it. The episode’s subplot is that Brendon, jealous of Dwayne, wants instead to make a movie imagining if Louis Pasteur and Louis Braille met, the joke being that they’re both French inventors named Louis. Both works show a kid’s misunderstanding of historical figures that is hilarious as an adult, but also takes the whole concept of “great men” down a peg.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Franz Kafka - Rock Opera" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uaaF83eVig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Other episodes aren’t as straightforwardly musicals as “Director’s Cut” but feature some great songs, including the songs in season 2’s episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808675/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">History</a>” as part of the kids’ action movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj0M0RY_XXs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starboy &amp; The Captain of Outer Space</em></a><em> </em>and the song in season 1’s “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808684/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortgages and Marbles</a>” about not putting marbles in your nose.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Home Movies 111 - Don't put marbles in your nose" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpz67hBIJwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But I think <em>Home Movies</em> comes into its own both musically and in its art style in the fourth and final season, which opens with a slew of musical-inflected episodes. The second episode, “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0603598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camp</a>,” sees the kids go to a performing arts camp, where they’re sure their talents will be recognized. Instead, they’re insulted by their counsellors and put in a bit of a loser troop, which is overseen by music counsellors Dwayne alongside Mike and Miguel, voiced by They Might Be Giants’ John Flansburgh and John Linnell. The actual best part of the episode is probably the subplot about McGuirk escaping a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v12F0bZkJ4E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men’s empowerment retreat</a> in the woods (“We will walk through the forest and we will look at the treetops and we will cry”), but the episode also features some hilarious songs by the music counsellors. “What’s up guys, I got here late” remains a lyric I sing to myself whenever anyone shows up late for a meeting I’m at.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Camp Campingston Falls!! (They Might Be Giants/Home Movies Compilation)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHWtfykeuBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Camp” is followed by “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808663/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bye Bye Greasy</a>,” where Brendon is directing a school musical that combines the vibes of <em>Grease</em> and <em>Bye Bye Birdie </em>into a plot I still could not summarize despite having seen the episode countless times. All the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QKyeAfyNJk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">songs</a> are great, but the highlight for me is McGuirk’s weird, nonsensical song after he disastrously drives his car on-stage. “Bye Bye Greasy” is such a good sendup of teen-focused musicals, capturing their overly serious emotions and weird stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="McGuirk in Bye Bye Greasy" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpzjLtzuk1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’d be remiss to not call out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVs1DJdemeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever the hell the musical is supposed to be</a> in “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808696/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wizard’s Baker</a>” and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64kRvkv_ntw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tommy</em> sendup</a> in “<a href="https://homemovies.fandom.com/wiki/Temporary_Blindness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Temporary Blindness</a>,” but the other season 4 standout for me has always been the Simon &amp; Garfunkel-esque rendition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHDpw1V8c_w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monster theme song</a> the kids’ friend Fenton writes for the monster movie they’re making. The nonsense lyrics and how much fun it is to hear the word “Septopus” brings a kids’ lens to the episode’s actually pretty heavy plot about how to end relationships that aren’t working for you.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="septopus" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gr6jvT3d-UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Home Movies</em>’ musical legacy has lived on in the subsequent work of its creators; obviously in Small’s work on <em>Metalocalypse</em>, but also in Bouchard’s shows <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Central Park.</em> I didn’t fall in love with <em>Central Park</em>, an Apple TV show about a New York City park ranger, but I was hugely impressed with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkurx96dA2Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitiously </a>scored and animated musical numbers, perhaps a no-brainer for a show whose cast includes Leslie Odom Jr. and Daveed Diggs from <em>Hamilton </em>and Josh Gad from <em>The Book of Mormon</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Central Park</em> is unabashedly a musical, <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> is practically one as well (I have no proof of this, but have always sort of seen <em>Central Park</em> as a place for Bouchard to live out his musical ambitions outside of the narrative confines of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>). The most <em>Home Movies</em>-like song is probably the Thomas Edison musical from the episode “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2733872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Topsy</a>,”&nbsp; which feels like a clear reference to the Kafka musical to me. But there’s also the hilarious oeuvre of the show’s boy band<a href="https://bobs-burgers.fandom.com/wiki/Boyz4Now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Boys 4 Now</a>, Gene’s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luDto63LDlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Die Hard/Working Girl</em></a><em> </em>musical, and the songs that play over each episode’s credits, which I always stick around for.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob's Burgers - Topsy" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypqSHg1YvZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As someone who thinks all shows should be musicals, and also that all shows should be animated, I love all this. And since shows like <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> and <em>Home Movies</em> aren’t strictly musicals like <em>Central Park</em> or Disney movies, their songs don’t have to be confined to big plot moments. Instead, they can be off-hand jokes or small soundtracks; as <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMOa-HYQpcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEMZwkDJIk4&amp;list=PLwFhE2bl8ckcXVp95hLRrEoVfKBpxPji7&amp;index=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notes</a>, it’s fun to just break into song whenever you feel like. I imagine that many of us&nbsp; (or <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/683723209305374720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe just me</a>?) have little songs we sing to ourselves to brighten up our days or help us remember things.&nbsp;</p><p>More musical numbers in everything, please, but especially in animation. Or in the comments below, which I expect you to fill with examples.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Airship Syndicate has announced that its MMO Wayfinder will become a single player, with co-op options, offline game called Wayfinder Echoes. Sales for Wayfinder were stopped in April when the game’s ownership transferred from Digital Extremes to Airship Syndicate, while those who owned the game could play as normal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayfinder - Extended Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkN0faBRyjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Wayfinder Echoes will be available from June 11th on Steam, and it will remove all online requirements for the game, including not needing an account and log in to play. It will also be Steam Deck verified. Any progress people have made in the original Wayfinder will not carry forward to Wayfinder Echoes due to saves not being on a server any longer. There will be no in game purchases or microtransactions either, with Wayfinder Echoes having a price of $24.99 while in early access, and this price will increase when the game leaves early access. Founders Packs will not be going back on sale either. Those who purchased Runesilver will have this converted to a new in game currency that can be used on exclusive cosmetics. The update will be soft launched on May 31st.</p>
<p>Wayfinder Echoes gameplay has also been tweaked and changed. Airship Syndicate have said,<em>“We’ve touched every major system in the game, and as a result, the gameplay is not only more refined, but through our various playtests with those outside the studio, the game performs and plays better than before. Some of these changes include all weapons becoming randomized drops with various slots, armor now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional RPG talents into your progression, and much more. This update will also launch with the latest Wayfinder: Grendel, as well as brand-new Hunts and a new Overlands zone (three times the size of our last!) that’s overflowing with content and points of interest.”</em></p>

<p>PS4 support for Wayfinder will be ending but everyone who bought a PS4 version will get a copy of the PS5 version for no cost. The PS5 version of Wayfinder will not go back on sale until later this year, along with an Xbox Series X|S version.</p>

		<p>Tango Gameworks has released one last patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> today, the final act of the studio after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">the announcement of its closure</a> by Microsoft last week.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the end of the story for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-xbox-game/">the award-winning game</a>, as it’s been re-confirmed that a physical edition of Hi-Fi Rush is still coming via Limited Run Games. Announced back in February, this will be available for both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>. Some have noted that this will likely be the one real way to preserve the game’s legacy, thanks to the licensed soundtrack meaning it will likely end up removed from sale in a few years – there are non-licensed alternatives in a Streamer mode, but without Tango being around to modify the game as licenses expire, Microsoft is likely to simply pull the game from sale, as it does with its Forza games.</p>


<p>“Thank you all for your continued support.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">team writes on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re working to release the physical edition of Hi-Fi RUSH with our partners at Limited Run Games, as well as a final patch to address some minor issues releasing later today.”</p>
<p>Patch notes have been released for these “minor issues”, and they really do seem quite minor. Here’s the Hi-Fi Rush Update 9 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5 AND PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) After reducing QA-1MIL to zero health, a collision issue would occur where players would fall out of the geometry. Chai will now properly fall to the ground, instead of into the abyss.</li>
<li>(Track 01) Fixed an issue during the latter half of the 2D area whereby the camera would not follow Chai when the elevating lift falls.</li>
<li>(Track 02) Corrected a defect whereby if you touched Rekka during her electric charge, your final Rank would not correlate with the Chorus score.</li>
<li>Some issues would occur when trying to use Macaron’s Gravity Well while Rhythm Parrying an enemy. Well, this is now fixed!</li>
<li>(Track 03) Cutscenes previously would not play correctly if a Health Tank was consumed during the fight with the HG-0G. Feel free to block a few more hits with your face because this bug is fixed!</li>
<li>Fixed various text issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) During the “Dodge Attack” tutorial, there was a discrepancy between what Smidge said and the text. The text will .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) We also QA’d some other issues during the QA-1MIL fight, particularly around transitions between phases.</li>
<li>Fixed even more text bugs! They just don’t stop!</li>
