		<p>Having already faced several delays ahead of a planned Early Access release, Paradox Interactive has now delayed their The Sims rival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-by-you">Life By You</a>&nbsp;indefinitely.</p>
<p>Where previous delays had been accompanied by a video, this latest delay has been done with a simple statement on the Paradox Interactive website:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th. This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.</p>
<p>While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.</p>
<p>We will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.</p>
<p>Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developed by Paradox Tectonic, a team led by The Sims veteran Rod Humble, Life By You is an ambitious attempt to take on the life sim juggernaut that is The Sims.</p>
<p>Life By You would naturally cover all of the main bases of the genre, but Paradox Tectonic planned to go even further by adding a far deeper degree of customisation and control for the player. You’ll be able to build your person’s home, with ingrained customisation for colour palettes and designs, and then guide your humans through life, through careers, love and more. You’ll be able to take direct control of people (any person in the world) and move them in the world, and be able to engage in contextually generated conversations with other people. Pretty much all of this can then be modded, from creating custom styles to writing your own dialogue, create events, items, shops, careers, skills, traits and more.</p>

<p>It’s very ambitious in that regard, and seems that Paradox Tectonic need longer to make all of this hang together. Early Access releases were once synonymous with very early builds of games that were severely lacking in features, but as time has gone by, expectations for what an Early Access release offers have grown – not least when it’s a fairly large publisher using this business model. With the quality of Paradox’s game launches currently very much in the spotlight, it makes sene to hold off until Life By You and meet as many expectations as possible.</p>

            <p>An intrepid Super Mario 64 player with far more skill and patience than I can ever hope to obtain has done the once unthinkable. They have completed the game without pressing the A button - you know, the one that makes Mario jump and therefore is pretty darn useful when navigating the platform and enemy laden world - once. Not one single time. Really.</p>
<p>While Super Mario 64 first released in 1996, the <a href="https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/A_Button_Challenge">Super Mario 64 A Button Challenge</a> started picking up traction in the 2000s. And, while there have been many attempts at completing the game without that pretty essential button, no one has managed to complete the game without using A. Until now.</p>

<p>This Super Mario 64 feat was achieved a couple of days ago by a streamer known as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marbler">Marbler</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/for-the-first-time-in-28-years-super-mario-64-has-been-beaten-without-using-the-a-button-and-it-only-took-86-hours/">GamesRadar</a>). Thanks to a number of glitches, secrets (like green shells and air currents) and countless heroic dives, Marbler managed to complete the world's first no A button run on the Wii Virtual Console version of the game. Apparently this is the only version that it is actually possible to complete the game without pressing A. They did not remap any buttons to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>You can see the moment Marbler completes their Super Mario 64 A button challenge in the video below. Is this something you fancy trying out for yourself?</p>

<p>Super Mario 64 has had quite the month. Along with this week's achievement, earlier in May, an unopenable door in Super Mario 64 - which was thought to be impenetrable from the outside without the use of mods - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-27-years-super-mario-64s-last-remaining-locked-door-has-finally-been-opened">was finally opened</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder what else the community will achieve before Super Mario 64 turns 30 (which, honestly, I am still trying to wrap my head around, because I am still only 21...).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-60fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ryujinx, one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last remaining major Nintendo Switch emulators</a>, is already able to run today's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake at 60FPS.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is out today for the Nintendo Switch, but those owning the Remake's ROM were already able to successfully run and play the game on PC through the Ryujinx Switch emulator. Not only that, but the emulator managed to run the game at 60FPS, whereas, on Nintendo's platform, the game is locked at 30FPS. In addition, the game runs in higher resolutions on PC than on the Switch. We've included a video of Ryujinx running the game emulated on PC below (courtesy of '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2IhbStna8E&amp;amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reznoire</a>') below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Ryujinx 1.1.1319 3xIR | Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (60fps Mod) Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2IhbStna8E?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As most of you will know, this isn't the first time that a Switch title is playable on PC on launch day - as a matter of fact, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-wonder-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Super Mario Wonder</a> could already be played ahead of their global Switch release.</p>
<p>In other Paper Mario-related news - as covered earlier today - <a href="https://wccftech.com/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-4k-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's remake seemingly contains a 4K performance profile</a>, which might be related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's upcoming Switch successor</a>.</p>
<p>As said, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Remake is out today for the Nintendo Switch. Here's what we wrote about the game in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review from earlier today:</a></p>
<p><em>"While the new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door preserves the gonzo charm that made the original game a cult classic, not a lot has been done to deal with its padding and other design quirks. If you’re a hardcore Thousand-Year Door fan, worry not, you’re going to love this spiffy new version. If you’re new to the game or weren’t entirely sold the first time around, you’re still likely to find plenty to enjoy here, but you may also notice a few tattered edges."</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-might-a-playstation-controller-look-like-10-years-from-now-sony-has-an-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>What will playing a video game look like 10 years from now? Will video games be something we beam directly into our brains? Or will be still be gaming in front of a big television, monitor, or mobile much as we do today?</p><p>In a new <a href="https://youtu.be/mq7Jg_1hGTo?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Sony has imagined what a PlayStation controller might look like 10 years from now, and it's something straight out of Star Trek.</p><p>"Sony’s Creative Entertainment Vision" YouTube video showed a number of designs for futuristic devices including a gaming controller. Now, while Sony makes a point of saying the content in this video is not directly related to any existing Sony product, it’s fun to imagine playing a video game with this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/screenshot-2024-05-23-112707-1716460830447.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The image shows a PlayStation controller connected to what looks like a floating and curved screen. Is the screen merely a projection from the controller, or an actual physical screen that floats in space, perhaps via the power of magnets? Sony doesn’t explain, and it doesn’t have to. This isn’t a prototype, just a fanciful imagination brought to life with special effects.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb on the video:</p><blockquote>10 years from now, we will be living in a more multi-layered world where physical and virtual realities overlap without boundaries. If Sony, as a creative entertainment company, would be filling the world with new Kando in that future, what kind of experiential value would we be offering to make that happen? </blockquote><blockquote>To explore this question, we conducted a prototyping exercise under the concept of “Creative Entertainment Vision.” Envisioning through the lens of Sony’s creativity and technology, here we present the future as an extension of our lives today.</blockquote><p>Reaction to the controller is a mix of disbelief and mockery, with some likening it to real-life PlayStation prototypes that never saw the light of day, such as the unreleased PS3 controller affectionately called the '<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/01/the-boomerang-what-might-have-been">Boomerang</a>.'</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/what-if-sony-stuck-with-the-ps3s-boomerang-controller-20081201033209544-000-1716461081594.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It’s all a bit of fun, of course, but let’s entertain the idea for a moment. In a decade from now, so in 2034, we will perhaps be on the PlayStation 7 generation, assuming Sony is still pumping out consoles. But perhaps Sony will have gone down the hybrid console route, ala Nintendo Switch, by then. All you’d need to game on the go is a lightweight controller, looking something like the controller we see in the video, that projects a screen to look at wherever you are. Perhaps PS7 <em>is</em> the controller.</p><p>Which Call of Duty will we be on by then? That’s quick math I can’t quite wrap my head around. As long as the ping is low and the k/d high, I’ll be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Back in the world of the present, Sony is reportedly preparing to release a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online">PS5 Pro</a>, and last year it released the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a> peripheral. Maybe we should take the PlayStation Portal and this video as a hint that PlayStation’s future is wherever we want to take it.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Co-founders discuss their plans to create a sustainable company and how they want to champion indie developers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega veterans Jarvis Crofts, Luke Greenaway, and Mark Dallamore have formed a new publisher-agency hybrid, Alibi.</p>
<p>Based in London, Alibi draws on the three co-founders' experiences in data analytics, publishing, and more to help support developers in pitching and publishing games.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>spoke with two of its founders, CEO Jarvis Crofts and CSO Luke Greenaway, about the formation of Alibi and why they believe a publisher agency hybrid is a sustainable way forward in the industry.</p>
<p>Alibi formed at the beginning of last year after Greenaway looked back at his time working in the music industry. He noted the importance of scouting in that industry, and wondered why it wasn't of bigger importance in games.</p>
<p>"You live and die by the success of your titles, the same way record labels do with their artists," he notes. "I had that idea in my head for a while, and when I left PTW I thought, 'You know what, I'm going to build this out."</p>

</figure>
<p>"It's obviously incredibly challenging because there is no science to making successful games, and I think publishers struggle to be sustainable because innately they almost feel like hedge funds," Greenaway continues. "You have to have a quantity to balance the successes from those that aren't going to succeed. And I think the way we looked at it was actually, you can do this better."</p>
<p>Crofts, Greenaway, and Dallamore have over fifteen years of experience in the games industry. Crofts worked as a data analyst at Sega for a decade, moving from a junior to senior position on the publishing side before moving to Curve Games to head up portfolio and strategy.</p>
<p>Dallamore worked at Sega for six years as a project lead and product launch executive, with experience in product development. Greenaway worked in QA for fifteen years before moving outside the industry working in music software and business development. He then came back to work for PTW as director of commercial strategy.</p>
<p>Greenaway adds that publishing is high risk, which is why he wants Alibi to stay small and to be selective about the developers it works with and the games it signs. That way, the team can pour their focus onto a select few and help them succeed. So far, Greenaway says that the developers they've spoken with have been "very receptive" to that.</p>
<p>"Our approach is that we're not necessarily pursuing representation super proactively – it's more of an emergent thing," Crofts adds. "Our objective first and foremost is to meet great developers. If there's a great game there and a mutual desire for us to work together, we'll ensure there's a way for us to work together no matter what.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>"So if we can sign a title and publish it, brilliant, let's do it. If our slate is full but the team wants to work with us, we can help represent or consult them, help them self-publish and get this stuff built up. It's really about maximising and being really efficient with the limited focus that we have."</p>
<p>Greenaway agrees that efficiency is the key to being sustainable in this industry, which Crofts says is at the core of what they hope to achieve with Alibi.</p>
<p>"If you're speaking to a developer and you don't sign a game, you've still invested a lot of time and resources into that negotiation," he explains. "Whereas for us, we can pivot into representation and consultancy and maintain that relationship and still generate revenue. But, more importantly, we can help a developer take their game to market through publishing partners."</p>
<p>For Crofts, this is what sets Alibi apart in such a competitive space among other publishers and agencies.</p>
<p>"It's all about being a smart first person to reach out to, and hopefully that gives us opportunities to help games really early to make sure their pitches are the best and make sure they get the best funding and release."</p>
<p>Greenaway adds that what separates Alibi from other companies is its small team, and how it can be laser-focused on giving constructive feedback.</p>
<p>"I know it's cheesy in a way, but one of the reasons we set Alibi up is that we often have those conversations of 'Why hasn't anyone made this game?'," he says. "And then you think about it, it probably has but no one's seen it and they haven't been given the guidance.  That's what separates us from other agencies, as well as our ability to fully fund the title as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's about maximising and being really efficient with the limited focus that we have"</p><cite>Jarvis Crofts</cite></blockquote>
<p>"So it's really the developer's choice of how they work with us, rather than Alibi being an agency that will take your game to several publishers and just get you a deal. We can sign your title, we can help you achieve this part better and guide you through the process. For developers the legal side and the contracts are quite daunting – they don't want to focus on that. They want someone to assist them so they can make their game."</p>
<p>As for the sort of developers Alibi intends to focus on, the co-founders are passionate about championing indie developers and giving them the support they need to succeed in the industry.</p>
<p>"I feel like these developers are the vanguard of creativity in this industry," Greenaway notes. "The accessibility for indie developers now has never been greater. We really want to work with them and give them a better platform, provide them with the opportunity to succeed."</p>
<p>Crofts adds: "The great thing about these games is they're not asset-intensive or massively multiplayer. The best games in these segments are often from individuals or small teams, so it's mutually beneficial and that's a really sustainable model to be right now. Especially when you're looking for smaller titles because capital is really difficult without compromising a game like that."</p>
<p>That's not to say Alibi won't work with bigger, AAA titles in the future.</p>
<p>"While we may not be signing first-party titles ourselves, we can absolutely help them," Crofts adds. "Just to prove it, even a little bit, to get over that threshold and get signed by a publisher or an investor."</p>
<p>Greenaway describes this sustainable approach as "liberating" as it enables them to be selective about the titles they pick and not worry about how they're going to achieve revenue objectives.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We have a responsibility as publishers to be sustainable and to ensure that we're not letting people go or cancelling projects. These are people's dreams and their passion"</p><cite>Luke Greenaway</cite></blockquote>
<p>"We can sell the games when we can, which allows us to be liberal and work with the developers that we really want to work with," he explains.</p>
<p>However, he also feels that sustainability as a whole in the industry is a long way off.</p>
<p>"We're quite open with our model, because we just want the industry to improve," he says. "We can see our model being replicated by other people, but the irony is that while sustainability is so far off, developer opportunities and creativity are so accessible – it's never been better. There are so many brilliant games and so many people working in the industry and so much creativity.</p>
<p>"I think we have a responsibility as publishers to be sustainable and to ensure that we're not letting people go or cancelling projects. These are people's dreams and their passion."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-you-invest-in-lumpy%E2%80%99s-search-for-oil-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door.879192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-invest-in-lumpys-search-for-oil-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-you-invest-in-lumpys-search-for-oil-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Lumpy, the green Ratooey, is looking for someone to fund his search for oil in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. He’s certain he can strike it rich and promises a return on investment. However, he’s asking for a lot, so should you do it?</p> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">Lumpy appears early in the game. <strong>You’ll find him near the dock in the south part of Rogueport</strong>. He’s loitering near the extreme right side of the screen, and being a bright green rat, he’s a bit hard to miss.</p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">When you talk to him, he’ll speak of his aspirations to drill Dry Dry Desert for its black gold (oil). He’ll ask for a steep upfront payment of 100 coins. Pay him that, and he’ll ask for 100 more. Pay him that, and he’ll ask for 100 more. After you’ve paid 300 coins, he’ll say he has enough. He’ll then depart after Chapter 4. Despite his earnestness, there’s something sketchy about the whole deal. It’s probably the way he gets indignant if you refuse.</p>
 <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">However, if you do make an investment, <strong>he does stay true to his word</strong>. He’ll return to Rogueport after Chapter 6, and will give you a share of the earnings that your investment helped enable.</p> <figure data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-much-does-lumpy-give-you" data-injectable="false">How much does Lumpy give you?</h2> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">In <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, Lumpy will return from Dry Dry Desert after Chapter 6, and will bring you stories of his adventure, as well as a return on your investment.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Here are what you get depending on what you invested.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"> <li>100 coin investment – 300 coins</li> <li>200 coin investment – 600 coins</li> <li>300 coin investment – 999 coins</li> </ul> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Each level of investment is tripled, so no matter what you give to Lumpy, you get a decent stack of coins for your trouble. However, <strong>the 300 coin investment nets you the largest profit</strong> by a pretty hefty margin.</p>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">So, yes, <strong>you should definitely invest in Lumpy’s enterprise</strong>. This might sound obvious, but I’d recommend 300 coins if you can spare it since it will completely fill your pockets.</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="false">Speaking of which, the maximum number of coins you could carry in the GameCube version is 999. This means that if you had coins in your pocket when you collected from Lumpy, it would subtract from the number you’re given. However, this has been increased in the Switch version. I’m not sure what the maximum is, but I’m guessing 9999. Either way, <strong>you should now be able to fit all of his reward in your pockets</strong>.</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To really get into the meat of Chapter 3 in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, you’re going to need a Blimp ticket. You’re told that, in order to get a blimp ticket, you need to see Don Pianta. Actually, let’s start there.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">To talk to Don Pianta, you first need to meet his rival, Robbo. To get there, you need to slip through the crack next to the Trouble Center. There, you’ll have to pay 64 coins. Robbo will then tell you that, in order to see Don Pianta, you’ll need to buy a Dried Mushroom and a Dizzy Dial, then give the clerk the password “Yellow.” Well, first she’ll ask what color your mustache is. You can say yellow, but she’ll then just correct herself and ask what your favorite color is. Give her the answer “yellow,” and you’ll be let through the back door.</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">Up the stairs, you’ll meet with Don Pianta. He’s vaguely threatening, but eventually will give you the deal that if you can track down his daughter and former underling, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. They’re planning on eloping, and he needs to “talk” to them.</p> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Once the conversation is over, you’ll need to <strong>head to the Docks.</strong>&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">These are South of Rogueport’s main square. You’ll need to go right onto the docks further south, as the couple are standing at the end of it. Talk to them.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><strong>It doesn’t matter what you tell them</strong>. You can say that you won’t rat them out to Don Pianta, or, inversely, you can tell them that you are. It doesn’t matter. Once the discussion is over, return to Don Pianta. At that point, the couple will burst in and hijack the conversation. It’s a pretty mild scene. Cute even. This is a <em>Mario</em> game, after all.</p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">In any case, Don Pianta will excuse the couple through some more veiled threats. Afterward, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. You can disembark through the area north of West Rogueport.</p>

Each time, she talks about how hunky Mario is and gives him a little peck before running off.</p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">After Chapter 4, you can actually recruit her into your party. To do so, you need to head to the Trouble Center in Eastern Rogueport. If you’ve never used it, this is essentially a bulletin board for side-quests. While some of these only result in getting a pocketful of change for your troubles, others will reward you with extremely useful items or, as we’re talking about here, Ms. Mowz.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">In the list of quests, you’re looking for one called “Elusive Badge!” posted by someone anonymous (???). The request will tell you to meet on top of Zess T’s house, which you can get to by going into the inn, climbing the stairs to the second floor, and exiting through the door on the left.</p>
 <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">If you peek into the badge shop before talking to Ms. Mowz, you’ll discover her secret identity. She’s the assistant at the badge shop, if the shape of her tail didn’t give her away earlier.</p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Talk to Ms. Mowz on the rooftop and she’ll tell you the badge she’s looking for is in the room that Hooktail was defeated in. However, she can’t find it, which is where you come in.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-elusive-badge-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">How to find the Elusive Badge in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">To get the Elusive Badge in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, you need to return to the room you defeated Hooktail in. Getting back can be a pain. It isn’t difficult now that you’ve got more chapters under your belt, but it is a long trek. I don’t have any shortcuts for you; you just need to go back to Hooktail Castle and retrace the path back to the top.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">When you reach Hooktail’s Room, you’ll find it quiet and empty. Search around, and you probably won’t see anything out of place. However, if you go straight right from the door, you’ll eventually bump into something invisible roughly in the center of the room.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">Switch to Flurrie and use her ability on the invisible blockade. A sticker will give way and reveal a chest. Inside the chest is the Elusive Badge.</p>
 <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">As a note, you cannot immediately equip the Elusive Badge. It isn’t considered a Badge at this point. However, at the end of the quest, it will be handed back to you in the form of Attack FX B.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">With that in mind, return to Ms. Mowz. She’ll reveal that this was simply a test to see if you had what it takes to be a successful badge hunter. She will then join your team. You aren’t given a choice.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-are-ms-mowz-s-abilities-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">What are Ms. Mowz’s abilities in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="125" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">While not required to complete the game, Ms. Mowz is an extremely useful ally to have in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Her partner ability, in particular, is one you’ll probably keep returning to use. She can sniff out nearby items, hidden or otherwise. Her nose will begin to twitch when one is nearby, and you can hit the X button to have her take a deep whiff and tell you exactly how close it is.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">In battle, she has another useful ability. Her “Kiss Thief” skill costs 2 FP and will steel an item from an enemy. Since some enemies hold badges, this enables you to build up your badge collection further by swiping them. Plenty of enemies in the Pit of 100 Trials, for example, will have badges on them, and Ms. Mowz can snatch them for you.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Aside from that, her default attack is a physical slap. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-level-up-your-partners-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When upgraded</a>, her 3 FP “Tease” will make enemies Dizzy. When ultra-upgraded, her 10 FP “Smooch” ability can heal Mario, which is helpful when you don’t have the items or star power to heal any other way.</p> <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Overall, Ms. Mowz isn’t that terrific in combat, but she more than makes up for it with her thief-y abilities.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/after-selling-and-shutting-down-studios-embracer-group-wants-to-release-over-70-games-by-march-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=after-selling-and-shutting-down-studios-embracer-group-wants-to-release-over-70-games-by-march-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In its financial report on its 2024 fiscal year, the Embracer Group has shared its intentions to put out over 70 projects across its PC, console, mobile, and tabletop gaming divisions within the 2025 fiscal year. This comes after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-restructure-studio-closures-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring efforts that began last June</a>, which led to mass layoffs and some studios being sold off or shut down.</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The report was published on <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Embracer Group’s website</a> on May 23, which reveals that net sales were overall an improvement compared to the previous fiscal year, having increased by 12%. As for the 2025 fiscal year (which covers April 2024 to March 2025), Embracer says there is plenty of potential growth for its various gaming divisions, particularly for tabletop and mobile. Over 70 gaming related projects are expected to launch by the end of next March, which includes “three important unannounced titles.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Deep Silver</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Embracer obviously doesn’t comment further on what those three are, but it does name two key releases it has scheduled: <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Killing Floor 3</em>. Both games will launch for consoles and PC though only the former has a launch window of 2024, so the latter may not release till early 2025. Embracer also believes these two games will perform similarly to 2023’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-destructoid-deep-silver-zombie-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Island 2</a></em> (which <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2023-net-sales-increased-by-79-to-sek-9356-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold over 2 million copies in its first month</a>) and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-remnant-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remnant 2</a></em> (which <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2023-net-sales-increased-by-13-to-sek-10831-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold over 2 million copies in its first two months</a>).</p>
 <p data-characters="787" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">While there’s optimism for the future, with Embracer planning to dedicate a lot of resources towards the many, many IPs it owns (particularly <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>), CEO Lars Wingefors does acknowledge the layoffs. Around this time last year, the company employed 16,601 people, but that number has dropped to 12,069. That means 4,532 employees were let go in the past 12 months, which is a reduction of roughly 27%. “These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected,” says Wingefors. He also says the restructuring efforts are now over, and have “created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation.”</p>
 <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">The games industry has a whole has been suffering from severe layoffs, but Embracer in particular has closed several of its studios, such as Free Radical. That one especially hurt since Embracer had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-reunites-for-new-series-entry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped in reforming it to revive Free Radical’s <em>Timesplitters </em>series</a>, only to close it before we even got to see what the studio was cooking. Embracer also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/take-two-is-buying-gearbox-from-embracer-next-borderlands-is-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold off <em>Borderlands</em> developer Gearbox</a> (less than three years after it was bought out) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kotor-remake-developer-saber-interactive-to-leave-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saber Interactive</a>, with the latter still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-still-in-active-development-saber-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning to release a remake of <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="false">Embracer’s rapid growth and subsequent downsizing has made it a popular target of criticism, but soon the name Embracer Group won’t be a thing anymore. The company is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-is-ditching-its-name-and-splitting-itself-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">splitting itself into three separate entities</a>, and none of them will bear the Embracer moniker. Hopefully, there’ll be no further layoffs out of Embracer, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">Microsoft’s closure of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks</a> has proved studios can make successful games and still be shut down.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard is removing the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from Overwatch three months after it launched as "it hasn't resonated with players".
</p>
<p>
The mode will no longer be available to play from Season 11 on 18th June, after it launched in March this year. 
</p>
<p>
Players therefore have until then, during Season 10, to complete the Lifetime Challenges for the mode and compete on its Top 500 leaderboards.

"As we prepare for Season 11, we've taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played," reads a notice on the <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/update-regarding-hero-mastery-gauntlet/901366">Overwatch forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn't resonated with players in the ways that we hoped."
</p>
<p>
Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, with more expected in future seasons.
</p>
<p>
Overwatch PvE has been a bone of contention for Blizzard. The online free-to-play shooter's expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-long-promised-flagship-pve-mode-has-been-scrapped">Hero Mode was scrapped in 2023</a> as development "hasn't made the progress we would have hoped," it said at the time, though it promised other PvE modes were on the way.

</p>
<p>
Then in March this year, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-pve-content-scrapped-as-devs-are-denied-bonuses-for-the-first-time-report-claims">all PvE content had been scrapped</a> due to "poor" sales and Blizzard would "double down" on PvP gameplay.

</p>
<p>
Despite this, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet was added in March: a three player co-op mode that featured tower defence-style gameplay.
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">earlier blog post from Blizzard in February</a> insisted the developer had "heard [the] feedback" from players about competitive play and stated plans to introduce "big updates" for players to "see how you progress through the competitive ranks".

</p>
<p>
Still, the reputation of Overwatch has plummeted since its early glory days, with Blizzard seemingly testing new features and modes that don't seem to stick.

</p>
<p>A new Hero was added last month called Venture, revealed in the trailer above.</p>

            <p>
Players of EA games such as Apex Legends, FC 24 and The Sims 4 have been greeted with warnings that their "games have been removed from your library". 
</p>
<p>
EA acknowledged the issue as a bug yesterday, and said that it had now been resolved. "We fixed the issue with EA services on PC. Log out and log back in to access your games. Thanks for sticking with us!" EA Help <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp/status/1793255707808268465">wrote</a> on social media platform X.
</p>
<p>
But users of the EA app (the PC replacement for Origin) have said the problem still remains - and Eurogamer has verified this morning that the warning message is still showing for us.

<p>Eurogamer logged into the EA App today and found the notice that stated: 'Games have been removed from your library. View details for more information'. But when we clicked for more information, nothing was shown.</p>

<p>
Players impacted by the issue have reacted in anger, as access to games they've paid for has been interrupted. 
</p>
<p>
"It's outrageous that I spent a fortune on Sims 4 and can't play it," one player wrote. "I never thought you could make an app worse than Origin. But you did!"
</p>
<p>
Others complained that while access to their games had been restored, they still lacked the ability to load DLC. 
</p>
<p>
"By fixed you mean it's still broken right? No DLC is available in DA:I," one user wrote. "Still missing some BF1 stuff from account," wrote another.

            <p>Sometimes you gotta know when to fold, and trying to get new hotness <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuthering-waves">Wuthering Waves</a> to play nice with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> has got me creasing like an origami crane. While its Epic Games Store release can be worked around, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a> will get the game’s own launcher running, no combination of software, compatibility tools, or installation folder deep-diving seems capable of actually booting the game proper.</p>
<p>As such, I’m accepting defeat. Obviously with apologies to any studious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a> readers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t want to say Wuthering Waves will <em>never</em> work on the Deck, as pretty much all its issues with running on SteamOS can be dealt with – right up to that final hurdle of, y’know, launching the game. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-epic-games-launcher-on-steam-deck">Epic app is installable</a> either directly or via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">Lutris</a>, and I could at least get to the launcher stage by grabbing the standalone Windows installer straight from Wuthering Waves’ <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames-ads.com/download/?lang=en">website</a>. Said launcher wouldn’t fire up by itself – I had to dig out its executable, add it as a non-Steam game, and force it to launch with the latest version of Proton GE – but eventually it was onscreen and downloading the game files.</p>
<p>It's literally just that final stage where all the tools and tricks stop working, the launcher’s "Start" button merely looping back to itself after a few seconds of nothing. Reinstalling, switching Proton versions, and keeping the Epic launcher simultaneously running in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> all proved inadequate solutions. It’s tempting to have a big "Why! WHY!" tantrum about this – I might have one after this post goes live – but sadly these "just not that into you" situations can still happen with SteamOS, despite the long-running and ongoing efforts of Valve and other game developers to improve compatibility.</p>
<p>One alternative – if you’re not willing to wait for a potential fix, either to Proton or the game itself – is to run the Android version of Wuthering Waves on the Steam Deck using <a href="https://waydro.id/">Waydroid</a>. Youtuber 10 Minute Steam Deck Gamer has <a href="https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamOS-Waydroid-Installer">produced an installation guide</a> for this tool, which can essentially spoof a full Android system within the Linux-based SteamOS, though be warned it’s a pretty complex process, with plenty of command line action.</p>
<p>Patience might just pay off, though. Think of it this way: now that I’ve publicly admitted I don’t know how to get it working, the probability of someone else managing it within a few hours, humiliating me, must have shot up to something like 97 or 98 percent. You’re welcome.</p>

			<p>The Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake's code features something quite interesting, which may have revealed new details on the yet-to-be-revealed Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://x.com/RibShark/status/1793357532729418129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793357532729418129%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a> by RibShark, the game has a 4K performance profile that is obviously not used on the current system. While this could be a development leftover to, for example, capture screenshots at 4K resolution, other discoveries seem to suggest this performance profile could be used in another version of the game. Meatball132 not only <a href="https://x.com/meatball_132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1793397602190319873%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">confirmed</a> its presence but also added how the game's codename of GogoS suggests how there could be another version of the game, as the final S in the codename is usually used to distinguish the Switch version from another, which would be pointless if the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake will remain a current Switch-only title.</p>
<p>While a game like the Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake would likely have no trouble running at 4K resolution on the Nintendo Switch 2, it won't be common for the vast majority of Switch 2 titles to run at such high resolution. NVIDIA DLSS would definitely be capable of making it happen, but only at 30 FPS, and it would be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">"misuse"</a> of the upscaler that would limit developers considerably.</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is now available on Nintendo Switch. Learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/details-on-playstation%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98concord%E2%80%99-to-be-revealed-in-the-next-2-weeks-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.879147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been claimed that details on PlayStation’ exclusive’s next big game Concord will be revealed in the next two weeks.</p>



<p>That’s according to reputable dataminer billbil-kun via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-nouveau-a-propos-de-concord-la-prochaine-exclusivite-de-playstation-51320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dealabs</a>, who obtains the majority of his information via datamining. According to him, new details on Concord are set to be revealed by his estimations within the next 15 days (around two weeks).</p>



<p>The dataminer was unable to verify if the announcement would be made during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-showcase-next-month-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily rumored State of Play</a> or if it was real, but he’s claimed that the next announcement should reveal details on the game’s characters and a glimpse of gameplay.</p>



<p>Whatever the case may be, Billbil-Kun’s findings suggest that some new game assets have been uploaded somewhere, so an announcement is on the horizon.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun reiterates that he doesn’t know on the exact release date of the new trailer and/or when the game will officially be released.</p>



<p>Developed by the Firewalk team, Concord will be PlayStation’s next &nbsp;PvP multiplayer first-person shooter coming to PS5 and PC later this year.</p>



<p>On the game’s announcement, PlayStation said, “Concord is a bringing together of peoples. It’s the power of games to build connection and inspire social play. The Firewalk team is driven by the type of exciting, unexpected moments and shared experiences that multiplayer games create. Every time you log on is the beginning of a new adventure and every match is an opportunity for a new story. It’s these ideals that define Concord, its unique universe of vibrant worlds, and its rich cast of colorful characters.”</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to hearing more about Concord? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

It includes the takedown request, which also extends to Toasted’s Patreon, where the mods in question were made available to download to subscribers. IGN has confirmed Toasted has also pulled the Mortal Kombat 1 mods down from his Patreon.

In January 2024, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-turns-mortal-kombat-1-into-gruesome-adults-only-dreamworks-vs-pixar-blood-bath">IGN reported</a> on how Toasted had replaced the likes of Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Liu Kang with Woody from Toy Story, Mr. Incredible from The Incredibles, and even Carl Fredricksen from Up for various Mortal Kombat 1 mod videos. Other mod videos showed Rick &amp; Morty and Family Guy in gory Mortal Kombat 1 battles.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I voiced Morty, Rick, and Meeseeks in a ToastedShoes mod :) <a href="https://t.co/pftgehu7mS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pftgehu7mS</a></p>— Sean Kelly (@RealMortysays) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealMortysays/status/1739090770429366677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 25, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>Toasted said clips of his mods have more than one billion views across all platforms, and highlighted that NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon has shared clips of mods himself on social media.</p><p>“For over six months Warner Bros. have had zero issues with people modding the game and @noobde himself has shared countless mod videos and clips praising them,” Toasted said.</p><p>“The clips of my mods have over one billion views across all platforms that have allowed me to bring attention to the game as well as to continue supporting the team of developers I work with.

MultiVersus, a free-to-play take on Nintendo’s Smash Bros. series, sees characters from across Warner Bros. properties, including Rick &amp; Morty, battle in a distinctly more family friendly setting than NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Toasted has found himself in hot water over his mod videos. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-who-put-pokmon-into-palword-says-nintendo-has-come-for-me">Toasted claimed “Nintendo has come for me”</a> after a takedown of a tweet teasing a Palworld mod with a clip showing Pokémon’s Ash Ketchum in place of the player character, as well as famous Pokémon such as Pikachu replacing Palworld’s Pals.</p><p>The question now for Toasted is how to respond to the cease and desist beyond taking down the mods and videos. In a statement provided to IGN, Toasted insisted he will contest the decision. "We are currently listening to and abiding by Warners Bros request to remove the videos,” Toasted said. “However we are going to contest their decision. Right now we are waiting for actual communication from Warner Bros so we can resolve the matter.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

        <p>Dev struggled to find a publisher for free-to-play multiplayer shooter Alara Prime</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Fragbite Group is filing for bankruptcy for its internal development studio Fall Damage.</p>
<p>The Swedish development team had been working on Alara Prime, a free-to-play four-vs-four shooter that was aiming to release this year. However, the studio struggled to sign a publisher for the game.</p>
<p>Fall Damage was in discussions with multiple potential publishers, but had "not yet been able to fully complete [the process] within the necessary timeframe," according to Fragbite.</p>
<p>This has led to an "unsustainable financial situation"  for the developer;  while the dialogues are ongoing and the game's development is on track, Fragbite's board of directors do not believe Fall Damage will be able to pay its debts that are due and that this situation is not temporary.</p>
<p>Fragbite Group has emphasised that the publicly listed parent company and its other subsidiaries will "continue operations without interruption."</p>
<p>The news comes just seven months after <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fragbite-to-acquire-fall-damage">Fragbite Group acquired Fall Damage</a> in a deal with an upfront fee of SEK 20 million ($1.9 million)</p>
<p>Fall Damage was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dice-veterans-form-fall-damage-studs">founded in 2017 by DICE veterans</a> Gyllenberg, Mikael Kalms, Markus Nyström, and Dan Vanderlind. The studio's management team previously worked on games such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Star Wars Battlefront.</p>

<p data-characters="189" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After months of speculation and hype, we finally know that the 2024 edition of <em>Call of Duty</em> will be titled <em>Black Ops 6</em>, and we’ve just gotten our first look at the game’s logo. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">In an image leaked from a worker at a news press, Activision has allegedly been printing wraps for USA Today, which includes an image of the Presidents featured on Mount Rushmore with their eyes covered by blindfolds, with the words “The Truth Lies” painted on them. </p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">More importantly, the back page of the wrap shows the official <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which is the first time we’ve seen confirmation of the game’s title. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">The wrap also features a link to <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thetruthlies.com</a>, which was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-is-teasing-its-next-entry-with-a-strange-mount-rushmore-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first <em>BO6 </em>teaser</a> we got for the game on Wednesday, May 24.

 <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false"><em>Black Ops 6</em> is penciled in for an Autumn release, with many suspecting an October launch for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> blockbuster. </p>

            <p>
Sony has shared a video detailing the company's future plans for the next decade, including a look ahead at one possible concept for a futuristic PlayStation controller. 
</p>
<p>
"How far will imagination carry us?" the video asks, showing an artist's animated character coming to life before our eyes. 
</p>
<p>
But the controller is the video's most eye-grabbing detail, as we see it being used to pilot a character through space. The pad features a holographic screen hovering above the controller itself, and would easily look home on the Starship Enterprise. (Although many online have made unfavourable comparisons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2018-what-was-actually-real-in-the-e3-2005-ps3-reveal">infamous PS3 boomerang concept</a>.) You can check it out for yourself in the video below.

<p>
"10 years from now, we will be living in a more multi-layered world where physical and virtual realities overlap without boundaries," the video's official blurb reads. "If Sony, as a creative entertainment company, would be filling the world with new Kando [a Japanese term that roughly translates to 'emotion'] in that future, what kind of experiential value would we be offering to make that happen?" 
</p>
<p>
"To explore this question, we conducted a prototyping exercise under the concept of 'Creative Entertainment Vision'. Envisioning through the lens of Sony's creativity and technology, here we present the future as an extension of our lives today."
</p>
<p>
Sony does, however, state the video's content is "not directly related to any existing Sony products or services". Noted.

<p>
These latest figures mean that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Sony has now sold over 59m PS5 consoles since its debut on the market</a>. As Tom noted at the time, this is roughly equivalent to PS4 at the same point in its lifecycle.

            <p>
Embracer's headcount has plummeted by 4532 employees over the past financial year, while 44 studios have been closed and 80 in-development projects have been dropped during this period.
</p>
<p>
This news comes as part of Embracer's latest quarterly financial report, in which CEO Lars Wingefors states the company's restructuring programme is now "successfully finalised" and has "created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation".
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">restructuring programme began in June last year</a> following the Swedish umbrella company's acquisition of a number of studios, many of which have now been divested and staff laid off. A key reason for this was the collapse of a proposed $2bn partnership with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games</a>.

<p>

The drop of 4532 employees represents a 27 percent reduction in the company's workforce.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors described this past financial year as "a transformative year for Embracer". He continued: "Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation."
</p>
<p>
As previously reported, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer will now split into three distinct entities</a>: Asmodee Group, Coffee Stain and Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends. Each will, in Wingefors' words, "boast sufficient scale, coherent strategies and a clearer focus, paving the way to unlock value in our high-quality assets".

</p>
<p>
The last financial quarter saw a drop of 10 percent in sales, owing to both the loss of studios and the "softer-than-expected performance" of Alone in the Dark and Outcast: A New Beginning. The Tomb Raider remastered collection has "performed above management expectations", while Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection was "in line with management expectations" despite negative reviews.
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, the likes of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Killing Floor 3, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, Hyperlight Breaker, Gothic Remake and Titan Quest 2 are the most important releases for the next financial year, along with "at least three other important, unannounced releases". 
</p>
<p>
In total, the company expects to release "more than 70 game projects" during the financial year, though it's unclear exactly how this is calculated.
</p>
<p>
"We are now starting a new and exciting chapter for the businesses and people that make up Embracer Group. I am excited about the future and fully convinced that the best is still ahead of us," concluded Wingefors.
</p>
<p>
Embracer has been widely criticised for its acquisition strategy and the resulting layoffs, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-boss-defends-embracers-acquisition-strategy-after-bittersweet-split">Wingefors was defended by Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch</a> following its "bittersweet" split from Embracer.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs across the industry this year have now <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">exceeded 10,000</a>. Why is this happening?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/guides/24163081/wuthering-waves-codes-how-to-redeem-redemption<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xcDNtt">The ability to <strong>redeem codes in </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em> follows a trend set by other open-world gacha games from recent years.</p>
<p id="KMAOkE">Using redemption codes is an easy way to get free items, including healing items, Shell Credits, and premium currency Astrite.</p>
<p id="7rXo0P">As with other gacha games, it’s likely many of these codes will expire after a certain amount of time, so it’s best to redeem sooner than later to ensure you don’t miss out.</p>
<p id="iN8Vyq">What follows is a<strong> list of active </strong><em><strong>Wuthering Waves</strong></em><strong> codes</strong>, and the rewards you get for redeeming them.</p>
<hr id="NNwCUP">
<h2 id="FmI51E"><strong>Wuthering Waves codes for May 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="FWwhcK">The current active list of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> redemption codes are as follows, added in reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul><li id="Mrzzoc">
<strong>WUTHERINGGIFT</strong> (50 Astrite, 2x Premium Resonance Potion, 2x Medium Revival Inhaler, 2x Medium Energy Bag, 10,000 Shell Credits) — added May 23</li></ul>
<p id="8z1Ork">Note that for those playing on PC through the Epic Games Store, there is <em>technically </em>another code available via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wuthering-waves-echo-starter-pack-eae1db">Echo Starter Pack</a>, which is a one-time free add-on that, once downloaded, is redeemed through the same code redemption system. This grants 1x Incomplete Echo, 1x Premium Tuner 10, and 5x Advanced Seal Tube.</p>
<hr id="9EMTW0">

<p id="k4wUwX">To redeem codes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you have to <strong>open the Redemption Code screen in the settings menu.</strong></p>
<p id="pfYSQb">This requires some playtime to unlock — specifically, reaching Union Level 2, or around when you start the Utterance of Marvels II mission in Chapter 1, Act 1.</p>
<p id="1PSnUu">To find the Redemption Code menu, first open settings — on mobile, start by accessing the Terminal with the icon in the top right corner, then settings using the cog icon on the bottom right — then go to Other Settings towards the bottom of the list, then select ‘Redemption Code’.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty Black Ops 6 logo has been revealed by some newspaper advertisements ahead of its official reveal.</p>



<p>Although the leak does not reveal much, it does reveal that the game will be named ‘Black Ops 6’ and not ‘Black Ops VI’ or ‘Black Ops V’. Black Ops V was technically the name for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, but for whatever reason the name was changed during development.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-first-teaser-arrived/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 teasers</a> will reveal about the game, but presumably, we’ll be seeing more in the coming days. Yesterday, the first image of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-key-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s key art was leaked</a>. </p>



<p>It’s understood that this year’s Call of Duty title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6, will launch in late October</a>&nbsp;(presumably October 25).</p>



<p>The game will have an in-depth deepdive following the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, where more details on the game will be revealed.</p>



<p>What do you think of the choice to go for Black Ops 6 over anything else? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After making it through some early server issues, players have been jumping into <em>XDefiant</em>‘s high-octane gameplay, but players are struggling to level up their weapons, labeling the progression system as “criminally slow.”</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">If you’ve managed to get into the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-xdefiant-down-heres-how-to-check-the-xdefiant-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-playlist-not-found-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find a match</a>, and actually been able to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-xdefiants-controller-not-working-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use your controller</a> to play, you may have realized that earning XP is a slow process, especially when it comes to your weapons. This isn’t ideal, as weapon leveling is how you unlock attachments for your guns. </p> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cy4mov/weapon_progression_is_criminally_slow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on the <em>XDefiant</em> subreddit, Lo0ksToTheMo0n stated that even though they had played for five to seven hours, they had “barely” unlocked any gun attachments. “Unlocking the guns and factions themselves is fine but the attachments are absurd. It’s so demoralizing trying your best and seeing all your effort rewarded with what is, pretty much, quite literally a drop in the ocean of progress in this game.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Unlocking weapon attachments is proving difficult. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">For some, this decision is intentional, with Enigma_Green writing that they “reckon Ubisoft just wants you to buy Double XP tokens for things like this,” a thought echoed by nickypoopoo69 who stated: “I was at the point last night where I considered buying one of the Founders Packs so I could get a handful of XP tokens. That made me realize what kind of game this really is, and I’m not 100% sure I will continue to play it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Unsurprisingly, players want to see changes from Ubisoft, asking them to make the grind for attachments much shorter. With players currently only earning new attachments every two or three levels, <em>XDefiaint</em> players want to see that switched to every level, meaning you could unlock every addition to the gun by Level 25 rather than Level 50 which it currently sits at. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">I’ve found the attachment grind incredibly slow too, and can sympathise with the players above. I refuse to pay to give myself an XP boost, especially when fans who did buy them suggest they don’t make that much difference to the grind. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">With unlockable camos, there’s no need to make attachments the thing you need to spend hours grinding. In the end, it will just push people away—something that Ubisoft can’t afford if they want to be a true <em>Call of Duty</em> competitor. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've already reported in multiple instances about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming popularity of the Fallout TV show</a>. The fact that it proved financially beneficial to Bethesda was inevitable following the incredible <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surge in sales</a> of games like Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and even Fallout New Vegas.</p>
<p>VG Insights <a href="https://vginsights.com/insights/article/transmedia-opportunity-in-games-how-the-fallout-tv-series-made-bethesda-c-80-million-usd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now attempted to quantify</a> the earnings derived more or less directly from the TV show's renewed interest. They estimate that Fallout 4 sold 2 million copies, earning around $22 million, while Fallout 76 sold between one and one and a half million units, earning around $16 million. Then there's the estimated Fallout 76 in-game spend of $12 million.</p>
<p>VG Insights also expects that Bethesda earned a considerable amount (around $30 million) from just licensing the IP to Amazon for the TV show. The total estimate is, therefore, a respectable $80 million earnings boost following the launch of the TV series.</p>
<p>Notably, this total did not include Fallout Shelter revenue, which VG Insights reckons could be between 5 and 10 million. Moreover, neither Fallout 3 nor New Vegas were considered at all in this analysis. The latter in particular did solid numbers, making it on the UK's Top 10 monthly charts and appearing among the global best sellers on Steam for a while.</p>
<p>That means the grand total could actually be around $100 million. While it might not seem like an enormous amount, it's worth reminding that it is essentially a free bonus for Bethesda, which did nearly nothing in terms of effort. That's one of the reasons transmedia IP is labeled a big opportunity by many industry executives. For example, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-is-a-fantastic-example-of-transmedia-says-embracer-ceo-after-teasing-lord-of-the-rings-opportunity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently praised</a> the Fallout TV show for its performance in this regard.</p>
<p>Moreover, a similar windfall will likely take place for future launches, such as subsequent seasons of the Amazon Prime Video and the inevitable next installment in the game series (which Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is said to be fast-tracking</a>). All in all, it's a resounding win for Bethesda and one that will likely reverberate for years to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-full-year-sales-rise-to-39bn-but-15bn-debt-remains<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CEO Lars Wingefors says past fiscal year was "transformative" as group presses on towards three-way split</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Embracer has released its full-year financial results, showing a rise in overall sales despite a slow final quarter.</p>
<p>The company reported net sales of SEK 42.2 billion ($3.9 billion) for the full fiscal year, a rise of 12%  year-on-year. Sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 came in at SEK  8.9 billion ($830.9 million), down 5% compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>The group's debt stands at SEK 16.4 billion ($1.53 billion), compared to SEK 15.6 billion ($1.46 billion) at this time in 2023. Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> last month, CEO Lars Wingefors explained that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next#:~:text=debt%20that%20will%20move%20from%20Embracer%20to%20Asmodee">tabletop leader Asmodee is expected to clear most of this debt</a>.</p>
<p>Embracer Group has been through a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-ceo-says-restructuring-is-over-no-other-studios-for-sale">rough restructuring period</a> that saw multiple studios closed or sold, plus more than 1,400 staff laid off.</p>
<p>Alongside its financial results this morning, Embracer announced that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-cfo-and-deputy-ceo-johan-ekstrom-stepping-down">CFO and deputy CEO Johan Ekström is stepping down</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p><em>Full year (twelve months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales: </strong>SEK 42.2 billion ($3.9 billion, up 12%  year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>PC/console games:  </strong>SEK 14.4 billion ($1.3 billion, up 7%)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile games: </strong>SEK 5.9 billion ($550.9 million, up 2%)</li>
<li><strong>Tabletop games: </strong>SEK 14.8 billion ($1.4 million, up 13%)</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment &amp; Services: </strong>SEK 7.1 billion ($662.9 million, up 34%)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net debt: </strong>SEK 16.4 billion ($1.53 billion, compared to SEK 15.6 billion / $1.46 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Q4 (three months ended March 31, 2024)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net sales:</strong> SEK  8.9 billion ($830.9 million, down 5% year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>PC/console games: </strong>SEK 3.1 billion ($289.4 million, down 10%)</li>
<li><strong>Mobile games:  </strong>SEK1.4 billion ($130.7 million, up 4%)</li>
<li><strong>Tabletop games: </strong>SEK 3.1 billion ($289.4 million, up 1%)</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment and services: </strong>SEK 1.3 billion ($121.4 million, down 15%)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>For the final quarter of the year, the company cited Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor as key releases that performed well. Looking at the year's biggest sellers, Dead Island 2 sold three million copies and reached seven million players, in part thanks to its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass during the final quarter.</p>
<p>Embracer also reported that some mid-sized titles from THQ Nordic saw  "a more mixed performance". Alone in the Dark's sales "performed below management expectations", while South Park: Snow Daw "delivered within expectations."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the group expects "similar performance" for the new fiscal year, ending March 2025, with the "potential for earnings growth" across PC/console, tabletop and mobile.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Killing Floor 3 were highlighted as key releases, and are expected to perform "largely in line with" Dead Island 2 and Remnant 2, which launched in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Overall, Embracer Group expects to release more than 70 games by March 31, 2025, including at least three unannounced titles. Looking further ahead, the company expects to release a higher number large-sized PC/console games, both from established and new IPs.</p>
<p>The company noted there was a SEK 20.4 billion ($1.9 billion) impact on its earnings before interest and tax. SEK 1 billion ($93.3 million) of this was attributed to the restructuring program, while SEK 11.4 billion ($1.1 million) was related to the sales of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-sells-saber-interactive-for-247m">Saber Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460-million">Gearbox Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>The group's financial reports also gave an clear indication of how Embracer's headcount has changed during the restructuring.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2023, the group stood at 12,069 total employees, down from 16,601 at the end of the previous fiscal year. Of these, 7,699 are developers, down from 11,426.</p>
<p>There are 141 development projects in the works across all the company's businesses, down from 221.</p>
<p>In his comments, CEO Lars Wingefors said Embracer Group had shown strong improvement in both earnings and cash flows this year, and the strategy to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-splits-into-three-everything-you-need-to-know">split into three publicly-listed companies</a> is "tracking according to plan."</p>
<p>"It has been a transformative year for Embracer," he wrote. "The restructuring program, that is now successfully finalised, has created a stronger foundation for improved profitability, cash flows and long-term value creation."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation."</p>
<p>We spoke to Wingefors at length last month about the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next">future of the company</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-im-sure-i-deserve-a-lot-of-criticism">the criticism it has received around its restructuring</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/can-you-play-wuthering-waves-at-120-fps/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=can-you-play-wuthering-waves-at-120-fps<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> throws players into a fun adventure in an interesting world with a colorful cast of characters. The standout element of the game, however, is the combat, and that means that frames are importnat.</p> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">If you are wondering about the 120 FPS <em>Wuthering Waves</em> issue, then I have all the information that you need, but you may need to be a little patient because there are some issues the devs need to work out first.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-play-wuthering-waves-at-120-fps" data-injectable="false">Can you play Wuthering Waves at 120 FPS?</h2> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><strong>So, can you run <em>Wuthering Waves</em> at 120FPS? Not right now. That is the simple answer</strong>. The reason this is such an issue for people is that they were able to play the game at 120 FPS during the beta, but now that the full release has gone live, that option is gone. Folks are mad and want to know why.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">To put it simply, the 120 FPS option was causing some problems for players, resulting in glitches. As such, developer Kuro Games has opted to disable that option in the 1.0 version of the game and bring it back as soon as possible after they have all the bugs ironed out. “While the dev team is solving the problem, this feature will be unavailable during the period. We will inform you when this feature is available in future updates. Thanks for your patience and support,” say the devs.</p>
 <p data-characters="715" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">As soon as the option returns, all you need to do is go into your main menu, then the graphics options, and select 120 FPS from the appropriate selector menu. While there are ways to bypass this right now, should you want to, it is not something that I would recommend due to the impact that it might have on your game stability. While there are effective ways to juke that disabling of the 120 FPS option, this isn’t done by magic. You would still be forcing the game engine to run at an FPS that the developer feels is too unstable to provide a satisfactory experience to players. So, if you HAVE taken steps to do one of the workarounds and are wondering why your game might be crashing, now you know why. </p>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">It seems like the best idea for now is to just wait and play at 60 FPS, and then we can all enjoy a smooth 120 FPS experience when the developers have it fully polished and ready to go.</p>
