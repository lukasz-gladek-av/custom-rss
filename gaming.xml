It's been a busy day in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40K, thanks to its latest video game focused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a>. Not only have we learned a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">couple of classics getting a spruce-up</a>, there's brand-new stuff coming too, including a Boltgun sequel, new tactical RPG Dark Heresy, plus a smattering of fresh DLC.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Boltgun 2, which seems as good a place as any to start, is exactly what it sounds like - a follow-up to developer Auroch Digital's acclaimed 2023 retro shooter Boltgun. Details are relatively limited at present, but it'll pick up immediately after the events of the first game, and offer another helping of old-school-inspired FPS action over the course of its branching single-player campaign. There's talk of new locations - "from the colossal heights of a hive city to the impenetrable mangrove swamps of a jungle" - plus new weapons and never-before-seen foes, including the ferocious Bloodletters and their daemonic Juggernauts.

<p>
All that's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">PC</a> sometime in 2026. However! There's an extra - and more immediate - treat for Boltgun fans in the form of Boltgun: Words of Vengeance. This "first person typer" twist on the retro shooter - in which players must deploy their QWERTY skills for maximum carnage - is entirely free and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">available to download on Steam</a> today.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the gloomy world of Warhammer 40K, developer Owlcat has announced Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy, a "narrative-driven tactical RPG" set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. "Players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption," the studio explains, "from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary."

There's talk of full voice acting, "intricate investigations", turn-based combat, and "choices that carry grave consequences", all said to build on the ideas introduced in Owlcat's Rogue Trader. And if that sounds intriguing, Dark Heresy is coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dark_heresy">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-4cf5b0">Epic</a>) at some currently undisclosed future point.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Rogue Trader, Owlcat has <em>also</em> announced a 24th June release date for the game's second expansion, Lex Imperialis. This introduces a faction of "incorruptible enforcers" known as the Adeptus Arbites, plus a new companion - Solomorne Anthar - across its 15-hour storyline. Additionally, the studio has revealed it's working on a Season Pass 2 for Rogue Trader, bundling together an appearance customisation pack and two more 15-hour expansions - each featuring new quests and a new companion. The first of these expansions takes players to a Necron vault curated by Trazyn the Infinite, where they'll encounter ancient guardians and uncover relics relating to the Von Valancius legacy. The second new expansion promises a "descent into madness and mystery" as they explore a "surreal" voidship graveyard.

<p>
And while we're on the subject of DLC, there's one last bit of business to discuss in the form of Space Marine 2's new Siege mode. This "endless" PvE mode for the acclaimed shooter unfolds on Kadaku, where three players must survive against ever-more-deadly waves of Tyranid and Chaos as they attempt to defend an Imperial fortress. It'll be playable on Steam via developer Saber Interactive's Public Test Server starting 4th June, and it gets its full release across all platforms as part of a free update on 26th June.

<p>
All of which pretty much covers the big Warhammer 40K news, but it's probably also worth mentioning there are currently significant discounts across a huge number of Warhammer games on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as part of today's Warhammer Day celebrations.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-video-game-is-also-a-hockey-training-tool.1196889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been playing hockey for a little more than a year now. I’m not very good, but I am getting better. In between games, I’ve been using an in-development game and training tool called <a href="https://www.dangleverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dangleverse</em></a>, which helps me practice outside of the rink.</p><p>Hockey is an expensive sport. The equipment simply costs a lot, and you’re paying a rink every time you step on the ice.I get out there to practice pretty frequently. I play in either pickup or league games twice a week, practice with a coach, and drop into public skating sessions whenever I can.&nbsp; There are ways to practice at home, and I do that too, like shooting pucks at a net in my garage. Occasionally, I’ll aimlessly stickhandle a golf ball around my living room floor.</p><p>There’s, of course, equipment you can buy to optimize stickhandling practice off-ice, be it training panels that light up or obstacles to move the puck around. These often require the player to look down at the tools; for the complicated trainers that light up as an indicator of where to move up, it’s especially important to be looking directly down at the device. But in hockey, looking up is essential. You need to be able to see your teammates and opponents.&nbsp;</p><p>It requires two devices, but I’m using three — my phone to track the puck, my husband’s iPad to display the video game, and then casting the video game to TV. On the floor, I’ve set up the faux ice panel I typically shoot off of in my garage. That’s what my phone is pointed at, using a macgyvered stand, to track my stick and puck. The puck is essentially the controller, and your stick is your fingers pushing its joystick around. Looking up at the screen, I use my stick to push the puck around and make the on-screen character dodge walls and collect coins.</p><p>It’s quite simple, and I’ve only played it on the easy mode so far. But I can see the value both as a training tool and simply for fun. My husband and I are already trying to prove who’s got the best stickhandling and reaction skills, <em>and</em> I’m working on an essential mechanic while building strength in my wrists. (Stickhandling is really taxing on the arm holding the top of the stick; there’s a lot of quick wrist movements.)</p><p>Nickolay Lamm, <em>Dangleverse</em>’s creator, told me that the idea started as a Peloton for hockey; he and two others actually first built a small miniature hockey rink. But that was too far, something too inaccessible. They started thinking about software and a way to use tracking technology Lamm had been working on to make a stickhandling video game. Lamm said it took about five or six months to make a demo.</p><p>“The risk in this whole little adventure was, <em>What if what you see on this game is too laggy for the speed of a hockey puck?</em>” he said. “That was my risk, because no one had ever made a video game based off a sports object, especially something as fast moving as a hockey puck.”</p><p>It works pretty well, with minimal lag — at least, if you have a good internet connection. Lamm said with a good internet connection, there’s about five frames of lag, “which is actually pretty similar to what you get from a normal joystick.”</p><p>Lamm intends <em>Dangleverse</em> to be fun first, training second. “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/heybarber/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People like [hockey influencer] Pavel Barber</a>, for example, they’re extremely skilled hockey players,” Lamm said. “They can do things which no one else does, but if you look at their TikTok feeds, there’s no training. It’s all entertainment.” Lamm’s right; Barber’s Instagram page is filled with skits, like one where he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJz6zyzumGe/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks a training dummy dressed as ref in increasingly ridiculous ways</a>, another where he takes <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DISeR0JMPSy/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a slapshot using a comically long stick while standing on a Zamboni</a>, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG9HJAROfcA/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series where he attempts to Michigan</a> with things that aren’t hockey sticks. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDDr77EGSQE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Michigan is a lacrosse-style move</a> wherein the player scoops up a puck to toss it into the net, rather than shoot it. It’s very hard.)</p><p>“In much of the same way, this product is all entertainment and training is just a side effect,” Lamm said. “You know, kids play hockey all day. And the last thing they want to do is more training at home.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals"><h3>Clair Obscur’s Real Heroes Came Before Expedition 33</h3></a><p>The game's journals can be helpful, insightful, or just really funny</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/boomer-shooter-sequel-warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Auroch Digital has announced a sequel to their well-received Warhammer 40K boomer shooter. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving your Space Marine a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way.</p>
<p>Building on the combat of the first game, you’ll still be able to charge straight into battle with the chainsword in hand, and a wide arsenal of 40K weapons to blast them with. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

<p>The first game is currently available within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/may-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-features-balatro-boomer-shooting-dinos/">PS Plus Monthly Games for May 2025</a>.</p>

<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmfu_Spm-6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s some of the announcement blurb:</p>
<p><em>By the decree of the Holy Inquisition, you have been chosen for a perilous mission that will dictate the future of the Calixis Sector. Become an agent of the Holy Golden Throne and hunt down all those who would dare stray from the Emperor’s light. Hold fast to your duty, eradicate the enemies of the Imperium and battle the horrors of the void in the long-anticipated Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy!</em></p>
<p><em>Explore the Warhammer 40,000 universe like you’ve never seen it before! Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is an upcoming turn-based CRPG with a unique and thrilling narrative that follows the shadowy agents of the Inquisition. Take on the mantle of an Inquisitor, and use every tool at your disposal to root out corruption, sedition and heresy, bringing the Emperor’s wrath to those who would see the Imperium fall. Hunt down clues, investigate mysteries, and uncover vile conspiracies.</em></p>

<p>Playing as an Inquisitor will afford you extraordinary privileges within the 40K grim dark universe. In particular, Inquisitors have the freedom to align themselves with alien races, if this prove beneficial to your mission. Five companions have been revealed alongside the announcement including the medical specialist Epione Spes, Catachan fighter Haymaar Devos, and the Ogryn Conscript 0-118-B (AKA Cogg). However, there’s also a Kroot warrior, Ra’akhti, and and Eldar Cosair, Laarthyr Cainareth.</p>
<p>If Rogue Trader is anything to go by, this is going to be another vast CRPG from Owlcat, with Rogue Trader promising over 130 hours of game time. Of course, there’s even more game time if you account for the 15-ish hours each in Void Shadows and Lex Imperialis. This second expansion is set to release on 26th June, so the announcement of Dark Heresy is perfectly timed to make the studio’s shift between projects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SEGA and Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition, a remaster of the original Warhammer 40K: Space Marine that initially launched on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC in 2011.</p>
<p>Announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls livestream event</a>, this remaster will be arriving on PC and Xbox Series X/S in a matter of weeks on <strong>June 10, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>There's currently no news regarding a potential PS5 launch, though it could just be because this will be a timed console-exclusive for Xbox Series consoles. It'll also be available to play through Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>Developer SneakyBox was the studio SEGA chose to work on this remaster, and is a "<em>thoughtful restoration</em>" of the original game, according to SneakyBox producer Vaidas Mikelskas (per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>"<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition isn't just a technical upgrade - it's a thoughtful restoration. We aimed to preserve the spirit of the original while modernizing the experience for today's players. This is more than just Master Crafted Edition, it's a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YxYLWIJfP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new version lets players enjoy the first Space Marine game at 4K with remastered audio, an overhaul to the control scheme, improved character models, textures, and all of it is applied to the original game and every bit of downloadable content it received in the years after launch.</p>
<p>You can add the Space Marine Master Crafted Edition to your wishlist on Steam, Xbox, and the Epic Games Store, and it'll be available on June 10 for $39.99 USD. Last year, the long-awaited sequel, Space Marine 2, was one of the biggest games of the year. Though it might not have reinvented the wheel, it provided a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">very fun and bloody time, even if it was repetitive</a>.</p>
<p>Following up that success with a remaster of the first game is great news for fans of Space Marine 2, especially those new to the series, as they now have the chance to revisit the first game without having to play the original 14-year-old version.</p>
<p>Also announced during today's Warhammer Skulls event was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>, the next Warhammer CRPG from Owlcat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relax-on-beach-with-elizabeth-hargraves-newest-game-sanibel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elizabeth Hargrave is working on a new board game. The same creative mind behind the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wingspan</em></a> and the environmentally minded <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/undergrove-kickstarter-ends-campaign-over-6000-funded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Undergrove</em></a> is working on a mild game about exploring a beach called <em>Sanibel</em>.</p>

<h2>The Sanibel Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Sanibel</em> is a laid-back tile placement board game inspired by summer days on the beach, hunting for shells. Players can explore the shore, putting seashells into a bag and earning points on how they are arranged in the bag. You can also earn points by observing the waves crashing into the shoreline and exploring a nearby lighthouse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sanibel-board-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=f-kj6C_b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sanibel-board-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=-Ia299nz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At the end of the game, each player will have a collage of beautiful watercolor shells, sand dollars, and shark teeth. Whoever has the most points by the end of their trek on the beach is considered the winner.</p>

<p><em>Sanibel</em> is a cozy, meditative game. One that offers a combination of strategy and and atmosphere for both board gamers, ocean-lovers, and everyone else between. It is similar to journey-focused board game experiences like <em>Tokaido</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Tabletop Awards 2025</a> Strategy Game winner, <em>Let's Go to Japan</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Sanibel</em> is a modest continuation of Elizabeth Hargrave's catalog of board games showcasing her love of nature. <em>Wingspan</em> was a game about managing a bird sanctuary, a premise so evocative it got two spin-offs: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wyrmspan</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Finspan</em></a>. Hargrave's follow-up, <em>Undergrove</em>, was an insightful experience about mycorhizas, or symbiotic networks of seeds and fungi, in the American Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Another of Hargrave's games, <em>Tussie Mussie</em>, is a card game based on Victorian flower languages. It is an I-Split-You-Choose experience where you draw cards with flowers on them and combine them into appealing arrangements. Certain arrangements would earn points based on their composition, using real-world flowers like peonies and orchids.</p>

<p>The <em>Sanibel</em> board game is set to come out some time in early 2026 at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals : Ultron A New Age Begins Official Character Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Marvel Rivals' new map, Arakko, comes from the House of X-era in the X-Men comics when mutants transformed Mars into a new homeworld. Krakoa's other half, Arakko, settled on the red planet alongside a large population of mutants. However, Ultron has greatly changed Arakko in Marvel Rivals. According to the story update, Ultron has stolen the X-Men's Cerebro unit to become X-Tron, and transformed Arakko into "a cold, merciless mechanical world." To restore Arakko to its former glory, Marvel's heroes will have to unite once again.</p><p>NetEase Games is also making some adjustments to Marvel Rivals' team-up abilities by removing four abilities and adding six new ones. Additionally, Jeff the Land Shark is getting a Jeff-nado team-up ability. Marvel Rivals will also unveil proficiency avatars on the match hero select wheel, including mood and emojis personalization systems.</p><p>On June 6, Marvel Rivals will launch Ultron's Battle Matrix, a limited-time experimental mode. In the battle matrix, players will be able pick their own hero lineups and create unique builds that enhance their characters' abilities. Following those upgrades, players can battle it out against each other. NetEase notes that the dev team is using Ultron's Battle Matrix as a way to let players exercise more control over the characters and their abilities.</p><p>There are still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-marvel-rivals-codes-for-free-skins-and-rewards/1100-6530202/" data-ref-id="1100-6530202">Marvel Rivals codes</a> that can give players free items in Season 2. NetEase has also signaled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-battle-passes-may-not-disappear-for-good-but-theyll-come-at-a-higher-cost/1100-6531509/" data-ref-id="1100-6531509">price hikes for the Marvel Rivals Battle Passes</a> while citing tariffs as one of the reasons for the increase.</p>

		<p>The next big update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will arrive on 26th June, adding a new Siege game mode, new cosmetics and more. This will be another free update for the game across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Siege mode is a new endless PvE challenge. Set on Kadaku, the 3-player game mode pits you against increasingly challenging waves of Tyranid and Chaos enemies as they assault an Imperial fortress. While death and failure is inevitable, fighting for as long as possible is admirable in its own right.</p>
<p>Siege mode will be playable on the Public Test Server on PC from 4th June, with more details coming in the next Community Update.</p>
<p>Alongside the Siege Mode, Patch 9 will also bring two new customisation DLCs for Ultra Edition, Gold Edition, and Season Pass holders. This adds the White Scars Chapter Pack with a new Champion skin and three White Scars inspired weapon skins. Much more popular will be the Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack, with a selection of armour pieces that can be added to any Space Marine classes, as well as heraldry markings for the Blood Angels’ Successor Chapters.</p>

<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this month’s modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters.1196832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two classic Warhammer 40,000 games are getting fresh remastered releases this year. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition is coming later this year to PC, while Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition is launching on 10th June for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass.</p>
<p>Relic Entertainment’s Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War was a fantastic take on the RTS genre when it launched in 2004, with the game receiving four expansions in the years that followed. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition brings all of that together and gives it a technical spruce up to make it more compatible with modern systems and give it a little graphical spit and polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will feature 4K support, upscaled textures to 4x the originals, and adds in image-based lighting for increased fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have also been improved, and unit now have gloss and emissive lighting. There’s also an improved gameplay camera and the HUD has been optimised for widescreen.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the game has been upgraded with 64-bit support, making it much more compatible with modern operating systems and CPUs. This should allow the modding community to flourish and take the game to new heights.</p>

<p>. An improved gameplay camera will show the battlefield like never before and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. It has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods.</p>
<p>But it’s really Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 that is still in the forefront of gamer’s consciousness for this grim dark universe, and so the only thing surprising about a Space Marine remaster is that it’s taken Sega this long! Launching on 10th June, the original Space Marine has been enhanced by SneakyBox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition | Announce Trailer [EN PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12D1xaoEqGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a thoughtful restoration,” said Producer Vaidas Mikelskas from SneakyBox.</p>

<p>The game will now support 4K resolutions, has modernised controls and an overhauled UI, there’s also improved character models and remastered audio – Ork models now align with modern Ork factions and have 100 new voice lines added, for example. Also, the game has 64-bit support on Windows.</p>
<p>Best of all, this release still has online multiplayer support, keeping the original 8v8 online servers up and running.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising that there’s no PS5 release, though…</p>

            <p>
The Warhammer Skulls Showcase was full to the brim with, unsurprisingly, lots of Warhammer 40,000 game news, including a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">sequel to Boltgun</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">definitive edition of Dawn of War</a>. CRPG heads were also treated to a reveal of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a new party-based title from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/owlcatgames">Owlcat Games</a>, the devs behind another Warhammer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. The reveal came in the form of a nicely partially 2D-animated trailer alongside some brief looks at gameplay, all of which is looking quite good.
</p>

<p>
Much like Rogue Trader, Dark Heresy will feature turn-based combat, with this game "set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star." You'll have "intricate investigations" to complete outside of combat, with both those and combat potentially leading to some "grave consequences." Specifically, you'll be an acolyte of the Inquisition, and it'll be up to you to search out for heresy and ultimately decide what happens to the Calixis Sector.

<p>
As of now, a release date hasn't been set in stone, not even a release year, so you'll have to hold out for now. I imagine it'll be a while away too, as Owlcat Games are actually still working on Rogue Trader right now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> next expansion, Lex Imperialis, also received a release date reveal of June 24th during the presentation. A second season pass was announced too, revealing two more expansions due out between January and March, and July and September respectively next year.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">base game is half-off right now too</a>, if you fancy giving it a punt. Our very own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">reviewed it last year</a>, coming away from it with lots of nice things to say about, as well as a few not so nice things that probably would have been easier to deal with in smaller doses.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia has gone too far.</p><p>This week, the company reportedly attempted to delay, derail, and manipulate reviews of its $299 GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, which would normally be its bestselling GPU of the generation. Nvidia has repeatedly and publicly said the budget 60-series cards are its most popular, and this year it reportedly tried to ensure it by withholding access and pressuring reviewers to paint them in the best light possible. </p><p>Nvidia might have wanted to prevent a repeat of 2022, when it launched this card’s predecessor. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23777753/nvidia-rtx-4060-review-roundup">Those reviews were <em>harsh</em></a>. The 4060 was called a “slap in the face to gamers” and a “wet fart of a GPU.” I had guessed the 5060 was headed for the same fate after seeing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603421/youtubers-are">how reviewers handled the 5080</a>, which similarly showcased how little Nvidia’s hardware has improved year over year and relies on software to make up the gaps.</p><p>But Nvidia had other plans.</p><div><p>Here are the tactics that Nvidia reportedly just used to throw us off the 5060’s true scent, as individually described by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AiekGcwaIho?autoplay=1"><em>GamersNexus</em></a>, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews"><em>VideoCardz</em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/HardwareUnboxed/status/1920420643813691496"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em></a><em>,</em> <em><a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">GameStar.de</a></em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsy9FE4swtY"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a>, and more:</p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nvidia decided to launch its RTX 5060 on May 19th, when most reviewers would be at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, rather than at their test beds at home. </span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Even if reviewers already had a GPU in hand before then, Nvidia cut off most reviewers’ ability to test the RTX 5060 before May 19th by refusing to provide drivers until the card went on sale. (Gaming GPUs don’t really work without them.)</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>And yet Nvidia allowed <em>specific</em>, cherry-picked reviewers to have early drivers anyhow <em>if </em>they agreed to a borderline unethical deal: they could only test five specific games, at 1080p resolution, with fixed graphics settings, against two weaker GPUs (the 3060 and 2060 Super) where the new card would be sure to win.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>In some cases, Nvidia threatened to withhold future access unless reviewers published apples-to-oranges benchmark charts showing how the RTX 5060’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">“fake frames” MFG tech</a> can produce more frames than earlier GPUs without it.</span></li></ul></div><p>Some reviewers apparently took Nvidia up on that proposition, leading to day-one “previews” where the charts looked positively stacked in the 5060’s favor:</p><p>But the reality, according to reviews that have since hit the web, is that the RTX 5060 often fails to beat a four-year-old RTX 3060 Ti, frequently fails to beat a four-year-old 3070, and can sometimes get upstaged by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/17/24323888/intel-arc-b580-sold-out-availability">Intel’s cheaper $250 B580</a>. </p><p>And yet, the 5060’s lackluster improvements are overshadowed by a juicier story: inexplicably, Nvidia decided to threaten <em>GamersNexus’ </em>future access over its GPU coverage. Yes, the same <em>GamersNexus</em> that’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">developed</a> a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315781/gamers-nexus-video-reply-nzxt-defense-misleading-customers-flex-pc-rentals">staunch</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343867/gamersnexus-is-leading-a-new-class-action-lawsuit-against-paypal">reputation</a> for defending consumers from predatory behavior, and just last month published <a href="https://gamersnexus.net/gpus/great-nvidia-switcheroo-gpu-shrinkflation">a report on “GPU shrinkflation”</a> that accused Nvidia of misleading marketing. Bad move!</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho">22-minute video</a>, GN claims Nvidia threatened to cut off access to Nvidia’s cooling and latency experts unless GN agreed to do the thing you see in the charts above — compare cards with fake frames to cards without. GN claims it has the recorded phone conversations to prove it, which are likely legal because Nvidia was recording them too. </p><p>“Just to be clear, Nvidia, I am prepared to release them,” GN editor-in-chief Steve Burke threatened. </p><p>Recording every conversation isn’t how companies and reviewers normally operate. There’s been a serious breakdown in trust if we find ourselves here!</p><p>Nvidia is within its rights to withhold access, of course. Nvidia doesn’t have to send out graphics cards or grant interviews. It’ll only do it if it’s good for business.</p><p>But the unspoken covenant of product reviews is that the press, <em>as a whole</em>, gets a chance to warn the public if a movie, video game, or GPU is not worth their money. It works both ways: the media also gets the chance to warn that a product is so good you might want to line up in advance. That unspoken rule is what Nvidia is trampling here.</p><div><p>Nvidia is trampling an unspoken rule</p></div><p>On Wednesday, May 14th, I asked Nvidia in a group press briefing: “Are there not going to be reviews of the RTX 5060 before our readers are able to buy it?” </p><p>Nvidia didn’t deny it. “Units will be available from May 19th,” was Nvidia GeForce PR boss Ben Berraondo’s response, seemingly implying that a lack of early supplies of the GPU, not an underhanded campaign to influence early reviews, would be to blame for the gap.</p><p>Earlier in the same briefing, <em>Hardwareluxx</em>’s Andreas Schilling wrote a similar question and got a similar answer: “Could you share your thought on why Nvidia is going to release the driver for RTX 5060 with availability and not giving us the chance to do our reviews prior to this?” </p><p>Berraondo answered, “We are focused on delivering a great day-one experience for GeForce RTX 5060 gamers with our Game Ready Driver that will be available to everyone on May 19.”</p><p>But as <em>GamersNexus</em> and other publications soon revealed, not “everyone” had to wait until the 19th to start testing. Nvidia didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment about the <em>GamersNexus</em> allegations. </p><p>It wasn’t Nvidia’s only misleading statement about the card. During that same Wednesday briefing, rather than sharing Nvidia’s benchmark charts, GeForce product management director Justin Walker claimed the new GPU would “let you play your games maxed out at over 100 frames per second,” including demanding titles as <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> at 130fps<em>, Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 148fps<em>, </em>and <em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> at 130fps. </p><p>I laughed when I read the fine print and saw what Nvidia meant by “maxed out.” It meant a paltry 720p render resolution, DLSS-upscaled to 1080p, with up to three of every four frames imagined by AI — and even then, only when you paired Nvidia’s budget $299 GPU with a decidedly <em>not</em> budget $599 AMD CPU, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">one of the best money can buy</a>. </p><p>One of Nvidia’s other pieces of news from that same briefing was that DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation is available in over 125 games and apps. “DLSS 4 is the fastest adopted gaming technology in our history,” Walker proclaimed. </p><p><em>Does that mean GPU reviewers can no longer ding these graphics cards for marketing features only a handful of game developers bother to use</em>? I thought to myself.</p><p>But no: as of today, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia’s website</a> lists just 29 games with full native support for DLSS Multi Frame-Generation. The only way Nvidia can get to 125 is by counting games where players have to force it through Nvidia’s drivers, which doesn’t give any indication of adoption by game developers. </p><p>So now, I’m wondering: where else might Nvidia be trying to pull the wool over our eyes?</p><p>I can’t quite understand why Nvidia would risk fracturing trust the way it did this week. I mean, yes, Nvidia now has fuck-you money from AI, and gaming can feel like an afterthought. </p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620314/nvidias-networking">Nvidia’s networking business is now bigger than gaming</a>, which now represents less than 10 percent of Nvidia’s total revenue. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/620206/nvidia-q4-2025-earnings">makes more <em>pure profit</em> from AI in a single quarter</a> than total gaming sales in a year. It’s no wonder the GPUs are in short supply at MSRP when their makers are richly rewarded for putting silicon capacity toward AI chips instead.</p></div><p>But that feels like a good argument for Nvidia to <em>stop caring</em> whether its gaming GPUs sell, not why it might feel the need to meddle with reviews. If the desktop RTX 5060 doesn’t hit sales goals, the company will be more than OK. Nvidia would be less OK if everyone started questioning its integrity.</p><p>What might help explain this push, though, is Nvidia’s seeming need to make its founder’s new vision for gaming into a reality. At CES 2025, Nvidia CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price">Jensen Huang kicked off a huge debate about “fake frames” among PC gamers</a> when he suggested they were the future of graphics — effectively, that the idea your game should draw each and every scene 60, 120, or more times per second will seem antiquated. That AI not only can, but <em>should</em> fill in the gaps. </p><div><p>It’s not<em> so</em> far-fetched an idea: as my colleague Tom Warren noted in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338999/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-rtx4090-performance-price#:~:text=So%20much%20of%20modern%20gaming%20is%20already%20%E2%80%9Cfake%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20it%20has%20been%20for%20years">“so much of modern gaming is already ‘fake,’ and it has been for years</a>.” That might be why Nvidia has been so pushy about reviewers adding such comparisons to their reviews. (Nvidia has even bugged us to include MFG results in our AMD reviews, a request <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price#:~:text=Nvidia%20does%20pull%20ahead%20in%20raw%20numbers%20when%20you%20enable%203x%20and%204x%20frame%20gen%2C%20which%20AMD%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have.%20But%20as%20I%E2%80%99ve%20discussed%20at%20length%20elsewhere">we’ve largely ignored</a>.) </p></div><p>But in the end, Huang’s claim that the $549 RTX 5070 would deliver $1,599 RTX 4090 performance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">didn’t ring true</a>. The thing about Nvidia’s MFG is it needs enough real frames to begin with, or it doesn’t feel smooth, and if it already feels smooth, you may not need the extra frames. It’s not a silver bullet that can make a 1440p card feel like a 4K card and, according to Dave James with <em>PC Gamer</em>, it isn’t enough to make Nvidia’s new 1080p card feel like a 1440p one, either. </p><div><blockquote><p>You’re not going to be able to use MFG to be able to up the resolution on your low-end RTX 5060 to match your 1440p monitor, even with DLSS running. And you’re not going to be able to use MFG to enable you to run at the highest in-game settings, even sometimes at 1080p.</p><p>The extra latency and low input frame rates either make it a latency spiking nightmare or the AI generated frames end up creating a ton of unpleasant artifacts as you run around whatever gameworld you’re in.</p></blockquote></div><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e1a2-VxxvQ"><em>HardwareUnboxed</em> published a review</a> that shows the new 5060 may not be that much faster than the old 4060, even at 1080p. They found it 20 percent faster on average across 18 games, and as low as 8 percent faster in <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, 9 percent faster in<em> Stalker 2</em>, and 10 percent faster in <em>Black Ops 6</em>. At 1440p, the $250 Intel Arc B580 offered better 1 percent lows and is the superior deal if you can find it at that price.</p><p>We may never know how many PC gamers bought an RTX 5060 without seeing any such comparisons, because Nvidia kept proper reviews from arriving on time. But in many cases, it won’t be too late to return those GPUs. Maybe Nvidia’s bad behavior is enough to push us to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/670285/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-announcement-computex">buy AMD’s new card</a> or wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/intel/670037/computex-2025-intel-arc-pro-ai-b770-rumor">Intel’s next card</a> instead, challenging <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-aib-market-share-grow-90-percent-total-gpu-shipments-decline-q3-2024/">Nvidia’s 90-percent control of the market</a> and, perhaps, bringing some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">much-needed competition</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s 4K support, upscaled textures (4x the originals), and image-based lighting for a higher level of fidelity while retaining the classic experience. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting “will faithfully enhance the moment-to-moment action.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The camera now lets you pull back further to see more on-screen, and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. Dawn of War has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20 years of community mods upon release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Definitive Edition celebrates the original Dawn of War and preserves the legacy of this landmark Warhammer 40,000 title for years to come,” said Justin Dowdeswell, CEO at Relic Entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Warhammer 40,000 is more popular than ever, and we want new players to experience where the classic Dawn of War franchise began, while providing a platform for our long-time fans to relive it in its entirety.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition was announced during the Warhammer Skulls 2025 broadcast.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1196742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first developer name that comes to your mind when I say "Souls" series is very likely Hidetaka Miyazaki, the director of the Dark Souls series, Sekiro, Bloodborne, and of course, Elden Ring. But Nightreign marks the second time in the series the director baton is being passed to another: Junya Ishizaki. During my visit to FromSoftware's office in Japan, I got to sit down to talk with Ishizaki-san about what it's like sitting in the director's chair, dig into some of the more unique design decisions Nightreign brings to the table, and learn a little more about the origins of this Elden Ring spin-off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In a previous interview you had said that you brought the idea for Nightreign to Miyazaki-san who gave you the green light. Was the initial pitch for Nightreign close to what was ultimately made or did anything change between the conception and the execution of the idea?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Junya Ishizaki - Director of Elden Ring: Nightreign: </strong>The general concept we planned didn't change a great deal from what we initially pitched to Miyazaki, but during the course of development we've had a lot of input from other staff, ideas and concerns and all that sort of thing, which we've managed to take and incorporate into the game in exciting ways that kind of went beyond the initial concept.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In terms of advice from Miyazaki — well this wasn't just from Miyazaki but other directors at From — the one that stuck with me and etched into my mind was that a director shouldn't hold back.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So talking about some of that feedback, you guys had a Closed Network Test. Can you talk a little bit about how that helped you inform development for Nightreign and what lessons you learned from people playing the test?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, game balance was a large part of it. Balancing and tweaking the game difficulty is always a large challenge when it comes to these games, along with responding to user feedback and incorporating that into the game as well. So we're continuing to look at that, but it was generally interesting to see player behavior, and get some good feedback from how players played the game and interacted with the systems. And also there's a lot of new rules and a lot of new systems in this new game design of Nightreign. So it was important to see how players gave us feedback to that and how we could make the onboarding process and explain those new systems better for them when the game comes out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">C<strong>an you talk about what it's been like jumping into the director's seat for this project? And did you get any advice from Miyazaki in terms of how to approach directing a video game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As director, my feeling was essentially: I've just got to do this, I've got to put my all into it. It was me who brought the initial idea forward, so it's obviously something I wanted to do, but I realized that I would need the resolve to see it through to completion or see it through to the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of advice from Miyazaki — well this wasn't just from Miyazaki but other directors at From — the one that stuck with me and etched into my mind was that a director shouldn't hold back. So, on the day-to-day process of making games, something that maybe I would've given a pass to would not get through so easily as director. I'd have to be a bit more critical, put a bit more discipline on myself to really take a good look at these things and decide the best way forward for the whole project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going back to that previous interview, you had said before that you can only play Nightreign either as a solo player or in a group of three. If you play in a group of two, then it matchmakes the third person. Can you talk a little bit about why there's no option for just a pair of players to drop into a match together?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Talking a little bit about that solo experience, can you explain how the game scales down the difficulty? Are there any unique things that happen when you're playing as a solo player versus playing in a squad?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as this game is built around three players, we understand the concerns of those solo players, but essentially a lot of the time in Nightreign you will be acting and behaving on your own. Even in a group as three, you'll be going off and challenging different areas of the map and collecting different things before you accumulate together at the boss fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So solo play is generally encouraged and is a natural part of the game loop, but also in general for those solo players — and this might be something that's difficult to notice in multiplayer — but the activeness and aggressiveness of enemies towards any one single player has been adjusted so that you don't find yourself in any unreasonable multi-foe fights. And just generally, when you're playing single player, the parameters adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session. So we hope that this will alleviate that feeling somewhat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course there are no revives when you're solo, there are no teammates to revive you, so it is definitely a more challenging thing for the player to face. But we have also incorporated a self-revive feature which is possible to discover around the map just to allow them some more chances to continue that learning of the patterns and learning of the bosses without having to restart all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Switching gears a bit to the story of Nightreign, can you set the stage and talk about how this game fits into Elden Ring's lore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen the lands between in this alternate timeline and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention, it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition. It needs something to oppose it and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that I got to find out while I've been here is the way the story plays out over the course of a variety of remembrances. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to make the story of Nightreign come out through these individual character storylines versus a more traditional style of telling the story with a beginning, middle, and end?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So as mentioned just now of course we have this phenomenon called the Night Lord and this calamity has brought these Nightfaring warriors together for the purpose of fulfilling the prophecy of defeating the Night Lord. So these are different characters from different times and different cultures who have been brought together to face this calamity, but that's not their sole objective. They each have their own aims and their own motivations and their own anguishes that they are grappling with. We hope that players will enjoy exploring and unraveling each of these aspects, unraveling more of their character backstories and find some attachment to each character. This time of course, players aren't creating their own character, so we hopefully have incorporated a lot of elements that give them a lot of character and give them a lot of room to explore and find their favorites among them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obviously, this was designed as a co-op PVE kind of experience, but PVP has always been a big part of the FromSoft RPG lineage. Was PVP ever something that was considered like having your squad being able to invade another squad's world or anything like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be very… Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kind of drilling into the whole balance aspect, can you talk about how strict your approach to balancing has been and how the approach differs from something more single-player focused like base Elden Ring that also has those PVP elements?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more solo play oriented games such as Elden Ring, of course we're taking a lot of things into account such as the stages, how the enemies are laid out and designed, the wide breadth of player builds and equipment as well. So this time the approach is a little bit different and we are trying to cater to a fun experience with three people. So making sure the experience is fun at its core with a group of three, but it also doesn't collapse if it's a solo player as well. So combined with the new character actions that we brought in for each of the Nightfarers and for each of these new bosses, for example Gladius, I believe you faced yesterday or today's session, these are bosses as well that have been tuned and balanced for party play, for solo, for three play co-op. So this was an important aspect of the balancing approach for Nightreign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of those bosses, it seems like the difficulty of the bosses compared to something like Elden Ring has kind of jumped up — the bosses deal a lot more damage, they take a lot more hits, presumably being balanced because due to the nature of having three players in a squad. Did you have an idea in mind of what might be too difficult for base Elden Ring, but just right for Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So with the general rule set of Nightreign being this, or rather, the structure being this three day/night cycle, we wanted the boss fight at the end, this culmination of everything, to reflect the player, what they've learned and what they've established during that time. So this was an important aspect of the balance. You don't get a lot of room to breathe maybe that you do in Elden Ring where you have a lot of time to build up and go back to a boss. But instead you have this quite comparatively strict structure with the three days and nights to prepare.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[The bosses] are supposed to be very imposing, and challenging, and fearsome when you face them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so that was an important aspect of balancing these bosses. They are supposed to be very imposing, and challenging, and fearsome when you face them, but after some time and some learning and some observation, you'll be able to defeat them at the end of this three day and night cycle. So that was a large part of it was creating that balance between the structure and that culminates in a fun and exciting boss fight itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A big aspect of FromSoft’s prior games is the post-game: New Game Plus, and other post-game challenges that await you even after you complete the game. Does Nightreign have something like that waiting for players after they defeat the eight Nightlords?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have incorporated some post-game or end-game features for players once they've gone through all of the Nightlords. I first want to stress that to get to that point, we feel that there is enough content there to satisfy users in general, so to get through each of those Nightlords and use each of these characters and experiment with the game as a whole. But beyond that, you have the unlocking relics, new relic rites to experiment even more with the character builds. You have these elements that you will be accumulating as you proceed through the game, such as the relics and the character stories and scenarios, but there's no time limit on these at all. There's no limit to how much the player can explore and how long they take. So we hope that these elements will give them a little extra bump to go past the end game and explore a bit more of what the game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Did you ever consider making Nightreign a free-to-play game instead of it being a premium priced experience? And can you talk a little bit about the decision to put a price tag on it when so much of the competition in the multiplayer space is free-to-play these days?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play was one consideration, but given the time and the budget and the workforce that we had and the ideas that we were developing with our staff that we were cultivating, we felt that the best course of action for Nightreign was to release it as a non-full price but also not full play title. So we hope that there's enough content there that justifies this purchase and that players will get to experience everything it has to offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, is there anything that you're really happy about and are particularly proud of with regards to what you accomplished with Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a broad summary, but I'm just generally pleased that we managed to take this game from its initial concept to its implementation and develop it as in terms of the vision that I initially had from that three day and night structure to the way that players come together and sort of converge in this condensed RPG system and to fight against that boss together, this was a strong idea that I had and I knew that it would go well that if we could implement it properly and I know that games are, when they take shape, it's a bit of a miracle in itself, so I'm extremely thankful to the team and I'm extremely pleased that we managed to realize this concept to its completion. So yes, that's definitely something I'm very proud of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[Editor's Note: This article previously mentioned that this was the first time that the baton of director had been passed from Hidetaka Miyazaki to another. It has been corrected to mention that it's actually the second time, with Yui Tanimura and Tomohiro Shibuya co-directing Dark Souls 2. We apologize for the error.]</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

                <p>2017's Star Wars Battlefront II from Battlefield developer DICE is popular again, with player numbers jumping on Steam to near record-levels. This is happening amidst a fan campaign for EA to make another entry in the popular, multimillion-selling franchise.</p><p>The game reached 9,292 concurrent players on Steam in the past 24 hours, which is just shy of its all-time peak concurrent record of 10,489, according to data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The game was hovering between 1,500 and 3,000 peak concurrent players until mid-April 2025, when player numbers began surging for the eight-year-old game.</p><p>This was around the time that the Star Wars TV series Andor came back for its second and final season on Disney+.</p><p>Exactly why the game is experiencing a big uptick is unknown, but it comes amid a campaign for a third game in the new series. Recently, actor Muhannad Ben Amor from Andor posted on his Instagram story, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Star Wars gotta give us Battlefront 3 ASAP."</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront subreddit</a> is experiencing lots of activity and engagement lately, with fans discussing how much they're enjoying returning to the game. Battlefront II is included with EA Play, so that means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also get it as part of their membership.</p><p>2015's Battlefront and 2017's Battlefront II combined to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">more than 33 million copies</a>, but despite that, EA has not confirmed any plans for more entries in the series. It was reported in 2024 that EA rejected a pitch from DICE for Battlefront III due to the licensing costs it would have to pay Disney. The report said a potential Battlefront III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">would need to sell 20% more copies to justify its production budget.</a></p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005, and it was also developed by Pandemic. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">the second trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was finally released by Rockstar Games, and as Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick put it, it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-broke-the-internet-take-two-boss-says/1100-6531601/" data-ref-id="1100-6531601">broke the internet</a>." To date, it has over one billion views on YouTube, so it was inevitable that fans would remix the original trailer into a new form. Now, someone has released a remake of the GTA 6 trailer with a PlayStation 2-inspired makeover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axZp9CH8prU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The PS2 Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was posted on YouTube by a user called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foosmoke</a>, and there appears to be some subtle humor in this video. There's clipping when Jason robs the convenience store, which is definitely true to a PS2 experience. Jason also appears to have more trouble lifting weights in this version <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-jason-does-he-even-lift-bro-heres-how-much-he-can-bench/1100-6531346/" data-ref-id="1100-6531346">than he did in the actual trailer</a>.</p><p>The Vice City glimpsed in this trailer remake is also noticeably less populated than the one seen in the original trailer. The PS2-era GTA games couldn't handle subtle expressions and body language in their character models like the new game can. And without those touches, this take on the GTA 6 trailer doesn't have the same resonance as the original.</p><p>Digital Foundry recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-was-only-30fps-and-it-may-be-too-much-for-switch-2/1100-6531393/" data-ref-id="1100-6531393">an in-depth look at the second GTA 6 trailer</a> and concluded that it won't be able to run on Nintendo Switch 2 despite the new system's greatly improved hardware. This PS2-style incarnation of the game would probably work for both incarnations of the Switch, but who would want to play this downgraded version after seeing what GTA 6 really looks like?</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on May 26, 2026. That delay is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">estimated to cost the video game industry approximately $2.7 billion</a> in 2025, according to Ampere Analysis.</p>
