		<p>What would come next after you’ve successfully taken down the biggest drug cartel in the galaxy, saving humanity ? Well, fame for you and your talking alien guns, some degree of fortune, your sister ending up in more trouble with aliens, and plenty more stabby bounty hunting, if the opening to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> is anything to go by.</p>
<p><iframe title="High On Life 2 OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtTLjkB0vbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through the first few hours of the game, it’s clear that High on Life 2 is picking up where the first game left off in terms of style and tone. Kenny the gun doesn’t make a return, obviously, and I feel that helps to take some of the edge off the improvisational humour. If that didn’t quite gel with you from the first game, it’s toned down a touch for the second and rebalanced to make some of the excesses feel a bit more optional. That said, this is still a motormouth first person shooter where your sentient guns are constantly jabbering away, where there’s long, drawn-out skits, and a cavalcade of bizarre alien characters, places and worlds.</p>


<p>You do have a bunch of returning characters, though, including Sweezy, Gus and Knifey remaining a part of your gang at the start of the game. It means you have a bit of rapid fire, shotgun-like blasting and brutally stabby melee in your arsenal right from the off. You can also drop Sweezy’s time bubble and shoot Gus’ blade disc as special abilities, while Knifey means you can latch onto grapple points to move around the fights rapidly. It provides a good foundation for what comes next, with new guns and more movement abilities.</p>
<p>Turns out some aliens still want to make humans into drugs, and as that’s revealed to you, you end up with a bounty being put on your head, forcing you to ditch your bounty hunter armour and start from scratch as an outlaw. But you do get a new skateboard, which is pretty neat.</p>


<p>As well as being a less strenuous replacement to sprinting everywhere, the skateboard has very simple controls and adds another aspect to the already fluid traversal. There’s a lot of the world that you can now grind along, latching onto handrails, sky rails, poles, wall edges and more with Knifey and then just rumbling along them. Spot a ramp and it can be used to launch you into a double jump, while halfpipes are easy to escape by just tapping a button to jump out of them.</p>
<p>It needs to be low effort, because it also ties into the combat in High on Life 2, which still provides countless goons for you to battle through, now coming from different bounty hunter gangs catching up to you. These encounters will often lock you down for an arena-style battle, each now with rails to grind around and keep you on the move. You don’t have to skateboard if you don’t like, and there’s still a lot of momentum through a fight as you dodge, shoot, use abilities and get stabby with finishers, but grinding on a rail can help you close or grow the gap to enemies pretty rapidly.</p>

<p>You’ll find a familiar structure to the game here, now with multiple hub worlds that then lead off to the different levels as you track down the bad guys. There’s some pretty wild diversions along the way, though. Even with the first baddie you’re after, you need to find a way to first get onto his cruise ship, which means befriending a lovelorn Gatlian through a long and messy drinking montage. Once you’re on the ship? Well, then there’s a murder mystery evening for you to try and solve, interrogating the other people taking part in the game, finding clues and piecing together the story.</p>
<p>If there’s one early criticism I have of this design, it’s that I wish I just had a compass with a marker on it to give me a direction. There’s a constant battle in game design between maps, objective markers and stripping everything away, and High on Life 2 will create a sparkly path for you to follow with a tap of a button… but that line disappears a few seconds later, and its pathing can be a bit obtuse to get you back to a main route. In this case a compass or a pointer on the threat radar feels like a better solution to give you a heading without spamming the sparkles.</p>

<p>We’ve still got the bulk of the game to go, but it already feels pretty clear where this game will land for people. If you enjoyed the first game and still adore Rick and Morty’s ad-libbed humour, then this is absolutely for you. This brings plenty more of that same tone, but there’s a sprinkling of new ideas and fun diversions that could make it appeal more broadly.</p>
<p><em>We’ll keep plugging away at the game over the next couple days to deliver our final scored review. Cheerio.</em></p>

Hold up now folks, don't get too excited, sit yourselves down.</p>
<p>As described in the official patch notes (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-2-4-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the new widget is a "compact size equivalent to four icons", so it's not going to take up a massive chunk of space on your home screen. Naturally, all you need to do is update the app via the Play Store/App Store, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added a new size to the calendar widget.<br>
- We’ve added a compact size equivalent to four icons to the daily rotating calendar widgets featuring various characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong>Tomodachi Life</strong> can now be selected as a game series you're interested in. To do this, navigate to your account settings screen on the bottom right, tap on 'Home', then 'Your Favourite Characters/Game Series'.</p>
<p>With the impending release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>, this might be a good way to keep up to date on minor announcements or videos. Of course, we'll be covering any larger announcements right here on Nintendo Life too.</p>

            <p>Wildlight, the studio behind recently released shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>, have confirmed that they've "parted ways" with an unspecified number of staff. This confirmation follows a former Wildlight level designer affected by the cuts claiming in a LinkedIn post that "most of the team" at the studio have been laid off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-graner-a37262114/">the post</a> from senior level designer Alex Graner reads. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." A number of other former Wildlight staff, including social and community lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427506515303063552/">Alex Ackerman</a>, lead tech artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josh-sobel-86232439_today-i-was-laid-off-from-my-job-at-wildlight-activity-7427497173774225409-BbWe">Josh Sobel</a>, and lead producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427563501134430209/?originTrackingId=lW1r0Ee1d6ngvaLbXVUkWQ%3D%3D">Hunter Hudspeth</a> have since shared their own posts about being let go. The latter wrote that "things are winding down at Wildlight".</p>
<p>Wildlight subsequently issued the following statement addressing the layoffs to <a href="https://x.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450">social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game. We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</blockquote>
<p>No exact numbers of staff laid off have been provided. In a quick scan of LinkedIn this morning I've spotted 18 posts from developers acknowledging they've been let go.</p><p>

Highguard released on January 26th, a little over two weeks ago as I write this. The subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">rather inane discourse</a> about a lack of marketing following its reveal at December's Game Awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">our James' verdict</a> on the shooter was that it offers a perfectly decent time, if not one that knocks your socks off at this point.
</p><p>
"At its best, Highguard is also subtly effective at recreating the best bits of its myriad inspirations," he wrote. "For me, the highlights tend to be matches that have the feel of a great <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> game: involving and demanding of attention, where enduring the momentum of an apparently superior team opens up chances to turn the tables, be it through sheer grit or the perfectly-timed deployment of magic skills."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by these layoffs at Wildlight.</p>

<p>Here's the exact time that Season 7 will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As ever, there are some Pokédex restrictions on which 'mon you can take into battle with you in Season 7. Just like last time, only Pokémon numbered 001-232 in the Lumiose 'dex and 001-132 in the Hyperspace 'dex will be allowed to compete, all of which will be set to level 50 for the duration of the battle. Oh yes, and you can only stick one Restricted Legendary Pokémon on your bench, too — so no super teams, okay?</p>
<p>As we say, there are still a few days of Season 6 remaining before all this kicks off.

It's a phrase that has been kicked around by corporate execs like a tattered old football in recent years, usually when announcing layoffs or studio closures. But what, if anything, do those two words actually mean?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-lays-off-staff-within-weeks-of-first-game-s-launch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Wildlight Entertainment confirms layoffs two weeks after Highguard launch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"'Sustainable growth' is definitely a buzzword that gets used broadly and can mean many things depending on the company," DFC Intelligence founder and analyst David Cole tells Game Developer. "But in the game industry today it reflects a real structural shift in how large publishers operate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sustainable growth—the buzzword—is part of the industry's big problem, says F-Squared video game consultant Michael Futter. "Because public companies, especially in our industry, have drastically over-prioritized shareholders among other stakeholder groups, sustainability is rarely attainable. The economy is in shambles and these companies are still talking about sustaining growth instead of sustaining their business. These are two different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But&nbsp;investor and New York University professor Joost van Dreunen says that Ubisoft—following a series of struggles, both internal and external—has "few other options than" a dramatic overhaul. "To put this in perspective: on an average trading day, Take-Two's market value fluctuates more than what Ubisoft’s is worth in its entirety," adds van Dreunen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cole says that video game companies are typically separated into two functions: publishing and development. The publishing arm is squarely focused on the marketing, distribution, and monetization of Ubisoft's intellectual property; the development arm is concerned with "the complex and costly process of building the game itself," Cole says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mattel-acquires-control-of-mobile-studio-mattel163-from-netease" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mattel acquires control of mobile studio Mattel163 from NetEase</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has historically been "one of the most development-heavy publishers in the industry," Cole continues, "with a very large network of internal studios and thousands of staff tied to ongoing production." But production budgets are massive now, and timelines are ever-growing, which means that huge production teams are hard to sustain. "That scale can be a strength creatively, but it also creates significant fixed cost and operational complexity when the release pipeline slows or projects get delayed," Cole says. He expects the industry to move towards a production model that's more closely aligned with film and television production, in which teams are assembled on a project-to-project basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not what Ubisoft is doing, exactly, but the shift towards "creative houses" is a more modular way of developing video games. Everything is still internal, but groups are now more strictly project-and franchise-based. It means that third parties, like Tencent, can invest in certain franchises but leave other parts of the company untouched.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In that context, Ubisoft's restructuring reflects a broader industry reality," Cole says. "Publishers are under pressure to reduce fixed overhead, improve execution, and rely more on an ecosystem of dedicated third-party partners in order to operate more efficiently. The companies that succeed will be those that can balance creative control with a leaner, more modular development model."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-appoints-zynga-veteran-bernard-kim-to-its-board-of-directors" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity appoints Zynga veteran Bernard Kim to its board of directors</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale&quot;">"The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality of the separate creative houses, too, means that Ubisoft's franchises are easier to sell off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale," van Dreunen says. "By creating autonomous divisions with clear P&amp;Ls, they’re making it easier for acquirers to cherry-pick the valuable parts, like Rainbow Six or Assassin's Creed teams, without absorbing all 17,000 employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amanda Farough, F-Square co-founder and video game consultant, feels the same way.—Ubisoft needed money from Tencent, which explains why it chose to fragment its business.. "The move to split off some of the more valuable IP was a convoluted way to have their cake and eat it, too," she explains</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen expects "selective divestitures first," then "either full privatization by the Guillemot family or acquisition by a strategic buyer that can absorb the profitable divisions. The real question is whether this happens before or after another disappointment forces their hand. Either way, whether it's Tencent buying Rainbow Six or Sony grabbing Assassin's Creed, I’d expect Europe and North America's indie scene to benefit from an exodus of senior talent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft did not deny the possibility of selling off one of its newly structured creative houses,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/">per a recording of a Ubisoft Town Hall outlined by Insider Gaming</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Ubisoft chief financial officer Frederik Duguet said during that call that divesting a creative house isn't the "first route," but noted that if, "in some years," a house was not profitable, the executive team "will look at the root cause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we open the perspective, and the options, if we find a powerful and motivated partner, and we agree on long term vision, and it comes with an important cash injection, with the force to invest in the future of the brands, if this is good for the house or Ubisoft, it is something to consider," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's split into these different creative houses is a way to provide "focus and efficiencies," too. Van Dreunen provides an example—the music publishing industry, wherein it's common for publishers to have different labels for different genres. "This focus improves the quality of their output," he says. "It also mitigates risk across the organization. When one division fails, it doesn't drag down the others, limiting its impact."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And success rates of video games are a major concern. Players are spending huge amounts of time on video games that are years old. There are more video games than ever, but companies are seeing declined revenue. Investor and Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball tells Game Developer that "most large publishers have faced declining batting averages." Fewer games are hits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The term 'tentpole' comes from Hollywood whereby a movie studio might release, say, a dozen titles, some of which lose money, some of which make some profits but not enough to recoup other losses, but one or two of which can 'hold up' the entire tent," he says. "Overall, publishers have found that too many titles sit in those first two groups than they expected, and their losses are too great for the winners to hold up the tent. It’s for this reason that nearly all publishers thinned their development pipelines to focus on fewer at-bats."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Ubisoft, he says, this is evident with its recent game cancellations, like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Publishers such as Ubisoft are looking to reset and refocus their entire investment programs to what they consider to be a more sustainable forecast and set of assumptions," Ball says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expensive video games that take a lot of time to be made and cost a lot of money need to be hits—the high production costs demand more, and games aren't often reaching the heights required to meet those expectations.&nbsp;Ubisoft is hoping that its major restructure will lead to more of those hits, and it's drastically cutting costs until it does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the effort is a public bloodletting and an implied mea culpa to investors who have begun to consider selling their shares, further depressing the firm’s valuation, and part of it is a restructuring aimed at revitalizing internal processes and, possibly, breaking bad habits," Cole says. "Ubisoft's failing is not a function of a lack of resources or talent, suggesting that an organizational refresh might be exactly what it needs to get its groove back.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's employees, whose lives are heavily impacted by the executive failures, are not necessarily convinced. An </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/">Insider Gaming report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggests that a recent Town Hall meeting in which Guillemot and other executives answered employee-submitted questions did not go well—specifically, the return-to-office mandate that some employees see as a way to shed employees. Guillemot said the "only objective is to get Ubisoft back on the right path as soon as possible, to share success and profits," per Insider Gaming's recording of the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two Ubisoft Paris developers told Game Developer earlier in February that workers are incensed by the restructuring and subsequent impact on games, studios, and employees. Those employees&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot">called for the resignation of Guillemot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

"Without us, Ubisoft would never have conquered and transformed video games as it has done.

            <p>Blizzard bringing a new playable character to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected - the first new character the game has had in 25 years - could be the start of an era of active development for the classic game, potentially seeing it evolve like a modern game does.</p>
<p>To recap quickly: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard shadow-dropped the warlock for Diablo 2 last night</a> as part of a paid expansion release and a wider 30th anniversary celebration for the Diablo franchise. Not only was this unexpected but it's a 'testing the waters' moment; should the warlock go down well, Blizzard will take it as a green light to explore more of this kind of thing going forward.</p>
<p>"We are excited for the opportunity we have right now to see what the community says about what we're making," said Timothy Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team, during a Diablo 2 interview at Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, which I was a part of. "And if we're trusted with that legacy and if it's a positive reception and they say: no you guys actually did do this very intricate dance preserving the 1999 game, then maybe we can think about how we pursue those opportunities in the future. But we have to nail that otherwise we kill the game in trying to progress it forward."</p>

<p>"We still have millions of people who play Diablo 2 - millions of them," lead producer Matthew Cederquist added, with a heavy emphasis on the "millions". "We saw the 30th anniversary of the franchise itself as a really great opportunity to surprise and delight. I don't think anyone expects a new class and all these features in Diablo 2, and I think that's going to be a moment that's like, 'I'm sorry, what did you say? You did what?' People won't believe it until we put it in their faces. And I sure hope it's as epic to the players as we find it. But is it a declaration of something new [going forwards]? We're going to have to see what the players say."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa. We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo"</em></blockquote>
<p>Understandably, bringing a new class to a treasured game like Diablo 2 was a nervy moment for the team. To my eyes, which aren't particularly accustomed to Diablo 2, the warlock feels at home in the game (I had a chance to play it for half-an-hour or so). Blizzard said a lot of effort went into making the class feel like it was designed in the year 1999, which I think it does. The team at Blizzard, more than anyone, perhaps, is aware of what's at stake if it messes around with the recipe too much.</p>
<p>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa," Cederquist said. "We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo. But at the same time, does it feel weird [adding a new class]? No. Do we have to honour that legacy of what was created? Yes."</p>

<p>Incidentally, the versions of the warlock differ in the Diablo games it's coming to - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Diablo 2, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>. Broadly, there's a lore-based thread running through them, with all three telling a connected story of the warlock appearing in the world of Sanctuary. This starts in D2 and runs through Diablo 4 and then Immortal. Diablo 2's warlock take also pulls on the game's more hardcore appeal, especially in the demon taming skill tree, which is unique to D2, whereby you can tame demons and have them fight with you as pets or consume them for bursts of power. It's fiddly but incredibly satisfying to do.</p><p>Should the community like the warlock, then, and want more, it will lead to a broader exploration of what Blizzard can do with Diablo 2. This might involve meaningful reworks of classes already in the game, for example, although were this to be the case, Blizzard wouldn't spring it on you like it did the warlock. "Let's say if we wanted to change Barbarian for some reason: I wouldn't want to surprise people with that," Cederquist said. "That is working with the community hand in hand, to listen to their feedback about the changes that we would make if we wanted to."</p>
<p>There's a bigger concern with this, though, and it's what happens to the preserved and restored Diablo 2 experience that millions of people clearly still enjoy? It's not a classic experience any more if it's changed. To this end, we've reached a divergence point. There are now, effectively, two versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected. There's a progressive version represented by Reign of the Warlock, which is the paid expansion the warlock is a part of, and there's the classic version known as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>
<p>"It's the reason why we separated out Reign of the Warlock and whatever future stuff we have, so that we do have the opportunity to change with feedback, but also preserve what people love in Resurrected, and all that data set is totally split," Cederquist explained. "Resurrected is going to time-stamp. If you don't want to play a warlock for whatever reason and you hate loot filters, you can still have Resurrected and it's going to stay there. If we make any future changes to any classes or whatever, it's going to happen in that Reign of Warlock space."</p>
<p>It's a big week for Diablo 2, not only with the addition of a new class, but also because it was released on Steam yesterday and on Game Pass (the Reign of the Warlock expansion is not included on Game Pass). There are already "millions" of people playing the game, as Cederquist said, and these releases potentially widen the game to millions more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the new sales milestone of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> also just revealed the final launch date of the <strong>Gothic remake</strong>. The game will need a little more polishing time, the group said, and is now set to ship globally <strong>on June 5, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, a public demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released six years ago</a> as a test to gauge interest in the remake. The reception was positive, despite some criticism of certain aspects of the demo, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>led the Embracer Group to found Alkimia Interactive</strong></a>, which has been working on the Gothic remake ever since.</p>



<p>More than a simple HD "Remaster Plus", <strong>this should be considered a complete reimagining</strong>. The studio recently shared several stories from the development trenches in a "Making Of" series. For example, they faced a fundamental challenge from the start: determining which elements should remain unchanged and which needed expansion or modernization. The original Gothic's strengths, such as immersive open-world design, memorable characters, and systemic interactions, had to coexist with solutions to plot holes, inconsistencies, and unfinished content. To help with that, <strong>Alkimia hired Mattias Filler, a writer from the original Gothic games</strong>, to provide an authentic perspective and tackle those longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Here's an overview of how the folks at Alkimia overhauled the original Gothic in each of the game's main areas:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="art-new-content">Art Direction and New Content</h2>



<p>Early in development, the team <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alkimia-interactive-delves-into-its-approach-to-art-in-the-gothic-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against creating an HD version of the original's art style</a></strong>, instead pursuing believable, realistic visuals, albeit with a dark fantasy edge. The art direction also<strong> draws heavily from Baroque painting across multiple eras</strong>. References cited by Alkimia include <strong>Caravaggio's chiaroscuro</strong>, Spanish tenebrism of Velázquez, the landscape work of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, Flemish Baroque color contrasts from David Teniers the Younger, and Hubert Robert's atmospheric ruins. The team also incorporated influences from the nocturnal scenes of Romantic painter Petrus van Schendel.</p>



<p>The Gothic remake <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes approximately 20-25% new side quest content</a></strong> while expanding original quests with additional options and solutions. Previously empty or underutilized locations received new content, dungeons have been made more interesting, and hidden paths to Gomez's castle offer alternative entry points. <strong>Cut content from the original game is being restored and reimagined where appropriate</strong>.</p>



<p>The writing <strong>maintains Gothic's signature rough, conversational tone</strong>. It's dialogue written the way people actually talk in pub discussions or pen-and-paper RPG sessions, rather than formal medieval speech. The English localization received particular attention because previous versions failed to capture the iconic tone of the German, Polish, and Russian translations.</p>



<p><strong>The narrative has also grown significantly</strong>, with the team working to fix the aforementioned plot holes, improve pacing in later chapters, and give more depth to storylines that felt rushed in the original. <strong>One major expansion involves Orc culture and player interaction with it</strong>. Where the original treated Orcs primarily as enemies to kill after brief story interactions with Ur-Shak and Tarrok, the remake explores their role more deeply, recognizing that the Orc War is the entire reason the prison colony and magical barrier exist in the first place.</p>



<p>The team even <strong>developed a complete Orcish language for the game</strong>, designed to sound harsh and aggressive with trilled "Rs," "ch," and "tz" sounds. The language's grammar was inspired by East Asian languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, keeping words short (one to three syllables) and avoiding articles, grammatical gender, tense markers, and plurals.</p>



<h2 id="simulation-systems">Simulation Systems</h2>



<p><strong>Major story moments now trigger visible changes in the world</strong>, including altered environments and updated NPC routines that reflect the narrative shifts. This addresses one of the original game's problems, where monumental events had very little impact on daily life. Alkimia also said that the Gothic remake <strong>addresses the original's diminishing player freedom in later chapters</strong>. The developers have strived to ensure that multiple paths and choices remain available throughout the game, rather than funneling into a linear conclusion, which would be quite contrary to the game's overall design goals.</p>



<p>The game <strong>employs a full-world daily routine simulation that runs constantly</strong>, even when the player isn't nearby. When approaching NPCs (non-playable characters), <strong>they spawn exactly where they would be based on their schedules</strong>, so players can now encounter templars traveling between the Sect Camp and Old Mine, something impossible in the original.</p>



<p>NPCs also <strong>react systemically to player actions, witnessing crimes, responding to trespassing, and interacting with thrown objects</strong>. New dynamic events include Baal Parvez preaching in the Old Camp to recruit for the Swamp Camp, with nearby diggers stopping their tasks to listen. Characters carry objects, react to weather, and discuss recent events and rumors among themselves.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay-evolution">Gameplay Evolution</h2>



<p>The armor system in the Gothic remake moves away from fixed guild armor sets to a customizable upgrade path. <strong>Players can improve camp-specific armor with different visual elements and defensive properties</strong>, for example adding wolf fur for arrow defense or mobility enhancements while maintaining the aesthetic of their chosen faction.</p>



<p>New abilities expand exploration possibilities beyond the original. <strong>Climbing functions similarly to The Legend of Zelda</strong>, but is limited to specific areas. <strong>Diving is now a proper skill that improves with practice</strong>, allowing players to interact with underwater objects, pick up loot, and explore extensive submerged areas.</p>



<p>The developers emphasized the game's difficulty, <strong>encouraging players to consume items through challenging encounters rather than hoarding resources</strong>. Combat remains unforgiving like in the original, and players can still attempt "silly things" like fighting powerful enemies from the start, staying true to Gothic's philosophy of not holding the player's hand.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration emphasizes the feeling of being lost</strong>, especially at night when darkness becomes oppressive even with torches and light spells. The conversation camera system uses preset shots with environmental checks to avoid clipping through walls or characters, with fully planned cinematography for important scenes.</p>



<p><strong>The Gothic remake implements a dynamic trading system in which merchants passively trade items among themselves</strong>, converting goods into ore to maintain market liquidity. This prevents the player from becoming the central bank and controls material abundance. The studio's economic designer analyzed the original game's patterns to understand its intended progression, identifying where the economy broke down in later chapters. The goal was to delay economic collapse until chapter six through active management, though complete stability is impossible in a closed economy with the player as the only active agent. <strong>Crafting recipes will evolve with player investment</strong>, and the act of crafting itself provides value by converting excess materials into ore while reducing inventory clutter.</p>



<p>The dynamic weather system includes <strong>varying sun intensity and color, cloud cover, rain with fluctuating intensity, storm probabilities, growing waves during storms, lightning illuminating the night sky, and lingering post-storm fog</strong>. The music system uses layers and cues that change based on in-game events rather than a single master track, ensuring players don't tire of the soundtrack during extended play sessions. The composer approached each scene as painting pictures, assigning instruments to visual elements and experimenting with melodies and harmonies to convey specific emotions.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the whole Making Of series is the claim that they've consciously created an art style and systems <strong>"not just for one game, but for an entire new series within the Gothic franchise"</strong>. It definitely sounds like they'd like it to serve as a foundation for future entries beyond this remake, although of course, the necessary requirement will be the successful release of the first one. </p>



<p>It won't be long until we can find out for ourselves. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Jason Momoa will star in the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, Momoa - who is no stranger to video game adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">with Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jason-momoa-and-wrestler-roman-reigns-tapped-for-street-fighter-roles">Street Fighter already to his name</a> (there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">even some Just Cause talk several years ago</a>) - will join Fast and Furious director Justin Lin on the film, which is based on Arrowhead's delightfully chaotic space-based shooter.</p>
<p>While further specifics on who Momoa will play in Helldivers remain unknown, it was confirmed the film will release next year, on 10th November.</p>
<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p>
<p>Lin's involvement was then confirmed in December. Some were disappointed to learn that Lin is not a gamer himself, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">the director actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film</a>. Arrowhead went on to show its support of Lin, stating it trusts the Helldivers film director, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">shutting down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation</a>.</p>
<figure>

<p>As for Momoa, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026s-street-fighter-movie-gets-first-look-trailer-and-it-includes-a-great-reference-to-the-series-most-famous-bonus-stage">he is playing Blanka in Street Fighter</a>, which is set to release on 16th October.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/</link>
            <guid>1433275</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, during the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>'s <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q3-october-december-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-528-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q3 FY 2025/26 report</a> (October-December 2025), it was revealed that <strong>Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong> game has sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> <strong>in its first year on the market</strong>.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II originally debuted on <strong>February 4, 2025</strong>, so it's been roughly a year and eight days since its release. The historical first-person open world action roleplaying game enjoyed an excellent reception; on Wccftech, reviewer Chris Wray <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded it a rare perfect score</a></strong> and waxed plenty of praise upon the latest work of the Czech studio:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<p>The game also <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to beat Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> in the Best RPG category of the Wccftech Awards '25</strong>, with our staff and readers aligning on this view.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II <strong>was updated with free patches and three premium DLCs</strong>, the last of which, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a></strong>, did particularly well, helping the game perform <strong>"well ahead" of the Embracer Group's expectations</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the financial report, the <strong>Dead Island</strong> and <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> IPs also performed better than estimates in the quarter. Even so, net sales <strong>decreased by 26%</strong> year-over-year, and organic growth <strong>also decreased by 8%</strong>. This decline was primarily driven by negative foreign exchange effects and the divestment of Easybrain within the Mobile segment. </p>



<p>Still, Embracer Group CEO <strong>Phil Rogers</strong> stressed that the company is going in the right direction: focusing on its core IPs (Tomb Raider, Dead Island, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and, of course, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-needs-to-be-turned-into-one-of-gamings-biggest-franchises-says-embracer-coo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings</a></strong>) while targeting a reduction in both opex and capex and completing its consolidation goals (they recently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</a></strong>). Let's just hope this doesn't mean new layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve almost made it to the end of the week, but let us know in the comments how your NYT Connections streak is keeping up. Are you in double digits? Triple? Regardless of where you’re at, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need below to keep pushing that count up!</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 12)</h2>

<li>FROZEN</li>



<li>PRODUCE</li>

<li>DAIRY</li>

<li>FAST</li>



<li>FORM</li>



<li>DRAG</li>



<li>FIRM</li>



<li>MOLD</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Ways to build things</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Stuck in place</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Abbreviate MLB teams and players</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that could go before ‘queen’</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 12:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <p>Just weeks after release, an unspecified number of Wildlight's Highguard development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>The studio's live-service hero shooter will not be shut down, Wildlight has confirmed to Eurogamer, but instead be given to a "core group of developers" to keep the game going.</p>

<p>In the statement shared with Eurogamer this morning, Wildlight wrote: "Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game."</p>
<p>The Highguard studio added it is "proud of the team, talent, and the product" it had created. "We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community," Wildlight concluded.</p><p>While Wildlight did not say how many members were affected by today's layoffs, posts on the likes of LinkedIn suggest it was the majority of the team. "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">level designer Alex Graner wrote</a>. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard."</p>
<p>Tech artist Josh Sobel was also impacted by the Wildlight layoffs. "It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before," <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Sobel wrote</a>. "I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything."</p>
<p>In a follow up post, Sobel said they had "LOVED working at Wildlight", and it is now "hard to envision going up from here", likening today's news to the end of a romantic relationship. "You can't think about dating right after a breakup. It wasn't just a gig to me. 2.5yrs of working towards a promising, rose-tinted future, with the most passionate and efficient devs on the planet. We fucking MADE THAT SHIT! Fast."</p>

<p>"I don't think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment's notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be," Sobel continued.</p><p>"We accomplished a lot, and I couldn't be more proud. But it's hard to believe it's over. Hard to believe that this was the result of all our efforts. I wish the best of luck to everyone who remains at Wildlight.</p>
<p>"If the numbers climb, I'll be the first in line to apply again."</p>
<p>"I join my incredible Wildlight teammates in having been laid off," Highguard's social and community lead <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2021745874435813748">Alex Frostwolf also shared</a>. "Highguard is the story of us: a group of talented, like-minded folks on an adventure into the unknown. Much like our Wardens who get back up after losing a fight, we too will rise again for our next adventures."</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this year</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Since its slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

<figure data-uuid="5880f3ba02a93"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5880f3ba02a93/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>This March, Pokémon is expanding beyond its usual battle roots with a brand-new game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> that seems to include a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>If the information and trailers shared about the game haven't already sold you, maybe the previews will. Here's what our staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say about this upcoming Pokémon title, and below this, you can see what other sites said, based on their own hands on impressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise... It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fkrpowg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57586-hands-on-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-the-series-coziest-game-yet">GoNintendo</a>: "It’s hard to predict whether or not a Pokémon spinoff will turn into something beloved or have a real lasting impact, but I think Pokopia has what it takes to get there. It provides an opportunity for fans to interact with some of their favorite creatures in a very different, more relaxed way, without a battle in sight. Die-hard Pokémon fans and anyone who’s become enamored with cozy life sims over the last few years should keep Pokémon Pokopia"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/90-minutes-with-pokemon-pokopia-convinced-me-this-could-be-the-biggest-cozy-game-since-animal-crossing-and-im-already-eager-to-spend-hundreds-of-hours-in-it/">GamesRadar+</a>: "90 minutes. That's all it took to convince me that Pokemon Pokopia is going to take over my life. This cozy, Animal Crossing-flavored take on my favorite creature-collecting series is packing a real punch – moreish exploration, building, and collection mechanics combined with delightful personality and a generous dose of feel-good: even from a short preview session, this is a game I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "Put simply, this is <em>Pokémon</em> meets <em>Minecraft</em>, with a delightfully goofy premise and the potential for lots of town-building fun to be had either by yourself or with a group of friends via online play."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on-best-entry-years-731895-20260211">Gamingbible</a>: "I barely feel as if I’ve scratched the surface of discovering what <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> has to offer and yet, I’m entirely sold on its vision. This isn’t simply a formulaic cosy game with a Pokémon overlay. It’s a really wonderfully considered creation that’s as accessible to diehard fans as it is to complete and utter novices. I haven’t stopped thinking about <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> ever since I heard the dreaded words “time’s up”, so I certainly know what I’ll be picking up come 5 March."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/02/11/gotta-house-em-all">Game Informer</a>: "Pokémon spin-offs are very hit or miss for me, but after playing a bit of Pokopia, my gut says this one will be a hit. It balances the aesthetic and accessibility of Pokémon with open-ended, relaxed mechanics found in cozy simulation games, and it does so without feeling boring or overly simple. I'm looking forward to playing the final product when it launches in just a few weeks."</p>

			<p><strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted its final spotlight announcement in its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">flurry of spotlight showcases</a> over the past two weeks with the <strong><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243862/catch-up-on-the-diablo-30th-anniversary-spotlight?_gl=1*1cph9zv*_gcl_au*MzgxMDg5NjM0LjE3NzAyMzQyMjQ.*_ga*MTM2NDczNzMwMi4xNzY4MjM1Nzgw*_ga_VYKNV7C0S3*czE3NzA4NzAyMDgkbzUkZzEkdDE3NzA4NzEyNzYkajU2JGwwJGgw">Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight</a></strong>, a peek into everything coming to the <strong>Diablo</strong> franchise in the coming milestone year. Like previous spotlights for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">Overwatch,</a></strong> and <strong>Hearthstone</strong>, plenty was left off today's agenda to be revealed at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>. But we now know of one major element that's coming to <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, <strong>Diablo Immortal</strong>, and <strong>Diablo II: Resurrected</strong>: <strong>Warlocks.</strong></p>



<p>The Warlock class is being added to all three aforementioned titles, the most significant of which perhaps is its inclusion in Diablo II: Resurrected, since this is the first new playable class Diablo II has gotten in <strong>25 years</strong>. Each game is getting its own version of a Warlock class, though the only version that's currently playable right now, is the one in Diablo II: Resurrected. That update was shadow-dropped as part of today's spotlight, which you can check out in full below.</p>

<iframe title="Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnAsWN-6hvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It was a tight <strong>39 minutes</strong> of news and reveals for the long-running action RPG franchise, capped off with Diablo IV game director <strong>Brent Gibson</strong> teasing that players will <em>"freak</em>" when they reveal more of what's coming at BlizzCon 2026, though the video comically cuts before he spoils the surprise.</p>



<p>As for what is coming to the franchise, starting with Diablo II: Resurrected, which saw its Warlock go live today, this remaster of one of the most beloved action-RPG titles ever doesn't just get a new class for the first time in over two decades. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo II: Resurrected | Warlock Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vKwWWzC5iQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That change is why Blizzard will still keep the vanilla, sans-Warlock version of Diablo II: Resurrected available for those who want it. That means when you boot up Diablo II: Resurrected, you'll be given the option of jumping into the game that Blizzard released in 2021, or <strong>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock</strong>.</p>



<p>Reign of the Warlock is a new paid expansion for Diablo II: Resurrected, which will cost you <strong>$25</strong> if you want to check out the first new class to arrive in Diablo II for 25 years. At least several of the updates mentioned in the spotlight today aren't behind a paywall, with the main draw being the new class.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Diablo IV | Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HIeWxW2sJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players can also enjoy updated terror zones, the introduction of <strong>Colossal Ancients</strong>, new quality-of-life updates like new loot filters and updated stash tabs, the introduction of The Chronicle to keep better track of your loot, and new items and runewords.</p>



<p>Diablo Immortal players will have the wait the longest to get their hands on the Warlock class, as it's not scheduled to arrive until sometime in <strong>June 2026.</strong> For now, the studio did reveal a roadmap for the full year, with new quests, gear, bosses, new endgame PvE challenges, zone events, subzones, and more, all set to arrive before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Lastly, Diablo IV players also have some waiting to do to learn more about the Warlock they'll be getting to play as when the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/">Lord of Hatred</a></strong> expansion arrives on <strong>April 28, 2026.</strong> Blizzard will host another spotlight event on <strong>March 5, 2026,</strong> which will be digging into the Warlock class, showcasing its strength and abilities in action.</p>



<p>The new expansion will also include a reignited endgame experience with the introduction of <strong>War Plans</strong>, which lets you decide what kind of endgame you want. You'll be able to create a playlist of activities based on what you want to do, choosing from six endgame modes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Pit</li>



<li>Infernal Hordes</li>



<li>Heltides</li>



<li>Nightmare Dungeons</li>



<li>Lair Bosses</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on what rewards you hope to return with and what kind of experience you want, you'll curate your endgame between five of those options, earning progression points in a unique endgame skill tree. Diablo IV will also get a new "<em>hyper-rare</em>" endurance event, <strong>Echoing Hatred</strong>, which bombards you with enemy waves until you die, earning more and better loot the longer you can survive.</p>

            <guid>1433191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's happened again. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play live service first-person shooter to enter the fray, this time from developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment,</strong> a team made up of former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> and <strong>Titanfall 2</strong> developers, launched just two weeks ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/">January 26, 2026.</a></strong> Today, <strong>February 11, 2026,</strong> a little more than two weeks since launch, the studio confirmed it had a round of <strong>layoffs.</strong></p>



<p>Individual developers across multiple branches, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427501095955914752/?ref=aftermath.site">principal</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427500304054693890/?ref=aftermath.site">senior</a> members of staff, shared the news on their LinkedIn accounts before the studio made a statement of its own on the official Wildlight Entertainment X (formerly Twitter) account.</p>



<p>"<em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game</em>," the studio's statement begins. "<em>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful for our players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be part of our community</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Though Wildlight doesn't provide an exact figure, at least two of the developers who shared they had been impacted described it as "<em><strong>most</strong></em><strong>"<em> </em></strong>of the team getting cut, with all of their statements really driving home the tragedy of the situation.</p>



<p>"<em>Today I was laid off from my job at Wildlight along with most of the staff</em>," writes lead tech artist, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427497173774225409/?ref=aftermath.site">Josh Sobel</a></strong>. "<em>It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before. I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ years for anything. <strong>I'm still spinning</strong>, and I won't be in a place to start thinking about the future for a while, but please keep me in mind if, in the near future, you're looking for a senior or higher level rigger</em>."</p>



<p>It's clear that Highguard did not land how Wildlight wanted it to. The studio leadership's decision to slot it into <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> with a trailer that, unfortunately, did not properly convey what the game is to players, followed by complete silence, into an attempt at making it a shadow-dropped hit left players with nothing but confusion going into it and a skeptical approach when servers were turned on.</p>



<p>Once the game was live and a few of the game's more glaring cracks were shown, those who tuned in at launch dropped it like a lead balloon. The studio's leaders <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">apologized for how the launch was handled</a> while players on Steam were relentless, showering Highguard with negative reviews.</p>



<p>To the studio's credit, it acted quickly to try and address player feedback, <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412">adding a 5v5 mode</a> to ratchet up the intensity as players complained about boring matches, but that hasn't turned things around fast enough for Wildlight's leadership and bean counters. The only thing that has changed about Highguard in an instant is the size of the team working on it, which ultimately only makes it more difficult for the studio to try and put a better foot forward than what they brought to launch.</p>



<p>Sobel isn't the only one who describes their team or their time at Wildlight with such high praise, and it all makes you wonder why this keeps happening. Why studios are spun up and formed in a way that is continually deemed to be unsustainable without serious cuts to the only thing of real value a new studio has: its team.</p>



<p>It's not impossible for Wildlight to turn things around. We've seen studios do it before. But it is now beyond tiring to still see studios invest so much effort, time, and money in games where everything rests on the hope that it'll be the next <strong>Fortnite</strong>, and if it doesn't hit that mark right away, cut to plan B of laying off as many people as possible and hope you can become the next <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/">No Man's Sky</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Diablo 4’s Lord of Hatred DLC overhauls skill trees, adds talismans, the Horadric Cube, and introduces long-awaited loot filters.</p>



<p>During the 30th-anniversary Diablo presentation on February 11, it was announced that the Warlock class was coming to 3 Diablo games, including Diablo 4.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was announced that major updates would overhaul parts of Diablo 4, with the Lord of Hatred update coming in April. One of those updates is a major change to how skill trees work.</p>



<p>The team even joked about hearing players call skill trees “skill twigs,” but that is coming to an end.</p>



<p>“We’re adding new customization options to every single skill across the entire tree,” they revealed. “It isn’t just a small tweak, it’s a major disruption to the current class system.”</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-skill-tree-updates-are-coming-to-every-class-in-diablo-4">Skill Tree Updates Are Coming to Every Class in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>It was stated that every class will receive skill tree updates with more than 40 choices and over 80 additional options. Those who purchased the Lord of Hatred DLC will have 20 additional transformative skill options.</p>



<p>Plus, they’re introducing talismans, which will add even more adjustments to your characters. The DLC is also introducing the Horadric Cube, another way to continue shaping your endgame journey. They also excitedly announced that loot filters are finally being added to give players more control over their items.</p>

<p>If you plan on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> on the Switch 2 this week, be ready for a day one update bumping the new software up to Version 1.0.1.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68671">official patch notes</a> on Nintendo's support page, the development team has apparently addressed "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience". However, it doesn't specify what exactly has been updated. If we find out what has changed, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Perhaps, more importantly, this launch update is required to access the game's Switch Online features. Once you've updated to this version, you'll no longer be able to play locally or via LAN with older versions of the game - so make sure you are running the same update when playing together with family and friends.</p><div><figure data-videoid="R703wKSF5X4" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytR703wKSF5X4" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R703wKSF5X4?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8b0932uoxzhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>As our reviewer PJ O'Reilly mentioned in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever review</a>, the main adventure mode is a bit of a letdown, and solo players don't have a lot of options, but there's depth and strategy at the core here that should see this one ace things online for some time to come. So you'll want to get online play up and running!</p>
