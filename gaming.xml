<p>There’s some confusion surrounding New World, with Amazon Games announcing the upcoming Aeternum for October. Most people are unclear whether this is a brand-new game, an expansion, or a total revamp of the MMORPG. We’re hoping to clear up the matter for you by going over everything we know about New World: Aeternum.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-new-world-aeternum">What is New World: Aeternum?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>New World: Aeternum is a massive overhaul of the MMORPG New World by developer Amazon Games. It features a revamped storyline,  improved dialogue and cinematics, a large-scale PvP zone, additional raid content, solo trials, and a slew of bug fixes and technical improvements under the hood. </p>



<p>For everyone on the fence about New World, Aeternum is a total revamp that overhauls the core experience and gameplay, ensuring a more streamlined, fluid, and fun experience. It seems like a good time to hop into the MMO!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-new-world-aeternum-release">When Does New World: Aeternum Release?</h2>



<p>New World: Aeternum launches on October 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you own a copy of New World and Rise of the Angry Earth on PC, you will receive the update utterly free that day. There’s no need to buy an additional copy of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-a-new-game">Is New World: Aeternum a New Game?</h2>



<p>New World: Aeternum is not an entirely new game but more of a content update/revamp for the original New World that enhances the experience and provides access to all available content for those who buy the relaunch. Furthermore, for the first time, New World will be released on consoles—PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-free-to-play">Is New World: Aeternum Free to Play?</h2>



<p>No, New World: Aeternum is not a free-to-play game. It will cost money to buy the title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. However, if you own New World and its expansion, Rise of the Angry Earth, on PC, you’ll receive the overhaul completely free on launch day. You must buy a copy if you don’t own the game. If you don’t own the expansion, you must buy it before unlocking access to all available content in Aeternum.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-multiplayer">Is New World: Aeternum Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is a total revamp of the core MMORPG experience, multiplayer does remain at the heart of the game. New World: Aeternum will offer solo play, small group content, and large-scale PvP content for end-game players who want.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-new-world-aeternum-have-cross-progression">Does New World: Aeternum Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, no. New World: Aeternum does not offer cross-progression, so if you wish to play the game on both PC and PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, you must purchase individual copies on one or more platforms and start new characters on both servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-cross-platform">Is New World: Aeternum Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>Yes! New World: Aeternum does offer cross-platform play between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on day one when the game launches on October 15. However, it’s unclear whether all servers will be cross-platform or if there will be specific servers for the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-difference-with-new-world-aeternum">What is the Difference With New World: Aeternum?</h2>



<p>New World: Aternum features many performance and quality-of-life improvements, additional content, and access to all available content for new players and those who purchase a copy of the game, such as on one of the consoles. This new content includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10-Player Raid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pvp Zone</strong></li>



<li><strong>Endgame Soul Trials</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gear Score Increase to 725</strong></li>



<li><strong>Matchmaking</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crossworld Arenas</strong></li>



<li><strong>Upleveled Cutlass Keys Zone (Quests, Enemies, Etc.)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Performance and QOL Improvements</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cinematic Storytelling</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cross-Platform Play</strong></li>



<li><strong>Player Archetypes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fresh Start Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller Support</strong></li>



<li><strong>DX12 Rendering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Combat Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-worth-playing">Is New World Worth Playing?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’re going to receive a mixed response whenever you ask this question. Some people genuinely enjoy the game, and I was one of those people for a long time. However, I quickly grew weary of the many issues plaguing the experience, especially the poor server performance, which forced me to look for other MMORPGs to play.</p>



<p>That said, while playing the game, I did enjoy my time. It offers one of the genre’s best crafting and gathering mechanics, and the combat is rather entertaining. I’m curious to see what improvements they’ve made for Aeternum. If you own the game and its expansion, there’s no reason not to download Aeternum in October to check out what’s new!</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rayman-is-becoming-a-board-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-rayman-is-becoming-a-board-game.987969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rayman-is-becoming-a-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Rayman’s limbless brand of anarchic puzzle-platforming has been delighting fans since 1995, with five main video games and a number of spin-offs, across multiple systems. But one play Rayman has yet to save from the forces of evil is your tabletop. Now that’s about to change thanks to the upcoming Rayman: The Board Game (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyosgames/rayman-the-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see it on Kickstarter</a>), a collaboration between Ubisoft and Flyos games on the one hand, and three designers on the other: Maxime Tardif, creator of critically acclaimed, best-selling title <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVXr0?object_uuid=abfb8b87-8ac3-4671-a1a4-001b62c5c84e&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth</a>, one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>best strategy board games</u></a>, alongside Gary Paitre and Thomas Filippi of Flyos. </p><p>What unites the trio is a love for the source material. “We really wanted to see our favorite eggplant hero back in action,” laughs Filippi. “The games are all about having fun, a bit of chaos, and some friendly competition, and we felt that vibe would be perfect for a board game setting.” The resulting board game has been designed to be playable by all ages, and includes solo and cooperative modes and different difficult levels alongside the head-to-head competition you’d expect.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-2-1726846976417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Having a family-friendly vibe was important to the developers, not least because they have children of their own. “When I play with my young daughters, I usually stick to with the rookie and intermediate modes,” Filippi reveals. “But when I face team members, we can play more aggressively.” He also feels that it’s one way in which the game channels the essence of its source material. “Rayman is a positive character, always smiling, making him perfect for younger players,” he continues. “The humor, the smooth action, and those imaginative worlds, all of it adds up to something special.”</p><p>With so many different video games to draw on, the team decided to blend the two most contemporary titles to form the basis for their game, but one of them took the fore. “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review"><u>Rayman Legends</u></a> felt like a natural fit as it’s the most recent game in the series,” explains co-designer Gary Paitre. “And honestly, we wanted to include Barbara! She’s got such a cool vibe. The musical levels, in which you run in rhythm while making quick and sharp decisions, was also a big source of inspiration. However, some elements from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/10/rayman-origins-review"><u>Rayman Origins</u></a> are also included, such as missiles.” These zip around the board, providing dangerous dynamic hazards that the players must avoid.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rayman Legends felt like a natural fit as it’s the most recent game in the series</p></div><p>Besides Rayman himself, the two other characters featured in the game are Globox and Murfy. Each has a miniature figure to use on the board, but in the basic game they’re mechanically the same, each having an identical deck of action cards that lets them run, jump and glide around the board, slapping enemies, and avoiding obstacles, just like in the computer games. Keeping all the basic decks the same was a deliberate design choice. “In the video game, each hero has the same set of actions,” Paitre points out. “What makes your adventure unique is how you choose to apply those actions.”</p><p>As players gain confidence, however, they can make their chosen character more unique by including special ability cards keyed to each personality. “It’s a little light asymmetry, to add some variety,” says Filippi. Paitre fills in the details. “They let you choose which actions you prefer,” he explains. “You can have more initiative, or focus on slapping. They help make every game different, and we’ve tried to ensure that no hero is stronger than another.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-7-1726846976419.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>With all the attention paid to tying in the board game to its source material, fans might be surprised to discover that Rayman The Board Game is a race game. This seems rather different from the standard platforming levels in Rayman Legends, but there’s a good reason. “It’s inspired by the time-trial runs from the video games,” says Filippi. “We wanted that same feeling of intensity and quick thinking in the board game. It’s not just about getting from point A to B fast; it’s about making smart moves, keeping an eye on what everyone else is doing, and maybe throwing a wrench in their plans. We wanted each playthrough to have that unpredictable, ‘anything can happen’ feel that makes Rayman games so fun.” There are still Teensies, Rayman’s magical friends, to save along the way, and you’ll need to have rescued three of them to take the win.</p><p>During each turn, players secretly select a pair of action cards for that round, which are added together to give a total value of in-game moves like jumping and slapping. These tie into the features on the racetrack, so you’ll need to jump to gain access to platforms, slap enemies in your path and glide over gaps and there are multiple paths around each board that you’ll need to assess strategically to gain an edge. The cards you chose are discarded and, to get them back, you need to take a “bubble” action, skipping a turn and falling behind in the race in exchange for temporary immunity and the chance to pick up and re-use your discards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fans might be surprised to discover that Rayman The Board Game is a race game.</p></div><p>Getting this right is a surprisingly cerebral and challenging task: almost every card selection will see you wasting actions or falling short in some way of what you actually want to do. The tactics are in optimizing your available cards to the track before you. Doing so can cause players a bit of analysis paralysis as they work through the options, which gives the game plenty of depth but isn’t necessarily a close fit for the frenetic pace of parts of the original video games, something that’s true of a lot of video-to-board game adaptations.</p><p>Filippi acknowledges that this was a challenge for the team. “We wanted to keep that feeling of intensity but also add some depth that you can only get in a tabletop setting,” he says. But he feels they got the balance right. “You still have those moments of quick action, but mixed with the need to think ahead, which is just like navigating a tricky platform level. You have to plan your moves, and figure out when to go all out or when to hold back.” And he thinks there’s a payoff for introducing more analytical elements, too. “It offers that same sense of accomplishment when you pull off a great move or outsmart your friends.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-4-1726846976418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Bringing in third designer Maxime Tardiff to work on the game was, in part, an attempt to meet that challenge. “At first, Gary and I wanted to make that game ourselves," Filippi continues. “But we decided to bring an experienced designer to the table. He was a perfect match, passionate, smart and accessible. His input was crucial for refining the action decks, the level structures and the solo and cooperative mode. He pushed us to elevate and balance the gameplay even further, like integrating the asymmetric elements.”</p><p>Flyos have worked on a race game before, 2017’s <a href="https://www.kiwetin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwetin</a> in which the players chase each other through a fantasy forest. It has similarities to Rayman: The Board Game, with players collecting action tiles to speed them on their way, but they’re largely superficial. Movement in Kiwetin is dice-based, for example, whereas in Rayman it’s totally down to the player’s decisions. Nevertheless, they learned a lot of lessons from developing and producing it that they were able to apply to their latest project. “It was our first crack at both board games and crowdfunding, and it taught us a lot about balance and keeping things replayable,” Patire explains”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-6-1726846976418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There were, however, lots of other board games the team did draw on in their quest to bring Rayman to the tabletop. One was popular, family-friend car-racing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heat-pedal-to-the-metal-board-game-review"><u>Heat</u></a>. “It gave us a great feel for how to make a fast-paced racing game exciting with its immediate reveal phase,” Paitre explains. Their other major influence was a little more unexpected: dungeon-crawling campaign behemoth <a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV?object_uuid=abfb8b87-8ac3-4671-a1a4-001b62c5c84e&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a>. “That helped us think about depth in cooperative gameplay,” he continues. “Playing two cards at once from your hand and improvising a new plan last second is a feature, not a bug,” he laughs. “But we didn’t just copy those games, it’s about mixing the best elements of what we love to create something that feels like Rayman.”</p><p>While the game is currently in a fully playable state, Filippi admits that, like a lot of crowd-funded games, there’s still a bit of work to do to fully realize its potential. “The balancing isn’t fully finalized yet but, so far, the winning player is never too far ahead of the last, which keeps the excitement high until the end,” he says. Talking to them both, it’s a delight to see how committed they are to the source material, and how proud they are of the opportunity to bring it to the table. “Seeing it come to life is truly a dream come true,” Filippi beams. Rayman fans all over the world will soon be able to judge for themselves how well that dream has been translated into reality.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyosgames/rayman-the-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>You can find out more about Rayman The Board Game, and back it, on Kickstarter.</em></u></a></p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

<p>After assuring players it had "spent the last several months listening carefully to the feedback you've shared", the team then sought to assuage the fears of those with the Year One Pass.</p>
<p>"With the changes we're making, we want to assure those of you who purchased the Year One Pass that you will be getting everything we've previously promised. Additionally, we've made modifications to our plans to include elements requested by the community," the team added.</p>

<p>"We thank you for your patience as we work to deliver our post-launch vision for Homeworld 3 in November," the team concludes. "Many other elements are coming beyond what we unpacked above including new gameplay mechanics, optimisations to existing features, as well as bug fixes and performance improvements."</p>
<p>"25 years after the original Homeworld and 22 years after the (weaker) second mainline installment, Homeworld 3 doesn't hit that high bar to eclipse its predecessors and become the new best Homeworld," Will wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/homeworld-3-review">Homeworld 3 review</a>, in which he awarded the game three stars out of five.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the time of writing, God of War Ragnarök sits on a "mixed" user score amalgamated from almost 5000 player reviews. The majority of negative reviews mention their dismay at having to connect to a PSN account to play a single-player game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, several reviewers say they've been able to play the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084783543/recommended/2322010/">without</a> linking a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198309809471/recommended/2322010/">PSN account</a> at all.</p>
<p>Others are unhappy that even creating a PSN account in a country where the service is available <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/brian22/recommended/2322010/">requires</a> "submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age [...] or submit a photograph of your face or a government-issued ID to a third party site".</p>
<p>"I get why people are upset about the PlayStation account stuff. It sucks when developers stuff online features into a single-player game," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199383311197/recommended/2322010/">said</a> one positive reviewer.</p>
<p>"But I don't even understand because I could play fine without logging in. It sucks because those reviews are gonna turn people away from an incredible game."</p>
<p>"The fact that this game, a SINGLEPLAYER game, forces you to sign in to a network which is notorious for data breaches is absolutely ridiculous," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1#scrollTop=3803.333251953125">countered</a> a negative reviewer.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the fact that I adored the first game and that I wanted to play this one since it came out on PlayStation, I wouldn't have bought this game at all. Extremely scummy behaviour from Sony here."</p>

<p>Others have left negative reviews due to the "state of the game", reporting "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">constant crashes, audio bugs, visual bugs, ultra low FPS</a>", and issues even getting the game to "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2322010/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1#scrollTop=3803.333251953125">open</a>" at all.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök arrived on PC this week, offering a newly upgraded version of the PlayStation hit with a raft of graphical upgrades and new PC-specific features. To mark the occasion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-big-god-of-war-ragnorak-pc-tech-interview">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia spoke to Matt DeWald</a>, lead producer at original developers Sony Santa Monica, and Steve Tolin, technical director of PC port developers Jetpack Interactive.</p>
<p>You may remember plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">discourse around the high frequency of puzzle hints in God of War Ragnarök</a>.

The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he’s <em>also</em> a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It’s a game with all the fixings of a kids’ classic, something that can be shared with the children in one’s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that <em>The Plucky Squire </em>actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite ‘90s RPG late at night.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>,</a></span> made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812">old-school Xbox 360-era game</a></span>.

It takes place in a storybook world rendered in an adorable two dimensions thanks to codirector and former <em>Pokémon</em> artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesturner_42/">James Turner</a>. But at certain points, the heroic lead character can venture into the real world and solve puzzles that mix 2D and 3D in inventive ways. Sometimes, you’re moving objects between dimensions; other times, you’re rearranging the words in a book to create new outcomes. It’s as cute as it is creative, and it follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Sony’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a> in what is turning out to be a very good year for family-friendly games.</p><p>The game puts you in the role of Jot, the titular plucky squire, who has the unusual ability to exist outside of the book he stars in. The two worlds are drastically different: inside the storybook is bright, colorful, and simple, while the real world is appropriately dark and realistic. They’re distinct, but through Jot, the worlds intersect as he sets about saving the book from an evil wizard. Solving puzzles involves flipping through pages to pull items from the past, using language to bypass barriers, and occasionally boxing a bear. It’s silly and heartfelt and, at times, calls to mind the 2D segments in Nintendo classics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/14/5103870/legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-gets-back-to-series-roots"><em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em></a>.</p><div><p>“The idea of contrast was really important to the game.”</p></div><p>For Turner, the initial idea for the game came during a lull, when he had just left <em>Pokémon</em> developer Game Freak but hadn’t yet started work at All Possible Futures, the studio he cofounded with Jonathan Biddle. “I left Game Freak, and then I had nothing to do,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “To fill that void, I started drawing a webcomic.” That comic, called <a href="https://x.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1289693386849411072"><em>Cosmic</em></a>, included a number of characters and ideas that would eventually make their way into <em>The Plucky Squire</em> as its storybook narrative took shape.</p><p>For Turner — who frequently posts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesturner_42/p/C91eDvWqS8K/?hl=en">hilarious mashup illustrations</a> and who designed notable pokémon like <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Polteageist_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Polteageist</a> — one of the goals of the game was to create a unique clash of styles. Not only should the dimensions in <em>The Plucky Squire</em> play different, but they should look different as well. It’s an idea that came about early in development; initially, when Jot jumped into the real world, he was cel-shaded to keep his cartoony style. Eventually, though, it became clear that a more realistic, almost toy-like version of the character worked better.</p><div><p><cite>Image: All Possible Futures</cite></p></div><p>“It reduced the realism of the outside world quite significantly in a strange way,” Turner says of the cel shading. “Even though the outside world was very real, if the object that you’re looking at 90 percent of the time [isn’t], it starts to affect how you see the rest of the world.” He adds that “the idea of contrast was really important to the game.”</p><p>A good example is early on in <em>The Plucky Squire</em> when Jot is in search of a bow-and-arrow to complete a quest. This involves jumping through a portal into the real world, navigating a very messy desk filled with obstacles, and then jumping into a card ripped out of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> to battle an elf. When Jot finally reaches his destination, there are three distinct art styles onscreen: storybook 2D, realistic 3D, and detailed fantasy art. “I thought that clash of styles would be the most jaw-dropping,” Turner explains.</p><div><p>“There’s a big gap outside of Nintendo.”</p></div><p>Outside of its visuals, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is also notable for being an experience that works really well for all ages. The action and puzzles have just enough depth to them to be satisfying while not being intimidating for younger or less experienced players. It’s like a streamlined <em>Zelda</em> adventure, with some nice quality-of-life features, like an optional hint system that doesn’t give too much away. It’s a style of game that can be hard to find outside of something from Nintendo (which includes the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>). But titles like <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>The Plucky Squire</em> are showing it’s possible for other developers, as well.</p><p>“There are lots of people that want to play those games, and they haven’t been catered to as much as they possibly should have been,” says Turner. “It does feel like there’s a big gap outside of Nintendo where it would be nice if we had those games more regularly. There’s a need for them.”</p><p><small>The Plucky Squire <em>is out now on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Don't be afraid. Darkness is a good thing," says a gravely voice as animated night-vision goggles sink into water.</p>
<p>We then see an older, grey-haired man similarly sink beneath the surface of the water, and cut to a wreath-covered coffin. The name blazoned across it is "beloved father" Douglas Shetland.</p>
<p>"Once you get used to the shadows, you see bad people for who they really are."</p>
<p>Fisher fans fear not, though – after we cut away from the coffin, bold text tells us that Sam Fisher is in the series, too, and is voiced by Hollywood actor, Liev Schreiber.</p>
<p>"And they'll never see you coming for them."</p>
<p>We then hear, then see, night-vision goggles powering up.</p>
<p>If you can't wait for more Fisher fun, don't forget that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/step-aside-netflix-splinter-cell-is-getting-a-bbc-radio-4-adaptation">BBC recently adapted the Splinter Cell series for radio</a>.

Or maybe we shouldn’t have done <em>Connections</em> on an empty stomach.<br></p><p>Today’s blue group answer is <strong>“Great Job!” </strong>and its words are <strong>IMPRESSIVE, NICE, PROPS</strong>, and <strong>WELL DONE.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ec8fa2a21b88d7d168c2438a6b1c62a5" data-recommend-id="image://ec8fa2a21b88d7d168c2438a6b1c62a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2333" data-height="1303" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec8fa2a21b88d7d168c2438a6b1c62a5" data-recommend-id="image://ec8fa2a21b88d7d168c2438a6b1c62a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2333" data-height="1303" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The purple group is the hardest one, so don’t kick yourself if this visual hint does not immediately take you to the promised land.</p><p>Here’s your verbal clue if you’re not into Mixed Martial Arts: Get your Britspeak on for one of these words, and your <em>Bill and Ted</em> for another.<br></p><p>Crying uncle? This was our process-of-elimination group today, probably as the <em>Times</em>’ puzzlemaster intended. Oh, and that imaginary fifth group?
