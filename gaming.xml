            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.</p>
<p>The iconic brand has successfully translated their <strong>legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers</strong> that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/"> At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Re-Engineered Soundstage</h2>
<p>The third-generation design expands the <strong>stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models</strong> through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.</p>
<p>The Marshall signature sound <strong>emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character</strong> that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.</p>



<p>Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker <strong>with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementation</strong>&nbsp;which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.</p>
<p>Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional <strong>wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available</strong> for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and y<strong>ou’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box</strong>. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. <strong>The speaker has tactile, analog controls</strong> at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.</p>
<p>The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="519">LEGO is a timeless toy that continues to capture the hearts of people of all ages. It’s not just for kids. Anyone with a sense of nostalgia or creativity can dive into the fun. LEGO has a vast array of collaborations with different fandoms, and perhaps one of its most popular partnerships is with Marvel. Among the many sets inspired by the Marvel universe is one based on the most iconic scene from the second film in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, and its now available at a discounted price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">This particular LEGO set of the Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train showdown typically sells for $55, but it’s currently on sale for 20% off, bringing the price down to $44</a>. This price drop makes it a great deal for any LEGO fan or Spider-Man enthusiast looking to recreate one of the most memorable moments from the early 2000s Spider-Man films.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="519">Most Iconic&nbsp;Spider-Man Moment</h2>
<p data-start="867" data-end="1630">If you were a teenager during the mid-2000s, you probably fondly remember <em data-start="941" data-end="955">Spider-Man 2</em>, the sequel to the 2002 blockbuster. The movie remains a fan favorite and is often cited as the best of the trilogy and even all the Spider-Man film adaptations. Spoilers for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> I guess&nbsp; but, for many, the standout scene from this movie is the subway sequence, where Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man must save a runaway train from crashing. In this scene, Spider-Man, after losing his mask, uses his webs to slow down the train, and in the end, the New York City passengers agree to keep his identity a secret.</p>
<p data-start="1632" data-end="2357">The LEGO set that pays tribute to this unforgettable scene contains 393 pieces and includes not only a detailed train model but also four minifigures: Spider-Man, Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, and Aunt May. Spider-Man comes with two interchangeable heads—one masked and one unmasked—so you can replicate the scene exactly as it happened. The set also features Doc Ock with his four mechanical arms, which are adjustable and can be posed in a variety of ways. Two of the arms are equipped with laser beams, while the other two can attach to the train to create that intense showdown. Though not actually present during this scene in the movie, J. Jonah Jameson and Aunt May are included just to fill out the set. I guess they’re more recognizable than the kid who returns Peter’s mask.</p>


<p data-start="2359" data-end="2692">The completed set measures over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide, making it a perfect size to display once you’ve finished building it. The roof of the train is removable, allowing you to take a closer look at the interior details, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p data-start="3194" data-end="3606" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a Spider-Man fan or simply someone who love to collect LEGO, this set offers a great way to relive a classic moment from the <em data-start="3324" data-end="3338">Spider-Man 2</em> movie. And with the current discount, you can save $11 when bringing home this piece of cinematic history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem features a brand-new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, and the devs recently spoke about how she differs from other protagonists. </p>



<p>Capcom seems to be cooking up a storm with Resident Evil Requiem, and the anticipation is only going higher as the release date draws closer. Recently, the developers revealed during an interview that the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from previous games</a>. Now, the producer has opened up about how Requiem’s Grace is different from other main characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-grace-is-an-ordinary-person-but-is-a-bit-more-used-to-guns">Resident Evil Requiem’s Grace is An Ordinary Person, But is a ‘Bit More Used to Guns’ </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2025/11/we-speak-with-producer-masato-kumazawa-about-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CheckpointGaming</a>, Resident Evil Requiem’s producer Masato Kumazawa was asked to talk about Grace. Kumazawa explained that the whole point is “scaring the players,” and, from his perspective, “she is the most scared or easily prone to being scared protagonist in the series.” The producer added that he wants other players to “be scared with her and enjoy the atmosphere with her,” noting that “she’s an ordinary person.” </p>



<p>However, Requiem’s Grace is an FBI Analyst, which makes her well-versed with guns. At the same time, when comparing characters like Chris and Leon, “they’re not like, ‘Oh, we get a gun, and we start shooting everything,’ or we get to close combat and have no problem.” When talking about ordinary, Kumazawa believes that Ethan is “the most ordinary in terms of just saying normal”; Grace is just a bit more used to guns than he is. </p>



<p>Kumazawa added that Grace is not an expert like Leon or Chris. They aim to make players feel they have limited resources and to have them figure out “what they can do with the limited amount of things that they have.” The game is closer to “classic type of horror survival,” but it’s not all classic as there are “new elements and new weapons in order to make it more fun.”</p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely has at least one DLC in development</a>. Additionally, the upcoming title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to sell better than RE Village</a>.

            <p>Roblox's CEO has called the problem of predators on the platform an "opportunity", as the company updates its safety measures with age verification checks.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">announced back in September</a>, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">Roblox has expanded its age estimation technology</a> to all users wishing to communicate with others. Back in July it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">introduced an AI to estimate a user's age through video selfies</a>, partly in response to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Online Safety Act</a>. This is now required by all users.</p>
<p>Roblox is predominantly used by children and teenagers, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">report last year claimed Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. As a result, the company is taking steps to improve child safety, with AI at its core due to the scale of the platform - over the summer, for instance, hit game Steal a Brainrot had over 25 million concurrent users.</p>
<p>However, this year three US states have filed lawsuits against Roblox over child safety issues - that's Louisiana, Kentucky, and Texas. Further, over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation have been filed in US federal court this year.</p>
<p>In this context, Roblox CEO David Baszucki appeared on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">New York Times podcast Hard Fork</a>, where hosts Casey Newton and Kevin Roose immediately asked him for his thoughts on "the problem of predators on Roblox".</p>
<p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," said Baszucki. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?</p>
<p>"At the scale we're at, 150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward?"</p>
<p>Roblox is indeed working on safety improvements, but it's shocking to hear the CEO of a major gaming platform call pedophilia an "opportunity" as it jeopardises the safety of children.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout the interview Baszucki appears focused more on promoting technological advancements and highlighting the sheer number of users on the platform, rather than the importance of child safety.</p>
<p>After discussing the use of AI filters and age estimation, Baszucki was asked how confident he is these measures are working, considering it would appear predators have found little difficulty in bypassing such measures in the past.</p>
<p>"I don't want to comment on it," Baszucki replied. He added, in a response generally avoiding the question: "It's one of the primary things we're doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It's an interesting industry situation. I would say, we're not waiting for the rest of the industry. We're like, we're always trying to stay ahead of it."</p><p>Baszucki was then asked outright "You don't think you have a problem with predators on the platform?", to which he responded: "I think we're doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning into the future of how this is going to work."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Baszucki also argued the benefits of having open-ended text communication in Roblox, despite potential issues with safety. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox," he said as part of his response. "There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually - I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything - but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with'."</p>
<p>After Baszucki mentioned the "mind-blogging" scale of the platform, the hosts brought up a report from Hindenburg Research that claimed Roblox was "compromising child safety in order to report growth to investors". Baszucki dismissed the allegation.</p>
<p>"Fun," he said. "Let's keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is no longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason."</p>
<p>Eventually, in an effort to avoid further questioning, Baszucki tried to manipulate the hosts into agreeing with his views on AI success, and joked "is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we're doing and you're here to stealthily support it?" He later added: "I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that. So I'm not frustrated, I'm just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus."</p>
<p>Eventually the conversation turned to Polymarket, a crypto-currency prediction platform where users place bets on future events through a blockchain network.</p>
<p>Baszucki, it would appear, is a fan of the platform. And when jokingly asked if he would put a prediction market in Roblox - essentially allowing children to gamble - he said "we would", but noted the need to account for different legislation around the world.</p><p>When the hosts stated this was a "horrible idea", Baszucki replied: "Well, I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for further comment on the interview.</p>
<p>It's a disastrous interview, following other instances from Baszucki. Back in 2024, he told Eurogamer <a href="http://baszucki/">children making money on the platform isn't exploitation but a gift</a>. Then, earlier this year, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">told the BBC parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox</a> if they are "not comfortable" about their in-game safety.</p>

<p>Square Enix and PlatinumGames' sci-fi ARPG has long been sitting in a pretty bad way on Switch 2, with many users reporting frequent crashes when trying to get it up and running on the new hardware. A glance at <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-GB/details/010056b015fe8000">Nintendo's compatibility information site</a> <em>before</em> today listed NieR: Automata as "Unsupported - Problems with game progression have been found", but that all seems to be in the rear-view as of system update 21.0.1.</p><div><figure data-videoid="O4v-ia_qhCE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytO4v-ia_qhCE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405204gtvurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>As of 25th November 2025 (that's today), the game's listing has been updated as "supported" on Switch 2, with the note that "previously identified issues have been fixed".</p>
<p>It's a welcome change, because NieR: Automata <em>ruled</em> on Switch 1, and now we have the perfect excuse to dive in all over again. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/nierautomata-the-end-of-yorha-edition">our 9/10 review</a> of the initial Switch release, we described Automata as "a top-notch port that has clearly been produced with respect and focus, often surpassing our expectations in both visuals and performance". *<em>Sigh</em>* as if we didn't already have enough backlog games to get through before the year is up...</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams-2000647178</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360%C2%B0-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams.1363939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Insta360 has stolen market share from GoPro and DJI in recent years as it transformed from an upstart challenger into the definitive action camera brand that content creators and adventure people reach for first. It’s been the combination of innovative <strong>360-degree capture, AI-powered editing and useful features</strong> like the invisible selfie stick effect that positioned Insta360 as the company pushing boundaries while established competitors iterated incrementally.</p>
<p>The X5 launched in April as its feature-packed flagship model justifying the premium positioning, but this Black Friday brings the first significant discount: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/">At $464, down from $549, this 8K 360-degree camera has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon and delivers everything that made Insta360 the action camera leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K Resolution That Captures Everything</h2>
<p>The dual 1/1.28-inch sensors work together to <strong>capture 8K resolution at 30fps across the full 360-degree field of view</strong> for footage that has incredible detail and survives aggressive cropping and reframing in post with ease. This resolution counts because 360-degree cameras need excess capture area so you can choose your framing after the fact rather than commit to an angle at the time of recording. These larger sensors also improve on low-light performance, color accuracy, and dynamic range compared to the smaller sensors on competing action cameras and turn out footage that looks professional.</p>



<p>This game-changing, t<strong>riple AI chip design distributes processing across specialized silicon for real-time noise reduction, image processing, and AI-assisted features</strong> – all operating concurrently without thermal throttling or performance compromise. But this architecture really lets you fly when shooting in tough low-light conditions that leave competitors’ cameras producing unusable grainy footage, delivering clean video even during those golden hours, indoor scenes, or nighttime adventures. Advanced features such as auto subject-tracking, horizon leveling, and smart reframing-all using AI to analyze 360-degree footage for ideal crop point suggestions that capture the action-are powered by onboard AI processing.</p>
<p>The<strong> invisible selfie stick effect is Insta360’s signature feature</strong> which creates impossible third-person perspectives that make it seem like a drone or cameraman is following you. It captures 360 degrees of everything, including the extended selfie stick, which the stitching algorithm intelligently removes from the final footage via geometric analysis and image processing. That gives you the cinematic shots you dream of: a floating camera tracking your movements in places that feel professionally filmed but are completely self-operated.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization combined with 360-degree Horizon Lock eliminates the need for gimbals through computational stabilization, analyzing motion and then correcting it through post-processing. Stabilization handles aggressive movements, bumps, crashes, and full camera rotations while maintaining level, smooth footage that looks professionally stabilized. The horizon lock specifically ensures the horizon line stays perfectly level regardless of how the camera tumbles or rotates during action sequences, preventing the disorienting tilted footage that ruins otherwise great action shots.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens system is a practical innovation in itself as it protects your investment by allowing quick lens swaps the moment scratches, cracks, or damage occur. Traditional action cameras require expensive repairs or an outright replacement when lenses get damaged in crashes, drops, or impacts that inevitably occur during action sports. The <strong>X5’s lenses detach and replace in mere seconds</strong> without requiring tools, thus enabling one to take spare lenses along on extended trips or adventures where lens damage becomes likely.</p>
<p>The <strong>advanced 4-microphone array</strong> captures clearer audio by first reducing the amount of wind interference that usually ruins action camera soundtracks. It does this through several microphones placed strategically around the camera body, combined with AI processing that identifies and suppresses wind noise while preserving voice and ambient sounds.</p>
<p>At $464, the Insta360 X5 brings 8K 360-degree video, triple AI chip processing, invisible selfie stick compatibility, FlowState stabilization, replaceable lenses, and enhanced wind reduction at 15% off retail this Black Friday. Insta360 remains the market leader over GoPro and DJI not because of incremental spec bumps but rather through relentless innovation in features that actually matter to content creators.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shaves-a-whopping-80-off-the-15-inch-dell-inspiron-3530-but-the-discount-ends-soon-2000647081</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-clears-out-the-2025-laptop-at-80-off-as-remaining-stock-runs-low-redragon-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse-included.1363936/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time to upgrade your tech for less. Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are coming in hot. Those looking to grab a new laptop this shopping season, whether for themselves or a loved one, should consider bagging the heavily discounted 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3530 at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">This machine typically retails for around $4,000, but Amazon is offering it at a whopping 80% discount, which brings the down to just $798.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a Redragon keyboard and mouse kit for absolutely nothing. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you’re saving on that front as well.</p>
<p>The only catch? This deal, at the time of writing, is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members will still see it at its normal, not-so-friendly $4,000 tag. That said, if you’re planning to shop heavy during the main event, now is a good time to jump on a Prime membership. It lets you enjoy fast, free shipping with your purchases, access member-only deals, and unlock early discounts. The retailer offers a 30-day free trial to new users. After that, you can expect to pay around $15 a month.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete, Ready-to-Go Setup</h2>
<p>In a fairly minimal design, the laptop offers a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen. 220 nits of brightness push clear, vibrant visuals, while the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. Touch support makes navigation a breeze. Not in the mood to use the trackpad or drag the mouse around? Just use your fingers directly on the screen to perform tasks. Pinch for a wider view, stretch to zoom in, swipe away, scroll long documents, or maybe use the on-screen keyboard to take notes; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Just above the screen is a solid 720p HD webcam that makes it easy to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external camera.</p>
<p>This machine runs on the updated 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor, which handles both everyday school and work tasks like a pro. The chip is paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM for snappier multitasking, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for quicker boot times. You’ll be able to perform a whole bunch of tasks (researching, writing, taking video calls) simultaneously without a hint of lag, which makes the laptop ideal for creatives who need to hop through different programs at the same time. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of space to store your important data, whether it’s hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, or unusually large research papers. The capacity should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re looking to house ever-growing libraries of media files without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Connectivity options are plenty. You’ll enjoy a stable, wireless connection with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, plus be able to connect a range of external peripherals using the built-in ports. Speaking of peripherals, the free kit gets you a solid Redragon laptop keyboard and mouse. The former is quite lightweight and comes with detachable keys. The mouse has a sturdy feel, and is quite comfortable to use for longer sessions.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, meaning you don’t have to worry about any complicated installation procedures to get started. Microsoft has loaded the operating system with a bunch of useful productivity and security features that are ideal for remote workers, business owners, creatives, and even students. Just note that Microsoft Office isn’t included, and you will need to purchase it separately later if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">Overall, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen laptop is a great option to consider for both work and play, especially at its current price. You’re saving more than $3,200 on this powerhouse.</a> Grab the deal before it’s too late.</p>

And JRPG 3.0 signifies the role-playing games coming in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the JRPG games still to come, Hashino said, "There will be a greater dimension to these games, and they'll change the genre's structure and presentation at a fundamental level."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big talking points around JRPGs revolves around combat, specifically if games like Final Fantasy should return to the turn-based combat of old. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> co-director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-may-suggest-jrpgs-are-back-but-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-co-director-is-focused-on-what-game-experience-fans-will-enjoy"><u>Naoki Hamaguchi recently reflected on features like turn-based combat</u></a> following the huge success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, which boasts traditional JRPG-inspired turn-based combat, saying: "If you would ask me, 'Is [my next game] going to be an RPG?,' yes, there is definitely a possibility. But is it going to be a turn-based RPG? We're taking this aside from the fact that Expedition 33 was received well, we received a lot of 'JRPGs are back' comments. For me, I'm thinking about what game experience fans will enjoy. That's the most important point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-developers-visited-square-enixs-offices-for-a-rich-exchange-of-ideas">It later emerged that several members of the Clair Obscur team had recently visited Square Enix's offices</a> and met with some of the development leads there, including Hamaguchi and <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1948371688338424076" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida</a>. <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a social post</a>, Hamaguchi described it as a "creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1975924077496852782" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>five million copies in five months</u></a>, making it one of the biggest hits of the year.

<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.</p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="685" data-end="1266">Cancel Out the World Around You</h2>
<p data-start="1268" data-end="1700">A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.</p>
<p data-start="1702" data-end="2038">The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplified—even in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded café or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.</p>


<p data-start="2040" data-end="2685">In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. They’re lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, don’t stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playback—enough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="3100" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is gearing up to welcome Season 1 and all of its new content across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. The Season 1 Battle Pass is the first for Black Ops 7, and Treyarch has announced sweeping changes ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Many people take exception to the live-service Battle Pass model, especially when you’ve already paid full price for a game. Some companies do it better than others, and Call of Duty passes can be hit or miss. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-battle-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Battle Pass</a> is nearly here, and Treyarch is making it better than ever.</p>

<p>Treyarch announced lots of new content for Black Ops 7 Season 1 on November 24. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-adds-new-weapons-and-attachments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons and attachments</a>, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-receives-8-new-modes-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight new modes</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-is-getting-six-new-multiplayer-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six new multiplayer maps</a>.</p>







<p>However, one of the bigger talking points emerged after the content was revealed. In a post on X, Treyarch unveiled various tweaks and adjustments to “Significantly improve the Battle Pass experience for all Black Ops 7 and Call of Duty: Warzone players.”</p>



<p>Here are the key updates:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Tuning adjustments” have been made regarding Battle Pass completion times. This should ensure every Black Ops 7 pass will be “more rewarding for the time you spend playing.”</li>



<li>“Earlier pages in the Black Ops 7 Battle Pass can now be completed faster with fewer tiers needed to unlock HVT content, while later pages will contain more rewards. This means players will earn high-value content sooner across all 100 tiers.”</li>



<li>Finally, Battle Pass Tokens can be earned through Daily Challenges—also available in Co-Op Campaign &amp; Endgame.</li>
</ul>



<p>The comments on the post were generally positive. But one key change wasn’t addressed that was frequently mentioned: Having the content be available <em>once </em>the pass expires. It remains to be seen if this is something Treyarch looks at for future Black Ops 7 Battle Passes.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>With Season 01 just around the corner, we’re excited to announce new changes to significantly improve the Battle Pass experience for all Black Ops 7 and Call of Duty: Warzone players, starting on Dec. 4th:</p><p> 1.

<p>Skate Story is the next game from Zarvot developer Sam Eng, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> on publishing duties. It will retail for £18.</p>
<p>"Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of the Underworld as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Skate fast to destroy demons and save other tortured souls on your journey from fragile beginner to a hardened skater," reads the official Skate Story blurb on Steam.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonic-skateboarding-game-skate-story-coming-in-2023">initially announced several years ago</a>, but has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-devolver-digital-is-delaying-into-2025">faced its share of delays since then</a>. But, those days are behind us now, and Skate Story's release is tantalisingly close. I do rather like the look of this one, I have to say.</p>

            <p>
The original 256GB LCD version of Valve's Steam Deck is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/">20% off till 1st December</a>, knocking it down to around $319.20 or £279.20 in the UK. It's all part of this year's Blackening of Friday, whereby whimpering price tags are shoved partway into sausage machines for the benefit of the first Xmas shoppers. 
</p>
<p>
"That's a chunk of cheddar," whistled our new editorial director Julian, a choice of words I choose to take literally, mostly because he's just ruined my sausage machine analogy. According to the UK's Office of National Statistics, cheddar was 873p a kilogram as of January 2025, the last recorded figure. Assuming that average holds true, the Steam Deck is currently worth 32 kilograms of classic farmhouse cheese. That <em>is</em> a chunk of cheddar. Good work, Julian! This is why they handed you the big boss trousers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I'm vegan, so I'm totally unswayed by all these dairy-based overtures, but even if I were one of you lactose junkies, I still wouldn't get a Steam Deck at 20% off. James loaned me one of his a year or so ago, and I was quite impressed by its ability to let me play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> lying down, but my PC gaming is half-and-half MK and controller. I already own a Switch, which has maybe a third of the best PC action-platformers on it already, and I've found that Steam Deck sucks for quintessentially desktop genres like real-time strategy. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible that this is a misapprehension born of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">lingering, amorous hatred for Mech Engineer's demo</a>, and that I'm missing out on a golden age of tightly optimised controller-native harvester raids and flanking actions. I look forward to your outraged comments in defence of portable Starcraft.</p><p>Yes, I know I can get a wireless mouse and keyboard, but if I'm going to round the thing out with accessories, why not just splurge on a basic gaming laptop with a better screen that can be used for a bunch of other things? Yes, I know you can output to your TV, but I've banished my TV to a wardrobe because the power "button" broke, and I've lost the remote. Hello, TV manufacturers! Please can you put proper fucking buttons on TVs again. A single, brittle plastic tab hidden inside the frame is not adequate for my needs.  
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I hope you'll join me in firmly rejecting Valve's cut-price Steam Deck. Think of all the cheddar you'll be able to buy with the cash you've saved, you stinky whey-fancier. Alternatively, you could put your cheese money towards the purchase of a Steam Deck OLED - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">I hear they're decent</a> - or one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">Valve's many forthcoming new gizmos</a>.</p>
<p>If you do insist on buying an original Steam Deck, I recommend reading James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck academy hub</a> (as advertised in the header), which encompasses how-to guides, accessory roundups, and game-specific performance and settings overviews. Perhaps if enough of you read that piece, James will feel magnaminous and lend me one of his again, so that I can finish being angry and frustrated at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The very foundations of Rockstar Games were rocked in 2020 when Dan Houser left. Losing a co-founder was tough, but a source claims that the communication breakdown actually stemmed from a disagreement between Dan and his brother Sam.</p>



<p>Dan Houser has usually shied away from the spotlight over the years. But the Absurd Ventures founder has been more vocal in recent weeks. His sit-down interview with Lex Fridman revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-reveals-real-reason-why-agent-was-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason why Agent was canceled</a>, and he’s also opened up on why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-2-rockstar-development-bandwidth-dan-houser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bully 2 never happened</a>.</p>



<p>A new unofficial line has opened up on his Rockstar Games departure.</p>

<p>If you know anything about GTA leaks, you probably know how reliable and revered Tez2 is in the GTA community. They’ve been a constant source of major GTA and Rockstar leaks for years.</p>







<p>So when the topic of Dan Houser leaving Rockstar Games recently popped up on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/page/6/#comment-1072611067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTAForums</a>, Tez2 stepped in with a claim. One user asked: “We will probably never know exactly the reasons why [Dan Houser left], but I’m not the only one with this opinion, and pretending everything is hunky dory at Rockstar is baffling, especially when we keep hearing bad things coming from people working at a company that is in the middle of a union-busting scandal.”</p>



<p>Here was Tez2’s response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“He left over a disagreement with his brother about the company’s direction, as per two former devs. If it was due to union busting or working conditions, he would have left in 2018 as a way of apologizing for his comment quoted in Schreier’s article.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was in response to the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games firings</a>. Tez2 makes it clear that the two issues are not connected, but again, this isn’t official until this is all confirmed in the books one day.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser’s exit will affect the quality of GTA 6? Should the brothers reunite for at least one more big project in the future?

The Pokémon Cafe's new menu looks set to bring these sweet treats into the real world, but it also might be teasing that a pair of legendary 'mon will make their return in the DLC.</p>
<p>Yep, we live in a world where Pokémon spoilers can come from anywhere, even doughnuts. But come on, take a look at the above two baked goods — currently appearing under the tentative titles of "Red Doughnut" and "Blue Doughnut" on the Pokémon Café's <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/ja/pikachu_sweets/news/251121_3309.html">Pikachu Sweets website</a> — and tell us that you <em>don't</em> see Gen III legendaries Groudon and Kyogre.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ty8h-8gLSNk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytTy8h-8gLSNk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ty8h-8gLSNk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed63b0c7yqsoip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>These two doughnuts will appear in Tokyo's Pikachu Sweets store from 10th December for 550 yen. The accompanying item description teases, "The doughnuts are inspired by the special doughnuts that appear in the paid add-on content, 'Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension'! They look like some kind of Pokémon...?" — huh, you don't say.</p>
<p>A 'Hoopa's Mischief Ruby Chocolate Frappe' will also join the menu on the same date. Its bright pink colouring, cream, and Cheerio topping makes the whole thing look a <em>little</em> too sweet in this writer's opinion, but there's no knocking its dedication to the DLC bit.</p>

<p>You'll be able to start your journey through Hyperspace Luminose when the Legends: Z-A DLC arrives on 10th December for £24.99 / $29.99. We've seen a handful of new Megas coming to the expansion so far, including Raichu, Baxcalibur, Chimecho and Zeraora. The final DLC news drop will come next week on 2nd December, so brace for even more newbies.</p>

			<p>The new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces significant performance improvements on PlayStation 5 Pro by enabling 120 Hz VRR across all of the game's display modes.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">These performance improvements are showcased in a new comparison video shared by&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RajmanGamingHD/videos" target="_blank">RajmanGaming HD,</a>&nbsp;which compares the game running with and without VRR enabled, using all of the game's display modes: Ray Tracing Pro, Balanced Ray Tracing Pro, Ray Tracing, Performance, Balanced, and Quality.</span> The comparison makes it clear how a significant amount of performance is left on the table on the PlayStation 5 Pro with the frame rate capped, as framerates are higher across all display modes with VRR and uncapped framerate.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Display Mode</th><th>VRR OFF / Capped Framerate</th><th>VRR ON / Uncapped Framerate</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing Pro</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>60 FPS (Average)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ray Tracing</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance</strong></td><td>60 FPS</td><td>Up to 95 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced</strong></td><td>40 FPS</td><td>Up to 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quality</strong></td><td>30 FPS</td><td>40 FPS</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Ghost of Yotei also supports 120 Hz VRR on base PlayStation 5 with the new patch, but no performance comparison has been conducted to date, so it's not yet known how much performance was untapped with capped framerates on the system.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-100-patch-is-more-than-just-performance-improvements">1.100 Patch is More Than Just Performance Improvements</h2>



<p>Besides introducing 120 Hz VRR support and the new Balanced display modes, the new Ghost of Yotei 1.100 patch introduces a lot of new features that enhance the experience considerably, such as the ability to auto-loot items, an option to turn off fall damage, new Photo Mode features, a New Game+ mode, replayable endgame content, balance changes, and more.
