  <p id="00PXky"><strong>Legendary Shards</strong> are disappearing in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>. If you’re a veteran player, or have played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> for any significant amount of time, you probably have a pretty big stockpile of Shards that you need to get rid of before June 3, which is when the servers go down to prepare for the new expansion.</p>
<p id="BBut1q">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, I’ll help you figure out what to spend your Legendary Shards on before Bungie deletes them from your inventory.</p>
<hr id="2BLp3I">

<p id="68hK8t">If you’re like me, you have a lot of Legendary Shards to get rid of after seven years of hoarding. If you just wait until June 4, Bungie will delete them all for you, which is convenient. But if you want something more useful after all your time grinding, you can exchange them for a few different items in-game.</p>

<p id="c295Q3">Most players are taking their excess Legendary Shards and using them to purchase <strong>Phantasmal Fragments</strong> at the Lectern of Enchantment on the Moon for 10 Legendary Shards a piece. Rahool, the Cryptarch in the Tower, will allow you to exchange 10 Phantasmal Fragments for 10,000 Glimmer. While Bungie could take this exchange away, it’s better than nothing, and a solid way to turn your Legendary Shards into potential Glimmer.</p>
<p id="fHfMGC">If you’re a raider, another option is to buy<strong> Raid Banners</strong> from Hawthorn in the Tower. You can buy 10 Raid Banners for 30 Legendary Shards.</p>

<p id="MSOmkq">The best Legendary Shard exchange is, unfortunately, completely dependent on RNG. Rarely, Banshee-44 will sell a weapon with a <strong>Masterwork level of five</strong> (you have to buy each weapon to find its masterwork level). If you purchase a Masterwork five weapon over and over again, you’ll get an <strong>Enhancement Core</strong> out of each one that you dismantle. You can also do this if the Masterwork level is four, but the Enhancement Core won’t be guaranteed. </p>
<p id="KfRFOE">Enhancement Cores are very useful for upgrading gear, and getting them is a lot more difficult than restocking your Glimmer. Keep an eye on Banshee’s inventory over the weekend and see if you get lucky.</p>

<strong>What is replacing Legendary Shards in </strong><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong></em><strong>’s economy?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="QMyP4i">Legendary Shards have been the catch-all currency in <em>Destiny 2</em>, alongside <strong>Glimmer</strong>. With Shards going away, Glimmer is going to be the only general currency, and you’re just going to need to pair specialty currencies — like Ascendant Shards — with it to purchase the things you want. </p>
<p id="grYkOx">The catch there is that Glimmer has a cap of 500,000, so you can’t just stockpile it indefinitely like you could Legendary Shards. That’s why having Phantasmal Fragments or old Planetary Materials to exchange for Glimmer is so useful.</p>

What’s most surprising about <em>Selaco</em> isn’t that it’s developed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GZDoom</a></span>, but that it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played in years.<br></p><p><em>Selaco</em>, out now on Steam via early access, is a first-person shooter set inside the last surviving city containing all of human civilization. And unfortunately for the people living there, an alien invasion is happening and it’s up to you—a security guard—to help fight them back and save the day. Unlike <em>Doom </em>and similar shooters of that era, <em>Selaco </em>actually has quite a lot of lore and world-building to dig into via emails and terminals, if that’s something you care about. But if you’re just here to blast baddies with cool guns, <em>Selaco </em>has plenty of that, too.<br></p><h2 id="h11"><a id=""></a><strong>This ain’t your grandaddy’s boomer shooter</strong></h2><p>The gunplay in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/selaco&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/selaco"><em>Selaco</em></a></span><em> </em>is fabulous, with weapons that are loud and powerful. Even the pistol, usually a trash firearm in old-school shooters, is a head-cracking magnum that you can upgrade into a fast-firing death machine. In fact, most of the guns in <em>Selaco </em>can be upgraded to improve their stats or unlock new features. This is done in upgradeable safe rooms you find dotted around the world…and yeah, you might be realizing this isn’t <em>Doom</em>.<br></p><p>That’s something I really want to stress. Don’t expect this to play like <em>Doom </em>or other contemporary shooters of the day. Instead, <em>Selaco</em> plays more like <em>Half-Life, Doom 3, </em>or <em>FEAR.</em> You’ll need to take cover, run away to get a better angle, ambush unsuspecting enemies for an advantage, and manage your ammo and health carefully to survive this FPS. If you go in with a shotgun and no plan, you’ll likely be dead in a few seconds. And as you progress through <em>Selaco </em>it turns up the challenge, forcing you to play carefully or die.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-recommend-id="image://2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a turret shooting an enemy in Selaco.

For the first few hours of <em>Selaco</em>, whenever I saw a massive level filled with individual items that I could pick up and toss around, I’d shake my head and think, “This is built on <em>Doom </em>tech. Wild!” But quickly, the novelty of that gimmick faded and was replaced by another thought: “This is a fucking awesome game.”</p><p><em>Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access!</p><p>In fact, I bet as you play <em>Selaco </em>you’ll quickly forget all about its <em>Doom </em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets. That may be the real secret of <em>Selaco</em>: While it’s cool and impressive that it was built using <em>Doom </em>tech, this<em> </em>is so much more than a retro throwback. It’s its own thing, and one of the best shooters in 2024. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two Interactive appears set to get out of the indie business, and it’s closing studios to get there. According to a damning new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Take-Two Interactive is working on a plan to either sell off or shut down it’s indie label Private Division.</p>



<p>Valentine states that Take-Two, despite saying that it “didn’t shutter” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intercept-games-lay-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s indie studios</a>, Kerbel Space Program developer Intercept Games will be closed on June 28. On a larger scale at Private Division, however, “almost all the staff” were let go at the end of April when it was said to them that Take-Two “would no longer support” the company.</p>



<p>The report adds that Take-Two has found a potential partner to buy Private Division in the form of an unknown private equity firm. </p>



<p>Valentine says that the sources she spoke to “expressed frustration at Take-Two leadership for alleged mismanagement of the label, and called out chief strategy officer and Private Division head Michael Worosz for poor leadership and mismanagement.”</p>



<p>On May 30, it was revealed that Private Division <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/private-division-terminates-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team-for-project-c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had terminated its agreement</a> with Bloober Team to publish Project C. With this new information being brought to light, it makes more sense as to why the agreement was canceled.</p>



<p>It was also in April when Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it was laying off</a> 5% of its global workforce, and canceling numerous games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story. For what it’s worth, the company declined to comment to IGN on the claims brought fourth and the status of Private Division.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-a-violent-nature-review-horror-movie-slasher-villain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dRrzH7"><em>This review of </em>In a Violent Nature <em>was initially published to coincide with the movie’s premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It has been updated for the film’s theatrical release.</em></p>
<h2 id="QtzSlx"><strong>Logline</strong></h2>
<p id="0HWcwP"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> follows Johnny, a hulking creature who has been dead for years, as he seeks vengeance on the most recent group of teens to bring him back to life. </p>
<h2 id="qQJ92i"><strong>Longerline</strong></h2>
<p id="b8GcFu">The way<em> In a Violent Nature</em> reveals its plot is a huge part of the fun of the movie, so no spoilers here. Instead, it’s worth talking a little bit about the vibe of the movie, which is mostly pastoral, rather than bombastic and quick. Writer-director Chris Nash seems to take inspiration from Michael Myers’ slow but deliberate stalking in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333343/best-halloween-movies-series-watch-michael-myers-john-carpenter">the Halloween movie series</a>. Long stretches of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> are still, quiet, gorgeous shots of nature — sometimes with a killer lumbering through them, sometimes not. </p>
<p id="BQQenY">This beautiful photography is a huge bonus to the movie, considering that most of the run time is devoted to Johnny walking from one place to another, in determined pursuit of his victims. Following a slasher-movie villain — part Jason Voorhees, part Michael Myers — mostly means watching him walking around, which seems perfectly intuitive when you see it on screen. <em>In a Violent Nature</em> makes these traveling scenes feel vibrant, purposeful, and intense, rather than like the drag they could have easily been.</p>
<p id="102m6V">Of course, this wouldn’t be a slasher if there wasn’t some slashing, and<em> In a Violent Nature</em> has plenty of that, too. The movie is full of gruesome kills, but Nash mixes the specifics up enough (from beheading to drowning to axe-throwing) that you never quite know what’s coming next, so the action never gets stale. </p>

<h2 id="PdCpiD"><strong>What’s In a Violent Nature trying to do?</strong></h2>
<p id="9bQGiy">It’s hard to describe this movie better than its press release does: It’s been labeled as an “ambient slasher.” It’s a slow, methodical movie, with sparse dialogue and not much character development. But that still doesn’t really describe what <em>In a Violent Nature</em> is going for. It feels more like a nature documentary approach to horror, with a slasher villain as a true animal kingdom predator, stalking through a beautiful forest and watching his prey from the foliage.</p>
<h2 id="5eDPYk"><strong>Does In a Violent Nature live up to its premise? </strong></h2>
<p id="otVa9M">Yes, but it might not be able to quite transcend that premise. <em>In a Violent Nature</em>’s endless forward locomotion and our slasher monster’s unflappable determination keep things interesting, and the tight 94-minute run time makes sure the story isn’t dull. But without the visceral release of tension in jump scares or surprise murder, the film feels like a constant build that never actually fully pays off. There’s no grand ending to cap off the story, which may be fitting for seeing the monster’s side of the story, but isn’t quite satisfying for an audience. Even so, the craft and uniqueness of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> make it well worth a watch.</p>
<h2 id="zX9jQI"><strong>The quote that says it all</strong></h2>
<p id="1HNraQ">This isn’t exactly a single quote, but watching Johnny lurk just outside the light of his teenage victims’ campfire while one of them tells his friends (and the audience) Johnny’s creepy origin story is an outstanding moment that casually reframes nearly every slasher ever made. We all know Jason had to be lurking just past the treeline during various scenes in the Friday the 13th franchise, but what exactly did he overhear while he was stalking his victims? </p>
<h2 id="DcLbG8"><strong>Most memeable moment</strong></h2>
<p id="lhbpmy">It’s hard to imagine finding a meme anywhere in a movie paced this slowly, but Johnny’s cold, dead, monstrous hands clasping around a necklace that says “#1 Motherfucker” is at least pretty funny.</p>
<h2 id="qxrgBT"><strong>Is In a Violent Nature good?</strong></h2>
<p id="oJXGkm"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is good, it’s just good in a different way than you might expect from its premise. It won’t exactly fill the trashy slasher hole in your heart, and it definitely isn’t for the “Friday night at the movies” crowd that most slashers are aimed at.</p>
<p id="bfdODm">But for horror fans, it’s a rare treat and a fantastic exercise in taking a genre in the opposite direction that everyone else has tried.<em> In a Violent Nature</em> may not spawn a franchise of Johnny resurrections, but there’s a good chance that every slasher that comes after it will take small bits of influence from the things<em> In a Violent Nature</em> does well. </p>
<h2 id="LpCOH8"><strong>When can we see it?</strong></h2>
<p id="66w5De"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is in theaters now, and will stream on Shudder later this year. </p>

<p id="oYswHw">Like all tech, the Steam Deck houses many fragile components. But the one that’s most prone to accidental damage is its 7-inch (or 7.4-inch, if you have a Steam Deck OLED) glass-covered display. I highly recommend that every Deck owner buys a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">tempered glass screen protectors</a> (I’ve had nothing but good experiences from amFilm, although there are many players in this space). It may not save your Deck from catastrophic damage, but its job is to absorb scrapes and jabs instead of the actual glass covering your display (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fproducts%2Fsteam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fwhat-to-buy%2F23627961%2Fbest-steam-deck-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">screen replacements</a> aren’t exactly cheap). When the cover eventually gets scratches, or cracks, simply remove it and apply a new one. </p>
<p id="NT7XvN"><strong>Note</strong>: While the Steam Deck OLED’s screen is bigger than the original Steam Deck, the size of the glass covering the display on both models is identical, so these screen protectors are great for whichever Steam Deck you buy.</p>

<p id="Fr7s2k">The Steam Deck comes with up to 512 GB of SSD storage if you buy the $449 LCD model (or the $549 OLED model). Although, for being Valve’s higher-end models, that’s not a abundance of storage, given that PC games routinely come in 30-60 GB install sizes. For those who buy the $349 model, there’s even less onboard storage to work with: just 64 GB. Whichever model you have, buying a microSD card for extra game space is pretty much essential. You might be able to put it off for now, but likely not for long.</p>
<p id="gNUE49">In terms of what’ll work best in your Deck, you can’t go wrong with any 512 GB microSD cards from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7NVXLLM/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7NVXLLM/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026psc=1\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;smid&quot;:&quot;ATVPDKIKX0DER&quot;,&quot;psc&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">SanDisk Ultra</a>, S<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B1HMJ9Z/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">amsung Evo Select</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY512SA-AM/dp/B0CF7QBT92/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2T4P18GWIJ700&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dkUwbNAEdvGpVt0yW8CRZq5fTl5DejNMerOAOoFpSi4QaPlBePGHTFmoZwUdRFIOVIjSzVSftblNhyaKlaKm43CtPEeLG79pjKt2WwSoO--uSoPYWfPIgKQcW3mlkZ7LUL03WRSQv4RQcyGzMuuL7vQTcttzyLwe0tU05u2Orq2Q5_pVwmixWctuMmPVUR-FySEHEcVYR1EL2rVstiCKfoxqHrzEMZTket-p8_C8ZEw.qHhtrWxF5FhkChPpwXyfOp_qCOo0cYw2vonAXIe0Dks&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=samsung%2Bpro%2Bultimate%2Bmicro%2Bsd%2Bcard&amp;qid=1711556995&amp;sprefix=samsung%2Bpro%2Bultimate%2B%2Caps%2C90&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1&amp;tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Ultimate-microSDXC-MB-MY512SA-AM/dp/B0CF7QBT92/ref=sr_1_3?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026crid=2T4P18GWIJ700\u0026dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dkUwbNAEdvGpVt0yW8CRZq5fTl5DejNMerOAOoFpSi4QaPlBePGHTFmoZwUdRFIOVIjSzVSftblNhyaKlaKm43CtPEeLG79pjKt2WwSoO--uSoPYWfPIgKQcW3mlkZ7LUL03WRSQv4RQcyGzMuuL7vQTcttzyLwe0tU05u2Orq2Q5_pVwmixWctuMmPVUR-FySEHEcVYR1EL2rVstiCKfoxqHrzEMZTket-p8_C8ZEw.qHhtrWxF5FhkChPpwXyfOp_qCOo0cYw2vonAXIe0Dks\u0026dib_tag=se\u0026keywords=samsung+pro+ultimate+micro+sd+card\u0026qid=1711556995\u0026sprefix=samsung+pro+ultimate+,aps,90\u0026sr=8-3\u0026th=1\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;crid&quot;:&quot;2T4P18GWIJ700&quot;,&quot;dib&quot;:&quot;eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dkUwbNAEdvGpVt0yW8CRZq5fTl5DejNMerOAOoFpSi4QaPlBePGHTFmoZwUdRFIOVIjSzVSftblNhyaKlaKm43CtPEeLG79pjKt2WwSoO--uSoPYWfPIgKQcW3mlkZ7LUL03WRSQv4RQcyGzMuuL7vQTcttzyLwe0tU05u2Orq2Q5_pVwmixWctuMmPVUR-FySEHEcVYR1EL2rVstiCKfoxqHrzEMZTket-p8_C8ZEw.qHhtrWxF5FhkChPpwXyfOp_qCOo0cYw2vonAXIe0Dks&quot;,&quot;dib_tag&quot;:&quot;se&quot;,&quot;keywords&quot;:&quot;samsung+pro+ultimate+micro+sd+card&quot;,&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;1711556995&quot;,&quot;sprefix&quot;:&quot;samsung+pro+ultimate+,aps,90&quot;,&quot;sr&quot;:&quot;8-3&quot;,&quot;th&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Samsung Pro Ultimate</a> lineups (these are advertised with different read/write speeds, but perform similarly in the Deck).</p>

<p id="0JALoS">Many people jibe with the feel of Valve’s thumbsticks on the Steam Deck. But if you dislike how slippery they can be, simply pop some of these affordable grips from Skull &amp; Co. on top of your Deck’s sticks. For <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skull-Co-Convex-Thumb-Grips/dp/B0CFF3SX1N/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Skull-Co-Convex-Thumb-Grips/dp/B0CFF3SX1N/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">$6.99</a>, you’ll get two pairs of thumb pads in the color of your choice that lengthen the height of your sticks, add some roundness to them, not to mention add grip. Keep in mind, however, that they may prevent the Deck’s capacitive thumbstick feature from working as intended.</p>

<p id="I9MB8A">We don’t recommend this route for most people, but if you’re willing to open up your Steam Deck to add even faster storage than microSD (at your own risk), Corsair’s MP600 Mini 1 TB M.2 SSD is a relatively inexpensive option.

<p id="JvVdpZ">If you envision going into the Steam Deck’s desktop mode, you may want to grab a compact wireless keyboard to type on. Without it, it’s a real pain to touch type and navigate on the Deck’s screen (especially if you have big fingers). So, do yourself a favor and buy this all-in-one, foldable keyboard that has a trackpad built in. If that’s a bit pricey and you don’t particularly care whether the keyboard folds, you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Touchpad-PC-connected/dp/B014EUQOGK/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Touchpad-PC-connected/dp/B014EUQOGK/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Logitech’s reliable K400 Plus wireless</a> model that has a trackpad built-in for about $25.</p>

<p id="mJOxOy">While Valve wasn’t the first company to launch a Deck-compatible dock, its version is one of the most port-rich options. Its Deck Dock has HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-C port to receive power from a wall adapter (it includes the same 45 W model that the Steam Deck ships with), a gigabit Ethernet port, and three USB-A 3.1 ports. The inclusion of DisplayPort sets it apart from most USB-C hubs, along with its elegant design. But it comes at a pricier cost than most third-party alternatives, priced at <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock">$79</a>.</p>

<p id="NVUl4f">Jsaux makes a very similar option to Valve’s official Deck Dock, albeit with a less catchy name. It’s called the HB0702, and it costs $59.99. Like the Deck Dock, it has USB-C for power, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, three USB-A 3.2 ports, and gigabit Ethernet support. Get this one if you don’t care whether you have the official Deck Dock, but want nearly identical features.</p>

It includes more than you may need, like a kickstand (shown above), accessory mounts, and more. But crucially, it includes screws that don’t come in the a-la-carte wall or monitor mounting bundles.

<p id="KmEfId">The wall mount is self-explanatory; it’s a mount that you can secure to your wall by two screws, or just by its strong 3M VHB adhesive. Then the Deckmate’s grip lets it snap onto the wall. As for the monitor mount, you’re getting a mount that can be screwed into any VESA-compliant stand. Then you just snap the Deck onto it.</p>
<p id="VNzT5f">Mechanism recently added a phone mount to the Deckmate’s skill set.

<p id="bKk6So">If you want a controller to use with your Steam Deck, whether it’s docked or on a stand, you have multiple options. The Deck supports most controllers that connect Bluetooth or via USB. This includes controllers you may already have laying around if you own consoles, like those that control the Xbox Series X, PS5, or Nintendo Switch, and more. </p>
<p id="HKhwaa">You should proceed to the next section if you’re happy with the controllers you own. But, if you’re in the market for a unique gamepad that has the Xbox analog stick layout, Hall effect joysticks that won’t degrade over time compared to standard analog sticks, plus native wireless support with the Nintendo Switch, your best bet is the 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless.</p>

<p id="qholSr">Baseus’ 24,000 mAh battery has a 140 W USB-C output speed, which is ridiculously overpowered for the Steam Deck’s needs.

<p id="qd7Aib">There are a bunch of soft and hard cases out there that you can slip your Steam Deck into to ruggedize it, and any of those might be just fine for you. But we’ve really enjoyed the Dbrand Project Killswitch, which lets you add or remove a kickstand, in addition to doing a great job of protecting your console and adding some grip.</p>
<p id="8RoiZb">Like most options, the Killswitch leaves easy access to all of its buttons, triggers, ports, and most importantly, its fan’s airflow. But it’s great that you can add or remove the included kickstand with its lock slot.

<p id="R7Ufbz">It’s a shame that Valve doesn’t offer its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23950949/steam-deck-oled-new-case-review-valve">improved case</a> bundled exclusively with the Steam Deck OLED 1 TB edition for general sale. It gives you the option of a thick, tough case Deck owners are used to, but its special trick lies in its ability to transform into a slimmer case when you pull away its Velcro-locked inner layer. Until that becomes widely available, anyone who’s looking for a case replacement should check out Spigen’s Rugged Armor Pro, a semi-hard case with a pocket. Additionally, it secures the Deck inside with a strap, and if you’re worried about losing your console, there’s enough room in its pocket for a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23707943/best-bluetooth-tracker-item-finder-apple-airtag-tile">Bluetooth tracker</a>, like an Apple AirTag. This models seems to be out of stock currently, so we’re investigating replacement options.</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A few years back, someone spread the word that FromSoftware was making a Kart game set in the world of <em>Bloodborne</em>. It was but an April Fools’ joke, but it soon blossomed into much more.</p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Over two years of development and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/">few months of legal tinkering</a> later, developer Lilith Walther has finally released <em>Nightmare Kart</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Nightmare Kart:🏁OUT NOW FOR FREE🏁</p><p>🏎️Zoom through gothic city streets in this combat kart racer!</p><p>💉Full campaign mode complete w boss fights!<br>🕵️21 Racers!<br>🏍️13 Karts!<br>🏁15 Tracks!<br>⚔️Split Screen Multiplayer!</p><p>🩸LETS CLEANSE THESE FOUL STREETS🩸</p><p>⬇️DOWNLOAD LINKS IN REPLIES⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/fbScnmrhFG">pic.twitter.com/fbScnmrhFG</a></p></div>— 🪄✨ PSX Bunlith (NIGHTMARE KART OUT NOW!!!) (@b0tster) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0tster/status/1796557254281638255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">You might know Lilith from <em><a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/bbpsx">Bloodborne PSX</a></em>, a remake of the first sections of the PS4 classic that played and looked just like a PS1 game. It was great, but <em>Nightmare Kart</em> is on a whole different level. You can pick between 21 racers, 13 karts, 15 tracks, and none of it is a mere transplant from <em>Bloodborne</em>. While each character is heavily inspired by a <em>Bloodborne</em> counterpart, these are all complemented by original additions coming straight out of Lilith’s mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Most vehicles are original and unique, some of them to the point of absurdity. For example, Herman doesn’t even need a Kart or a Bike. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-bloodborne-mandatory-boss-fights-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old man remains so strong</a> that he needs nothing more than his his ultra-powerful arms to move his wheelchair as quickly as everyone else moves their motorized vehicle. Nicolas is mad, but no one even dares coming close enough to tell him about the rules, so he ditches any sort of vehicle and just runs alongside the others. Those are just a few of the quirks I’ve been able to notice in the short period of time I’ve had to try the game so far, so I’m sure there are so many more for you to find.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">On top of allowing you to challenge your friends to races in split-screen mode, there’s also a battle mode where you can just duke it out against a bunch of friends or AI opponents in a bunch of very familiar arenas. <em>Nightmare Kart</em> not only looks like a game of old, it also features many of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer options</a> that we miss in the games of today.</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">There are also a bunch of very welcome customization options, such as the CRT FX, which does a great job of filtering the pixelation like the TVs of old did. Also, this might be the closest non-modders will ever get to playing something <em>Bloodborne</em>-ish at 60 FPS:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The most positively surprising element for me, however, was the presence of an actual campaign, one with cutscenes and even unique boss fights.</p>

<p data-characters="351" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been struggling to determine how, exactly, I want to talk about <em>Centum</em>. Not in terms of basic stuff, like genre or developer or “it plays like X meets Y.” Those are fairly easy to tack down. No, it’s the next layer down that has had me thinking a lot about <em>Centum </em>since I hit the end of its preview build: the how and why.</p> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">So let’s start with the easy parts. <em>Centum </em>is a narrative adventure, largely falling within the point-and-click genre, from developer Hack The Publisher and publisher Serenity Forge. Most of its gameplay consists of interacting with objects, selecting dialogue choices, and unlocking new interactions through flowchart-like experimentation. Move an object, find a new thing to put in your inventory, test it out on all the other interactable spots on-screen. If you’ve ever journeyed with Guybrush Threepwood or Putt-Putt, these parts will feel familiar.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Where it starts to feel less familiar is all the mini-games. Or the sudden art style switches. Or maybe even with the creepy ghost kid who seems helpful, for now. This is where <em>Centum </em>starts to make it clear that it’s not just another adventure game.</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Centum Official Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aR86sG-uKc4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Even before you’re in the swing of pointing and clicking, <em>Centum </em>starts you out in a computer interface. It’s an old-school, chunky interface that reminded me of the colorful iMacs we used to use in school. I will never be able to resist a good fake desktop; poring over files and folders is a guilty pleasure, and much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-telling-lies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telling Lies</a> </em>or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cibele-is-a-game-about-love-sex-and-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cibele</a></em>,<em> Centum </em>leans into that. Although rather than deriving some gratification from digging through personal details, it builds a lot of terror over discovering what exactly a file or folder might contain.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Let me put it a different way: <em>Centum </em>imagines that you are interacting with this computer. But what does it mean that <em>you</em>, the player, are interacting with it? What is this computer, exactly? Where, when, and why does it exist? And what happened to the people that used this interface before? </p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">As you read over notepad clues and hints towards your situation, it becomes a little creepier. Names start to drop, and you only have vague understandings of their importance. Also, can a machine be haunted? This one sure feels haunted. If ghosts could plague the living, what spirits can manifest in the binary ones-and-zeroes of <em>Centum</em>‘s PC?</p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">These are the thoughts I had running through my mind as I clicked and prodded my way through <em>Centum</em>‘s first two chapters. Both are closed-room puzzles, where the player needs to discern a way out, while also running up against several different roadblocks. In the first chapter, for instance, you’re trapped in a cell. A Judge berates you, asking why you’re here, what you did, and who you are. It reprimands you when you answer incorrectly, and I was always wrong.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Again, these moments feel a bit familiar: a locked room, filled with philosophical and psychological quandaries surrounding how you’ll get out. Hack The Publisher even has a little minigame that’s similar to the Giant’s Game from <em>Ender’s Game</em>, eye-gouging and all, that feels like a little nod towards players that notice the similarities.</p> <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="1029" data-injectable="true">The ways to get out are similarly gnarly and surreal. I talked to a wall, grew a tree, and observed the city. A small box played music. And at one point, I trapped a demon with mirrors. I don’t want to get too deep into the “how” of it all, as that’s a big appeal of <em>Centum</em>‘s in-the-moment puzzle-solving, though I also think it’s where <em>Centum </em>struggled a bit for me. Some solutions, like the aforementioned mirrors, felt a bit unclear at times. And you’ll need a good tolerance for picking up objects and testing them on various other items; some were a bit straightforward to figure out, while others were head-scratchers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The mini-games are also a little hit-or-miss. I enjoyed them in a few cases, and there’s an element of simplicity and tedium that feels textually important. It did mean, though, that when I accidentally restarted one of the games, being locked back into beating it was a bit frustrating. Not a major gripe, just a small wrinkle.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">What really, <em>really </em>works for <em>Centum </em>is its art style. Really, it’s a multitude of art styles. At some points, it looks like a point-and-click classic. Then, it will introduce a creepy apparition. Then, it might peel off into a seemingly hand-drawn, winding line art of white-on-black. These segues can feel sudden and jarring in a really good way. And man, the cat-phone. I am haunted by the cat-phone.</p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">By the end of the preview, I felt I was starting to grasp what <em>Centum </em>is about, and the story it’s trying to tell. It’s an incredibly fascinating one. I think if you like the general gist of exploring artificial intelligence, man-made horrors, and maybe a heaping helping of both guilt and family drama, you’ll dig what <em>Centum </em>is concocting.</p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Really, <em>Centum </em>feels like a reminder of what this year is turning out to be. The usual wave of AAA releases has slowed to a trickle, and indie studios are finding a lot of room to appeal to niche interests, to eschew broad appeals in favor of making something a bit more unique. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">That is <em>Centum</em>, to me. It might not be for <em>everyone</em>. But the fact that it isn’t makes it all the more appealing to me. I dig its thoughts about ghosts in the machine. I vibe with its art style. Maybe I do like cat-phone, after all. But I do think, if any of this made you sit up a bit in your seat and go “hm,” then <em>Centum </em>is worth keeping an eye on.</p>
 <p data-characters="76" data-current-count="76" data-injectable="false"><em>Centum </em>is currently planned for Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this summer.</p>

The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios">recently revived</a> board game has received new updates and expansions before, including the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroquest-rise-of-dread-moon-breathes-new-life-into-30-year-old-game"><em>Rise of the Dread Moon</em></a>. This new expansion, HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak continues that active support.</p>

<h2>The HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak Pre-order announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> brings players into the dense jungle surrounding the mountains at World's Edge. In this jungle, an ancient dwarven civilization has found new roots. But a sacred artifact held in Kellar's Keep, prized by the dwarven refugees, has been stolen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=Y59qGFPc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=vtPIYMmw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to jump back in?</figcaption></figure><p>Because of this, a blight has infected the jungle to its roots. As a powerful Berserker or Explorer hero, players will traverse the jungles and discover the vile secrets within. But all may be lost if the truth behind this land and its past are not uncovered.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> expansion will contain 16 new quests. Those quests will include a new choose-your-own-adventure mechanic where players can choose different paths leading to different endings. While other co-op board games have branching narratives based on player choice, this is a first for <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<p>The expansion contains 36 illustrated cards, 29 detailed unpainted miniatures, and 29 double-sided cardboard pieces.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> is the second major quest pack to release for this new era of the board game. After being discontinued in 2010 and a brief fan reprint in 2021, the <em>HeroQuest</em> line was brought back to retail thanks to a licensing deal with Hasbro. That licensing deal included the production of new expansions as well as organized play support.</p>

<p>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak will be available for pre-order August 1 on Amazon and fan retailers. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99. You will need a copy of the HeroQuest main game to use this new expansion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-a-frenetic-wild-ride.886770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With a name like <em>Anger Foot</em>, that's a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. This is one wacky game all about kicking baddies through the mean streets of Shit City. You're on a quest to steal back your beloved shoe collection, and you'll stop at nothing to get those precious kickers back.</p>

<p>It's really hard not to be goofy about <em>Anger Foot</em>, because the premise is so fun, even if it's a bit simplistic. After all, you're just kicking your way through droves of goons, and maybe you'll pick up a few guns along the way. There's definitely a game underneath all this goofiness, though, and it seems to have improved since my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foot-is-hotline-miami-for-foot-fetishists">last foray</a> into the madness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=klFVGiR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=otXDKfvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crime is law, and law is crime!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Mean Streets of <em>Anger Foot'</em>s... WHAT City?</h2>

<p>Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/free-lives">Free Lives</a>' efforts have not gone unnoticed in polishing up this title. If you managed to play <em>Anger Foot </em>at PAX or during a Steam Next Fest, you'll know there was a solid foundation for a game. In this new build, however, the look of <em>Anger Foot</em> has improved a great deal, level designs are expanded, and it also adds new (and outrageously weird) story segments.</p>

<p>In terms of graphics, the lighting Free Lives added to <em>Anger Foot</em> did wonders to the overall aesthetic of the game. You're in this dank, dirty city full of violence and chaos, so it's fitting that the game takes a bit of a darker look. The shaders don't clash with the brighter, cartoonish style and create a very playful aesthetic.</p>

<p>Levels, on the other hand, appear more detailed with clutter and objects that go flying when you unleash your hellish kick on enemies. Enemies, trash, beer bottles, barrels, and doors go flying at every kick and makes for some chaotic and lighthearted action.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=JYFNeiQ- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=EOvy3e09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kid's Mom won't be happy when she hears he's been watching TELEVISION!</figcaption></figure><p>Level layouts I remember from my previous sessions with <em>Anger Foot</em> seem a bit longer and more intricate. There are more side paths or rooms added this time around, giving off the feeling of a more finished product.</p>

<p>As for the world itself, we see it get fleshed out in more story segments -- these occur every few levels. Our hellbent hero can walk through the streets and apartments and interact with Shit City's various denizens -- and no, I'm not making that name up. It's really called Shit City.</p>

<p>The crude humor of <em>Anger Foot</em> isn't going to appeal to everyone, but it can be quite comical at times. Crime is normal in Shit City, you see, so laws are non-existent. This flips society on its head, and instead of being shamed for littering, you have whole gangs dedicated to polluting the city.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=ysNEyEIS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=RD359WPU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure this is totally safe and sanitary.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other groups, too, like the Violence Gang, lead by Goo Cop. At one point during a story segment, I learned that initiation into the Violence Gang required one to be shanked. But you know, that's one of the more <em>normal</em> interactions amongst this city's people.</p>

<p>Heck, have you ever seen a masked-up thug hold a dolphin at gunpoint? Man, in Shit City, instead of ridding the city's water source of microplastics, we have hooligans making <em>macroplastics</em>. There are some real out-of-pocket moments that'll likely get a chuckle or two out of you, and honestly, I can't wait to learn more about the other gangs in <em>Anger Foot</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=7gZWkiAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AXUriARo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if he skipped leg day?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Anger Foot -- </em>it's Faster, Better, and Harder</h2>

<p>If you aren't weird like me, then you'll probably care more about the gameplay than whatever the hell is going on in Shit City. Fair, and you may be happy to know you can skip story segments if you so choose. If you're here for gameplay, <em>Anger Foot</em> retains that same <em>Hotline Miami-</em>inspired, balls-to-the-wall, one-hit-kill philosophy.</p>

<p>You've got a foot that can kick, and a hand that can hold guns. You can kick bad guys and take their guns, shoot when you need to, and kick when all else fails. Knocking down doors as fast as you can while rushing to the finish is the name of the game.</p>

<p>I like the gameplay, for the most part. It's simple, but with the physics and chaos at every level (as well as some better level design), we have a fast-paced, solid experience. The difficulty this time around feels a bit more punishing than last time, which is a shame since<em> </em>my last sessions with<em> </em><em>Anger Foot</em> felt juuust right.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=8GCH6cYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-shotgun.jpg?itok=xugMDyLZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's not just gangsters you'll be fighting.</figcaption></figure><p>The one-hit kill mechanic mentioned, as in you can kill enemies in one hit and they can do the same to you, mostly applies here, although in some instances I was able to survive a bullet or blow from a bad guy. Gameplay is timed and with challenges for every level, you're incentivized to get to the exit as fast as possible. This is where the gameplay felt at odds with itself.</p>

<p>Because you're incentivized to go fast, you want to rush through levels. Enemies, however, are often placed in blind spots or have aim rivaling that of a Navy SEAL sniper, meaning you're going to die a lot. Oftentimes, it just feels unfair. If you don't beeline for the thugs with the guns right away, you're going to restart almost immediately.</p>

<p>The aim felt just a little <em>too</em> good on these guys, so you can avoid shots by hiding behind a wall or going slower -- but why <em>would</em> you want to go slower when <em>Anger Foot</em> urges the player to rush? The difficulty just felt off, and that feeling of rushing was exacerbated by challenges that seemed impossible to complete with how many thugs with guns you'd happen across.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=AkPMeWkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay.jpg?itok=i20A1KqL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When all else fails, use guns.</figcaption></figure><p>After making my way through, by my estimation around 40 percent of <em>Anger Foot</em>, it's evident there's been a lot of fine-tuning. I love the <a>outrageous</a>, silly world Free Lives is developing and its universe has the potential to expand across multiple games. I have no doubt the rest of <em>Anger Foot</em> is equally stellar, but the current difficulty might just be a little too much for me.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-football-25%E2%80%99s-unique-features-make-it-look-like-way-more-than-a-madden-reskin.886767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7XzBDG">Summer is only just starting, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis">college football fans are already itching to head back to campus</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a>. The upcoming game marks the franchise’s return after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports">over 10 years of absence</a>, and will be the first game in the series to feature officially licensed player likenesses, thanks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5525588/2024/05/29/ea-sports-college-football-25-video-games-nil/">NIL money and a large-scale campaign to pay players to appear in the game</a>. On Friday, EA released a massive deep-dive into the game’s ridiculous number of new features, and the ways it aims to create the most realistic college football experience ever, both on and off the field. </p>
<p id="9rL168">With real players in the game for the first time, many of <em>College Football 25</em>’s new features put an emphasis on making it clear what separates the best players in the sport from everyone else. The game includes a variety of players traits that will augment gameplay, like responding better to high pressure situations and being able to identify on-coming blitzers. There will be more than 80 of these traits in the game at launch, as well as different tiers for each one. </p>
<p id="WtcgpY">The game will also feature an extensive new injury system called Wear and Tear, which shows the specific injury effects of each play, and how much it increases a player’s risk of injury. While this is important during games, it’s even more important in modes like Dynasty, where you run an entire college football program and have to look after your players from game to game. </p>
<div id="5C5ugz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WRwJy2">One of the ways the game appears to be a major departure from the Madden franchise is also true of college football versus the NFL: There’s way more variety in playbooks. <em>College Football 25</em> already seems pretty dedicated to preserving the individuality and quirks of the 134 schools in the game. There’s a detailed option system in the game, including a Flexbone formation with Air Force’s signature triple option. There’s a new feature which lets players pull the ball back and run with it in the middle of a called reverse, and EA even highlights a wide formation, a staple for Oklahoma. </p>
<p id="Bm9dk7">EA also takes time to note how important real-life tradition is to the presentation of games in <em>College Football 25</em>. Every stadium and fan base in college football has their own unique rituals, and EA has tried to capture as many of those as they can for the game, licensing certain songs for team walkout music (<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/ea-college-football-25-enter-sandman-jump-around-iconic-songs/73f0857036908ba007de66e9">though not every song could be secured</a>), and including fan traditions like Tennessee’s checkered stadium and Penn State’s “White Out”. All of this is in service of not just recreating the authentic highs of a college home game, but also to enhance the game’s new emphasis on home field advantage, with the ridiculously loud stadiums making it harder for the away team to concentrate on things like calling hot routes.</p>
<p id="qcPNwf">These are just a few of the new features EA Sports announced for the game on Friday. To get a look at more of the features, EA has put together a short gameplay video narrated by sportscaster Kirk Herbstreit, as well as a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">very in-depth blog post</a> that outlines each of the game’s new systems in great detail. </p>
<p id="WDcFqN"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> is set for release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.</p>

You instead decided to mix 2D <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s with perspective-shifting 3D environments. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Tokuro Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> runs on 3D technology, with gameplay designed around 2D principles. This is why it’s described as a 2.5D game. I think 2D games have a certain kind of charm that 3D doesn’t. I also wanted to push the limits of what could be done. To bring my vision to life, I needed to use 2D principles along with 3D CG visuals. This allowed me to create something that felt new on the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,137 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>.</p><p>“There were times when I wondered if I should go 3D instead, 3D games have a very clear sense of space. In 2D, all the <a title="Genres > Action [1,867 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> takes place on a flat plane, and multiple layers provide a sense of depth. This means you have to design the game in creative ways so that the different layers don’t conflict. This results in something interesting that can only be achieved with 2D.”</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-886605-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>What do you hope new players will take away from <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> has many side quests. These come in different varieties and are hidden throughout the game. I encourage players to seek them out. Various items allow players to learn new moves, expanding how levels can be beaten. I hope players search and seal away the Evil Pigs scattered throughout the world, which will unlock even more to see! There are many discoveries to be made. I hope players can relax and enjoy the world of <em>Tomba!</em>”</p><p><video id="video-886605-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Speaking of genre-bending gameplay. <em>Tomba!</em> feels like an open world despite being described as a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [662 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a title="Genres > Platformer [444 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>. This was largely due to how nonlinearly the levels could be played. Was this done intentionally, or was it something that just happened through development?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “I had envisioned this open-feel game from the very beginning. It was all a blur when things started, but as development progressed, it began taking shape.</p><p>“You could consider <em>Tomba!</em> an open-world title, a term that was rarely used back then. There’s a wide area with a lot of different content in it. You encounter, discover, and collect various things as you move around. For example, you have to complete certain tasks in <em>Tomba!</em>, but you can wander around freely and complete them however you like. Some tasks and main objectives can even be skipped entirely. Many of the ideas I envisioned for <em>Tomba!</em> back in the day were ideas we see in <a title="Genres > Open-World [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> design today.</p><p>“I initially wanted to include 100 quests, but the final game exceeded that. It was hard work for the team to fit it all together on a timeline. What started out as vague ideas in my head ballooned into an amount of content so large it blew my mind!”</p><p><video id="video-886605-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>The original PlayStation was a massive leap in gaming technology. What was it like to experience it back then?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “Game development is an ongoing battle against technology growth. This was the case back then and is still true today. I felt that the PlayStation was such a remarkable improvement in terms of hardware, allowing for greater possibilities. Games went from being rendered in pixels to CG. Game developers had to learn many new skills. Expectations ballooned along with the scope of game ideas. Development environments evolved, which made things challenging but exciting for developers. The introduction of the PlayStation and the advancements from that era still impact games today.”</p><p><video id="video-886605-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Finally, why do you think it’s important to bring <em>Tomba!</em> back now?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> has been around for a long time, but continues to be loved by many. I’ve long wished that the game could be accessible to more people on modern systems. Now that the opportunity is here, I think PlayStation fans today will get a ton of enjoyment out of <em>Tomba!</em>“</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">College football’s best quarterbacks stay calm, cool, and collected in the pocket. But that’s always easier said than done when you have over 100,000 fans at Beaver Stadium or in Death Valley cheering so loud you can’t even hear yourself think. Here is everything you need to know about confidence and composure in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. </p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Abilities in <em>College Football 25</em> help players differentiate themselves from the rest of the competition and provide boosts that could be the difference in winning a game. However, confidence and composure are two other skills that every college athlete needs to perform at the highest level, and EA created a feature that replicates that. </p>  <figure data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="College Football 25 | Gameplay Deep Dive" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">As explained in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf86x8F9M90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive trailer</a>, confidence and composure are constantly changing features that depend on players getting hot or cold depending on the outcome of each play. For example, a freshman will have more erratic tendencies, and as the crowd level increases, it will affect their confidence.&nbsp;Events such as scoring touchdowns can lift the morale of your entire team, while individual achievements such as a pass breakup can significantly boost the composure of the player who made the big play.</p>
 <p data-characters="624" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Composure goes hand-in-hand with individual player archetypes. In the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">gameplay deep</a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">dive blog</a>, EA used an example of a scrambling quarterback who gets hot will have improved ball security, while a field general will benefit from improved throw accuracy. There are also mental abilities that will impact composure. The Legion ability increased the confidence of other defensive backs when that player gets an interception, but these mental abilities are also lost whenever a player goes cold. Coaches will have to manage their players based on how cold or hot they are and how experienced they are given a certain situation. </p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">If the home crowd is getting louder, it might be smart to do a simpler play so the player doesn’t make a mistake because of their confidence and composure. </p>

As you might have guessed from the name, it’s giving serious Tatsuki Fujimoto Before Chainsaw Man vibes and will surely give a look inside the creations of Endo before the release of the popular <em>Spy x Family</em> manga. </p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcement: Journey back to the 2000’s with this stand-alone collection of dark and gritty one shots from Spy x Family creator, Tatsuya Endo.

If you’ve not seen it, it may be hard to picture Endo getting overly dark and gritty, but if you’ve seen <em>TISTA</em>, you know it’s certainly in his wheelhouse.</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false"><em>Four Lives Remain: Tatsuya Endo Before Spy x Family </em>will be released in Spring 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is a game designed to create the illusion that you’ve entered another world. Epic fantasy novels heavily inspired the creators of <em>D&amp;D,</em> and the tabletop role-playing game’s connection to fantasy literature has only grown stronger with age.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Both the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> and the <em>Dungeon Masters Guide</em> encourage players and DMs to hit their local library before they get to work<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build/"> designing their next character</a> or crafting their party’s next adventure. I’ve been playing <em>D&amp;D</em> on both sides of the DM screen for years, and I can safely confirm that the ten standalone books and series listed below helped me create some of my favorite characters and campaigns.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-dresden-files-by-jim-butcher" data-injectable="false">10. The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lionsgate</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">Some of the best <em>D&amp;D</em> campaigns I’ve been in revolved around solving mind-bending mysteries with a magical twist. If your latest campaign is a noir-influenced fantasy whodunnit that’s piqued your interest in the mystery genre, you should check out <em>The Dresden Files</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Jim Butcher’s long-running urban fantasy series follows the adventures of the titular sorcerous detective, who dedicates his eternally imperiled life to solving outlandish capers tied to Chicago’s hidden magical underworld. If you’re in the market for some exciting noir tales that happen to feature the odd vampire or demon, <em>The Dresden Files</em> is for you.</p> <h3 id="h-9-the-cthulhu-mythos-by-h-p-lovecraft-and-august-derluth" data-injectable="false">9. The Cthulhu Mythos by H.P. Lovecraft and August Derluth</h3> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via TheCollector</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">Many of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most iconic monsters, including the multi-eyed, beam-spewing Beholder, are beings from the Far Realm, a plane of pure cosmic chaos where the line between reality and illusion becomes illegible. I’ve been in more than a few D&amp;D games where the Far Realm’s innate insanity slithered its way into the mix, and this refreshing dose of existential dread wouldn’t t have been possible without the<em> Cthulu Mythos</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">H.P. Lovecraft’s tales about a pantheon of incomprehensible extraterrestrial gods lurking in the shadows of the universe pioneered the cosmic horror genre, and <em>D&amp;D</em> players are looking to add a bit of eldritch spice to their latest character or campaign will find plenty of inspiration in them. Be warned: Lovecraft was, to put it bluntly, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21363945/hp-lovecraft-racism-examples-explained-what-is-lovecraftian-weird-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racist</a>, and his uncensored work <em>will</em> make most readers uncomfortable.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-the-lord-of-the-rings-by-j-r-tolkien" data-injectable="false">8. The Lord of the Rings by J.R. Tolkien</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">It would be heresy not to put <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>on this list. J.R.R. Tolkien’s famous literary cycle was <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s biggest inspiration, to the point where <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/blog/cease-and-desist-dont-mess-with-tolkien/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were legal disputes</a> surrounding the early usage of terms like orc, elf, dwarf, and dragon.</p>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Some D&amp;D fans might be surprised to see <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> ranked so low. I’d still recommend Tolkien’s iconic trilogy to any <em>D&amp;D</em> player who hasn’t read them, especially if they started playing a campaign set within the Forgotten Realms. However, <em>D&amp;D</em> grew out of Middle Earth’s shadow long ago, and saying that <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is “the” series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans feels a bit regressive, especially since many modern <em>D&amp;D</em> settings go out of their way to buck the tropes Tolkien established.</p>
 <h3 id="h-7-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-by-steven-erikson" data-injectable="false">7. Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Tor Books</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">One of the best parts of a <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign is building the world where the story will play out, especially if the group’s DM is willing to let the other players in on the world-building process. If you and anyone else at your table are kicking around the idea of starting a new campaign set at a much later or earlier point in your world’s history, <em>Malazan Book of the Fallen</em> will give you some great ideas.</p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">The <em>Malazan</em> series is a masterclass in fantasy world-building that follows the rise of the titular empire over millennia. With a cast consisting of immortal mages and dynasties with lineages stretching back centuries, <em>Malazan</em> is perfect for players and DMs who want to explore how the passage of time can change a character, a civilization, or even a world’s innate magic.</p> <h3 id="h-6-mistborn-by-brandon-sanderson" data-injectable="false">6. Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson</h3> <figure data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Dicebreaker</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">Any experienced <em>D&amp;D</em> can attest that the Rogue is one of the funniest classes to play. Plenty of fantasy novels star nimble-fingered sneaks who prefer to creep through the shadows while the warriors and the mages hog the spotlight, but few will feel more familiar to <em>D&amp;D </em>players than <em>Mistborn</em>.</p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Brandon Sanderson’s seminal fantasy series unfolds in the world of Scadriel, where ash never stops falling from the sky, an oppressive empire rules most of the world, and the only hope of defeating the fallen hero of prophecy lies in a young thief named Vin. Vin is essentially an Arcane Trickster Rogue, and her quest to overthrow the Final Empire with magic and subterfuge is full of fun twists on established fantasy tropes that will leave <em>D&amp;D</em> fans in awe.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-book-of-the-new-sun-by-gene-wolf" data-injectable="false">5. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolf</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon &amp; Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">One of <em>D&amp;D</em>‘s most “peculiar” settings is <em>Dark Sun</em>, a grim realm where magic is inherently toxic and a gang of vicious Sorcerer Kings rule everything under the red, dying sun. <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/dark-sun-problematic">Due to some problematic elements of its world-building</a>, <em>Dark Sun</em> has not received an official setting book for a while, but anyone who enjoys it will find a suitable substitute in <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">Set on a far-future version of Earth where society has regressed to feudalism, <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> is a haunting parable that follows a disgraced torturer’s transformation into a messianic figure who holds the key to the world’s future. Visions of the future and mysterious magics abound in this series, and anyone who’s experienced the world of <em>Dark Sun</em> will feel right at home reading this.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-by-george-r-r-martin" data-injectable="false">4. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Biblioctopus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">I’m one of those <em>D&amp;D</em> players who love to lose themselves in their character, and I’ll always prefer a campaign that gives me the complex challenge of navigating interpersonal relationships over ones that focus on dungeon-crawling or combat. If you’re also one of those players, I can’t think of a fantasy series you’ll like more than <em>A Song of Ice and Fir</em>e.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">George R.R. Martin’s iconic world runs on dynastic politics, not magic or prophecies, and its dedication to subverting and reimagining established fantasy tropes means that none of the characters you come to care about are safe. Any fan of <em>D&amp;D</em> and other character-driven TTRPGs will love <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>.</p> <h3 id="h-3-wings-of-fire-by-tui-t-sutherland" data-injectable="false">3. Wings of Fire by Tui. T Sutherland</h3> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">If the title didn’t tip you off, dragons are an important part of <em>D&amp;D</em>, and there are a wide variety of them across the game’s many supplements and setting books. Some of my favorite (and most traumatic) <em>D&amp;D</em> memories are tied to dragons, and the only fantasy book that comes close to challenging D&amp;D’s draconic diversity is Tui T. Sutherland’s <em>Wings of Fire</em> series.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">The world of <em>Wings of Fire</em> has a dragon for almost every element, and players who’ve run a Dragonblood Sorcerer will feel more than a little validated reading the series.</p> <h3 id="h-2-the-sword-of-shannara-by-terry-brooks" data-injectable="false">2. The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks</h3> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MTV and Spike</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">One of the DMs in my local <em>D&amp;D</em> group has weaponized the art of the “mid-campaign twist.” Every game he runs shifts pitch at the halfway mark, re-contextualizing everything we’ve done up until that point in shocking and exciting ways. Terry Brooks<em> Shannara</em> series does something very similar, and D&amp;D fans who know what it’s like to watch the world you’ve adventured through turn upside down will feel a bit of nostalgia reading it.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">At the onset, the <em>Shannara</em> books feel like a near-complete rip-off of Tolkien, with elves, young naive warriors, and magical MacGuffins designed to kill evil overlords. However, as the books progress, shocking secrets about the world of Shannara are unmasked, and readers are left to grapple with the knowledge that this world might not be as fantastical as it appeared at first glance.</p> <h3 id="h-1-discworld-by-terry-pratchett" data-injectable="false">1. Discworld by Terry Pratchett</h3> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Paul Kidby</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">What is <em>D&amp;D, </em>if not the perfect blend of fantasy? The game gives you all the tools you’d ever need to slot every fantastical creature and form of magic into your campaign setting; the only limits that exist are those in your imagination. For this reason, I believe that no fantasy book embodies the spirit of <em>D &amp; D</em> more than <em>Discworld.</em></p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="false">The flat realm of Discworld is a wonderous patchwork woven together with elements pulled from almost every mythology, religion, and folklore tradition in the world. Wizards, demons, gods, and Death himself exist harmoniously as part of a magical ecosystem where nothing feels out of place. As funny as it is profound, <em>Discworld</em><strong> </strong>is the perfect fantasy series for <em>D&amp;D</em> fans.</p>

<p id="LAZuoW"><strong>Type:</strong> Energy fusion rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Upgrade to the deluxe edition of The Final Shape</p>
<p id="OFtzMR">Tessellation is technically a <em>Final Shape</em> Exotic, even if it’s been available since 2023 for those who pre-ordered the <strong>deluxe edition</strong> of the expansion. And while upgrading to the deluxe edition is the only way to get this thing for the foreseeable future, it’ll eventually come to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-beyond-light-guide/22159754/destiny-2-exotic-archive-monument-to-lost-lights-currencies-spoils-conquest-cipher">Monument of Lost Lights</a>, where you can use an Exotic Cipher and some currency to purchase it.</p>
<p id="k5lxcv">If you’re trying to decide if Tessellation is worth the deluxe upgrade, here’s what it does. The Intrinsic Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Undecidable</strong>, which causes the weapon to adapt its damage type to match your current grenade type, as well as grant bonus grenade energy on kills. This allows you to get Strand or Stasis weapons in your Energy slot for the first time ever, which should be very helpful for the new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163822/prismatic-final-shape-interview-bungie">Prismatic subclass</a>.</p>
<p id="82QbQA">The secondary Exotic perk for Tessellation is <strong>Property: Irreducibile</strong>, which allows you to hold reload and suck your grenade into the weapon. You’ll then be able to fire that grenade out of your Tessellation, which creates an elemental explosion based on your grenade’s element.</p>
<p id="JKiAGH">The new expansion will also add a new Catalyst for Tessellation, which is still a mystery, but could introduce significant changes to the gun — like the Catalyst for Quicksilver Storm did back in <em>Lightfall</em>.</p>

<p id="xN6aYo"><strong>Type:</strong> Solar pulse rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Season pass rank 1</p>
<p id="QQxj7W">Red Death Reformed is, as the name suggests, a remake of Red Death — a beloved Exotic from the original <em>Destiny</em>. Red Death Reformed also shares some similar functionality to the Exotic hand cannon Crimson (also designed after the original Red Death), and is a Solar pulse rifle that heals you whenever you kill enemies.</p>
<p id="mcXie3">Red Death Reformed’s Intrinsic Exotic perk is <strong>Redemption</strong>, which causes final blows with the pulse rifle to Cure you and increase your reload speed. Reloading Red Death Reformed after you get a kill causes it to Cure nearby allies as well. The <strong>Inverse Relationship</strong> Exotic perk causes you to flinch less as well as gain increased handling and movement speed when you deal damage with Red Death Reformed. The Exotic pulse also deals more damage when your health gets low.</p>
<p id="7KniQJ">Based on testing at a preview event for <em>The Final Shape</em>, this pulse rifle its healing capabilities are very powerful, even when you’re playing by yourself. It’s a great pick if you’re struggling to complete an activity without dying, and you should consider using it in the Legendary version of <em>The Final Shape</em> campaign. </p>

<p id="OZ6kDL"><strong>Type:</strong> Solar sniper rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Currently unknown</p>
<p id="saR1uf">Still Hunt has three Exotic traits. Its Intrinsic perk is <strong>Cayde’s Retribution</strong>, which causes any Orbs of Power you collect or precision hits you land to charge Still Hunt’s Super meter. Once the meter is full, you can hold reload to fire three Golden Gun shots. These shots work just like Golden Gun for Hunters, meaning that each shot does more damage than the last, and it only fires one shot if you’re using the Exotic Hunter helmet Celestial Nighthawk. </p>
<p id="YCl4Bl">Its other two Exotic perks are <strong>Golden Munitions</strong>, which causes the weapon to gain bonus ammo whenever you activate Golden Gun, and <strong>Sharpshooter</strong>. Sharpshooter gives Still Hunt bonuses to target acquisition, aim down sight speed, and flinch resistance. All of those bonuses are enhanced when the Golden Gun mode is active, meaning you’ll be able to hit your shots even if you’re under fire.</p>
<p id="3b61iu">This weapon deals very impressive damage to majors, mini-bosses, and bosses. </p>

<p id="IEwCns"><strong>Type:</strong> Kinetic auto rifle<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Currently unknown</p>
<p id="rZ8j9H">Khvostov is an iconic Destiny weapon. The non-Exotic form is the first gun you pick up in both the original <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it was also a fully customizable Exotic back in the first game. It’s finally back in <em>Destiny 2</em> in its Exotic form, but has entirely new perks this time around.</p>
<p id="FypN2q">Khvostov 7G-0X’s main perk is called <strong>The Right Choice</strong>, which causes every seventh bullet to ricochet between enemies and deal additional damage. Its Exotic Trait is <strong>Eyes Up, Guardian</strong>, which causes Orbs of Power to strengthen the bounce effect, giving you bonus bounces and damage. If that wasn’t good enough, it also comes with the Shoot-to-Loot perk.</p>
<p id="sbYR3x">This gun is very powerful, acting almost like a Kinetic Sunshot. It’s especially potent when paired with the new Prismatic subclass, as it can charge both your Light and Darkness Transcendence meters.</p>

<p id="ilKgmN">While Bungie hasn’t announced it yet, we know via the Episode roadmap that each new Episode will come with both an Exotic weapon (Red Death Reformed, in this case), and a new Exotic mission.

<h2 id="RhrvWh"><strong>All Exotic armor in The Final Shape</strong></h2>
<p id="uILAJw">Not counting the Exotic class items, there are six new Exotic armor pieces in <em>The Final Shape</em> — two per class.

<p id="yL8zx5"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="a4Pd8g">The Exotic perk for Hazardous Propulsion is <strong>Danger Close</strong>, which causes weapon precision hits or kills to have a chance to load Kinetic Exodus rockets into the chest piece. Whenever you use your class ability, you’ll fire any stored Exodus rockets, which home in on enemy targets. Dealing damage with your Exodus rockets give you a temporary buff that increases all rocket launcher damage.</p>
<p id="U3y48z">This chest piece has a lot of potential for Titans. Not only do these rockets deal quite a bit of damage, but the boost to rocket launchers could seriously increase Titans’ DPS in boss fights.</p>

<p id="DVU9PB">The Exotic perk for Gifted Conviction is <strong>The Gift of Certainty</strong>, which causes you to unleash little Arc explosives whenever you activate Ascension or Tempest Strike. These explosives deal damage and Jolt targets. Jolting any nearby targets grants you increased damage resistance. </p>
<p id="Aqckx0">This chest piece plays nicely with Hunter’s new Ascension Aspect, which allows them to fly into the air. It also gives Hunters a nice defensive option while on Arc, as Jolt is a very powerful and common subclass verb.</p>

<p id="HMhus5"><strong>Type:</strong> Warlock chest<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Rahool the Cryptarch</p>
<p id="hB48jt">The Exotic perk for Mataiodoxia is <strong>Stylostixis</strong>, which causes any targets you damage with your Arcane Needle Strand melee to emit a Suspending burst when they die. If you land multiple Arcane Needles on a single target, an even larger Suspending burst will immediately occur. Killing any suspended targets grants you melee energy and your Arcane Needles can pierce Barrier Champions.</p>
<p id="w3L3se">This Exotic gives Strand Warlocks some additional options for Suspending targets — something the class is already good at doing. But perhaps more importantly, it gives Prismatic Warlocks a reliable way to Suspend enemies since they don’t have access to a Suspend grenade. </p>

<p id="8m7zDs"><strong>Type:</strong> Titan mark, Hunter cloak, Warlock bond<br><strong>How to get:</strong> Mysterious post-raid mission</p>
<p id="LGZBSU">The Exotic class items are the only Exotic armor pieces you won’t be able to get from Rahool the Cryptarch this episode. Instead, they’ll come from a mysterious activity that won't be released until after Guardians complete the raid on June 7. </p>
<p id="eBqU4w">As for the class items themselves, they may have different names, but they all function the same. Each class item — <strong>Essentialism</strong>, <strong>Stoicism</strong>, and <strong>Solipsism </strong>— has random rolls, and each will get one Exotic perk in its first column and one in its second column. The idea is that these class items let you mix and match multiple Exotic effects together. The perk pools are (mostly) different between the three classes, and (mostly) contain effects belonging to Exotics from their particularly class — i.e. Titans typically will only be able to use other Titan effects. </p>
<p id="Bxyn7X">The “spirit” versions of the perks on these class items aren’t the entire Exotic perks from the original Exotics, and are usually missing an effect. If you want to use Spirit of Abeyant on your Titan, for example, you’ll only get the three-pronged Suspending blasts from the Abeyant Leap Exotic. If you want to get Woven Mail whenever you Suspend an enemy — the other half of Abeyant Leap — you’ll need to wear that Exotic instead.</p>
<p id="20E0nu">Finally, these Exotic class items only work while you’re using the new Prismatic subclass, so keep that in mind. </p>
<p id="2zhpQ3">Below, here are the perk pools for each of the three Exotic class items:</p>

Step into the arena if you dare, and either rise to become champion, or fall forever in ignominy.” This is a long way of saying that the raid series will be a tournament arc in which players get to beat the crap out of cool enemies in an almost gladiatorial sport. It sounds like silly fun and gives the developers an excuse to basically throw whatever they want at us. That levity sounds in line with <em>Dawntrail</em>’s vacation vibes and is a welcome reprieve from the pretty lore-heavy and emotional raids we got in the last two expansions.<br></p><p>The other big reveal from the website is the Shades’ Triangle field operations.

Based on the description, it sounds like this will be a Bermuda Triangle-like location. “Even the most dauntless of sailors would sooner abandon ship than steer into Shades’ Triangle,” the blurb reads. “Be not fooled by the lush and fertile island you spy on the horizon─men and vessels alike have been lost to its allure, never to be seen again. Yes, the wisest choice is to dismiss it as mere illusion. But of course, there are inevitably those who cannot resist the call of adventure.” I’ll be curious to see if these field operations somehow incorporate ships, as we’ve seen a lot of those in trailers and it would fit the tropical vibe of the expansion. In any case, it’s sure to be a great place to level the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-dawntrail-job-classes-free-trial-xbox-1850691863">new Pictomancer and Viper jobs</a></span> quickly.</p><hr><p>There are a couple of smaller tidbits on the website, as well, including a short description of Beastmaster, the new limited job, as well as previously shown dungeons in the expansion.

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s tough being someone who, in the search for some sort of meaning in life, has arrived on video games as their foundation. I could have chosen a much worse passion, but I also could have probably picked one that would pass in normal conversation. Instead, no one I meet understands me. It’s lonely being better than everyone.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em> gets me. Unfortunately. It’s a bizarre game about loving one thing so much that it becomes the central source of your alienation.</p> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">I think. That’s as much as I could glean from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154780/Elation_For_The_Wonder_Box_6000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less-than-10-minutes of demo</a>.</p> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="ELATION FOR THE WONDER BOX 6000 - OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK TRAILER" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Pjq0MnoxsY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false"><em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>comes from Digital Tchotchkes, the creator of <em><a href="https://digitaltchotchkes.itch.io/go-fly-a-kite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go Fly a Kite</a></em>, which I should probably play. They describe the demo as, “it’s a costco free sample style demo.”</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">It starts off with a <em>Doom</em>-style text crawl telling you about the eponymous <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>, a game so transcendental that the protagonist suggests that it is the apogee of video games as an art. That if only more people played and understood it, then art wouldn’t have died. It is the protagonist’s goal to acquire this lost relic.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">This opening exposition turns out to be something the protagonist is posting on the internet. The outpouring of distilled, potent opinions leads to them getting death threats, followed by a permanent ban from their chosen forum. We’ve all been there.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">You’re then left to explore the wreckage of the protagonist’s life. You mouse around to see what’s interactive and then click on what you find to hear about it. Through this, you discover that society has continued its course toward refining the endorphin supply, which is part of why nobody remembers something as artful as <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000</em>. Easier access to simpler stimulation has caused the masses to lose their way.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">It’s difficult to tell if <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>is making fun of, or trying to explain, the perpetually repeating discourse of how things were better in the before times. Or both. Why not take the high ground over every other perspective?</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">It represents a part of myself I’m unable to take <em>too </em>seriously. Some people have to travel abroad or get lost in the desert to “find themselves.” I’ve always known myself. I like video games. I might enjoy video games to an extent that other people find annoying. The whole reason I’m here (on this site, I mean) is that I want to support and spread the things I’m passionate about. It keeps me occupied until a bus finally decides to hit me.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">But also, and I can’t stress this enough, the <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000 </em>demo could be finished in less than 10 minutes. In that time, you look at stuff, talk to a person, and then walk to a place. That’s it. It could maybe be defined as the prologue. The game part of the game is beyond that demo wall.</p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t really get me <em>more</em> excited to play <em>Elation for the WonderBox 6000,</em> but it also doesn’t make me <em>less</em> excited. I was just so disoriented when it ended.</p>
 <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, it refers to the protagonist’s computer as “My portal to philistines,” which is what I will now call mine.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-do-abilities-work-in-ea-sports-college-football-25.886722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-do-abilities-work-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-do-abilities-work-in-ea-sports-college-football-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Abilities are a new feature in <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> that differentiates players from the competition and gives your team an extra edge on game day. Here is everything you need to know about the multi-layered system. </p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Unlike the NFL, which has 32 teams featuring the best professional athletes in the world, EA Sports College Football 25 includes 134 schools, meaning there is a huge gulf in talent. Five-star recruits in high school go to huge programs like Alabama, while two and three-star recruits will find themselves at smaller schools in a less distinguished conference. </p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">To achieve that authentic feeling of a gap in skill between different programs, EA created abilities, so players who are destined to be drafted into the NFL one day or were the best athletes in high school feel like that on the field. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">In <em>College Football 25</em>, there are 80 different abilities categorized into physical or mental categories. Each group is further divided into four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. A player can have five physical and three mental abilities at most. For example, the Field General mental ability allows a player to identify blitzers post-snap for the bronze tier. As for the Platinum tier, the player can identify blitzers, a coverage shell, and disguised coverage pre-snap. </p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">An example of a physical ability is Downhill. The player will get slightly more broken tackles at Bronze after reaching max speed, and at Platinum, earn the ultimate ability to break tackles after reaching 80 percent of max speed.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">EA committed to making sure that the abilities aren’t too overpowered. In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, the development team used the Pocket Shield ability as an example. Offensive linemen will hold blocks better on standard passing players, but even at the Platinum tier, the distance to the first down doesn’t apply if it is more than 10 yards. Every ability is situational and won’t be available for every play, to make games still feel balanced. </p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">EA didn’t go into detail on how players go about acquiring abilities and upgrading them. We will learn more about abilities and their impact on every game mode closer to launch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167893/sony-days-of-play-sale-2024-ps5-slim-digital-edition-psvr-2-games-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony’s recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168001/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-silent-hill">State of Play showcase</a> may have given us a brief glimpse into the company’s plans for 2024 and beyond, but that probably does little if you were hoping for something you can play right now. That’s where the Days of Play sale comes in. Now through June 12th, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/">Sony is discounting dozens of PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 titles</a>, as well as accompanying <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#consoles">hardware</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/deals/days-of-play/#accessories">accessories</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-plus/#subscriptions">subscriptions</a>.</p></div><p>First things first, if you’re still looking to pick up a PS5 console, you can save $50 on the <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> and <strong>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</strong>, which are available for as low as $449 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrW9iY3e3">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>) and $399 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmrWxZIomR">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>), respectively. These match the lowest prices we’ve seen on the newer PS5 models, which are slightly slimmer than Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">original PS5 console</a>. They also sport two front-facing USB-C ports and an expanded 1TB of built-in storage (up from 825GB), though keep in mind that only the disc-based version can play physical games and other Ultra HD Blu-ray discs.&nbsp;</p><p>As an added bonus, PlayStation Plus members who buy directly from PlayStation will receive 12 months of Netflix Premium, the streaming service’s most expensive tier. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">Read our hands-on impressions of the PS5 “slim.”</a></h5></p><div><p>Sony’s new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><div><p>The PlayStation 5 Digital doesn’t come with a disc drive, but you can buy one separately if you later decide you want one. The console otherwise plays all of the same games as the version equipped with a disc drive.</p></div><p>Elsewhere on the hardware front, the <strong>PSVR 2</strong> is on sale starting at $449 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmonR1hkAm">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. That’s the best price we’ve seen on the virtual reality headset, which, sadly, often costs more than the PS5 that’s required to play it.</p><p>The PSVR 2’s price reflects its underrealized potential. Its launch library wasn’t the greatest, but it’s slowly and steadily building its catalog with a diverse selection of made-for-VR titles. This includes <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA09555_00-HZVRCALLMOUNTAIN"><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em></a>, which you can currently purchase from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1Q9X8VH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmNa6JwUFh">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstationvr2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle">PlayStation Direct</a> with a PSVR 2 starting at $499 ($100 off). The latest <em>Horizon </em>title is probably one of the better showcases for what Sony’s PC-grade VR headset is capable of, though new VR modes in AAA games like <em>Resident Evil 7 </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> are thrilling, to say the least.<em> </em></p><p>Additionally, if you buy a PSVR 2 directly from Sony and subscribe to PlayStation Plus, you’ll also get 12 months of Netflix Premium for free, which saves you about $276 over the course of a year. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23601368/sony-playstation-ps-vr2-review-virtual-reality">Read our PSVR 2 review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>Sony’s PSVR 2 offers eye tracking, effortless setup, and PC-grade VR without a PC (though it does require a PS5). It can also double as a virtual flatscreen for watching Blu-rays, streaming apps, and other content.</p></div><div><p>Sony sells a bundle consisting of its PSVR 2, controllers, and a physical copy of <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>&nbsp;for the PS5.</p></div><p>Now through June 9th, you can also save up to 30 percent on a <strong>12-month subscription to </strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/#subscriptions"><strong>PlayStation Plus via the PlayStation Store</strong></a>, which is stackable with existing subscriptions. The exact amount varies based on which plan you choose; however, the Essential tier is 20 percent off ($63.99), the Extra tier is 25 percent off ($101.24), and the Premium tier is 30 percent off ($111.99).</p><p>The entry-level <strong>Essential</strong> plan allows you to download free PS Plus games monthly, which are accessible for as long as you’re a subscriber to PlayStation Plus. It also unlocks multiplayer access in games that require it, exclusive discounts, and advanced console features like cloud storage and Share Play. <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong>, meanwhile, offers the same set of perks as well as access to hundreds of titles that rotate regularly, including those that are part of Ubisoft Plus. If you step up to <strong>PS Plus Premium</strong>, you can add game trials, cloud streaming, and access to even more PlayStation classics and a selection of Sony Pictures films.</p><div><p>PlayStation Plus offers three tiers — Essential, Extra, and Premium. All of these subscriptions offer online play, with varying degrees of downloadable games and advanced console features included as part of the membership.</p></div><p>A PlayStation sale without discounted games would be odd, so it’s no shocker that hundreds of digital PS4 and PS5 games are currently on sale. Most are up to 60 percent off, but you’ll find opportunities to save as much as 85 percent on select titles during the various 24-hour flash sales that will be available throughout the event.</p><p>But if you happen to miss something juicy there, you can still find great prices on newer exclusives like <em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></em>, which is on sale starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqTht7xXI">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MARVELSPIDERMAN2">PlayStation Store</a>. The digital deluxe edition is also available for $59.99 ($20 off) from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA03016_00-MSM2DDE000000000">PlayStation Store</a>, while the collector’s edition is down to $149.99 ($80 off) in the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-games/marvels-spider-man-2-collectors-edition-ps5">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>. The latter includes physical extras like a steelbook case and a 19-inch Venom statue featuring Peter Parker and Miles Morales, plus two in-game suits and various skill unlocks.</p><div><p>Insomniac’s latest <em>Spider-Man</em> romp for the PlayStation 5 ups the ante with a vast open world to explore, wonderful web-slinging mechanics, and the ability to play as not one but two spider-men. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><div><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> is also worth a look, especially now that it’s on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0783148264580163">PlayStation Store</a>. The modern rendition of Square Enix’s classic JRPG is actually beating the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167183/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-deal-sale-ps5">price we recently called out for the physical copy</a>, though you can also pick up the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA08666_00-0978938405039882">digital deluxe edition on sale for $67.49</a> (about $23 off).</p></div><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>Unsurprisingly, you can also find sales on third-party PS4 and PS5 titles spanning multiple genres. For example, sports gamers looking to crack a bat can pick up <em><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></em> starting at $49.69 (about $20 off) at <a href="https://howl.me/cmmqU7HmZMx">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmlb-the-show-24-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-91019524">Target</a>, and the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA17085_00-MLBTHESHOW24SHIP">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>If you’re not into baseball, there’s also <em><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></em>, which is easily 2K’s best wrestling game yet. It refines some of the more recent gameplay modes and adds new match types, including an ambulance match, a casket match, and a special guest referee. Right now, the base version is on sale for $52.49 (about $18 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24CROSSGEN0">PlayStation Store</a>.</p><p>The base game is great on its own, but if you’re looking to get the most out of it, I’d recommend grabbing the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-PPSA16306_00-WWE2K24WMEDITION"><strong>40 Years of WrestleMania Edition</strong> for $89.99 ($30 off)</a>. It offers accelerators, boosters, and all five character packs planned for the game, including the new ECW Punk Pack that adds hardcore legends like CM Punk, The Dudley Boyz, Sandman, and Terry Funk.</p><div><p><em>MLB The Show 24</em> features photorealistic graphics, an updated roster with your favorite players, and some of the best baseball gameplay around.</p></div><div><p><em>WWE 2K24</em> is the newest wrestling game for the sports entertainment promotion. It builds on the incredibly fun gameplay of the prior two titles and adds in new game modes, match types, and a bigger roster than ever.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more Days of Play highlights</h3></p><div><ul><li><em><strong>Tekken 8</strong></em> is one of the fiercest fighting games out, and you can start practicing for <a href="https://www.evo.gg/events/las-vegas">July’s Evo tournament</a> with the Deluxe Edition, which is currently on sale for $69.99 ($30 off) in the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA10595_00-TK8DXEDITION0000">PlayStation Store</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1b8eU5">The streaming era operates via a cold and opaque calculus. Many shows unceremoniously premiere with limited promotion, only to face swift cancellation with an equal lack of fanfare. With no real numbers and a few dodgy reports available to the public and creators (now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023">a little less dodgy</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">the Writers Guild of America strike</a>), a show’s fate can feel like a cosmic joke, with no rhyme or reason to why some soldier on and some never get the chance to find an audience. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, the stunning animated series that debuted on Max last year, found its number was up when the streamer <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-streaming-1235912035/">canceled it earlier this May</a>. However, in a rare moment of clarity, there is a way forward for the show: It just has to be a hit starting Friday, when it premieres on Netflix. </p>
<p id="wtlh8m">Its new summer home (<em>Scavengers Reign</em> is still available to stream on Max) is <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-1235998046/">reportedly considering a season 2 renewal</a> pending the show’s Netflix debut, though what a favorable run looks like isn’t terribly clear. Mostly, this is just an excuse to exercise a rare bit of streaming-era agency: Go check out <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23599935/best-tv-shows-2023-new">the very best shows of last year</a>, and the rare series that earns the superlative of “like nothing else on television” simply by virtue of its stunning visual design. </p>

<p id="ROllfO">Taking visual cues from European sci-fi artists like Moebius and Simon Roy, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> chronicles the aftermath of a disaster aboard the spacecraft Demeter, following a handful of survivors that escaped to the alien world of Vesta Minor, a hauntingly beautiful and hostile planet. Yet survival is only a secondary concern for show creators Joe Bennett and Charles Huettner. Instead, the pair use <em>Scavengers Reign</em> as an exercise in crafting a truly alien world, with all of the awe and horror that entails. As our reviewer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max">wrote</a> when the show premiered last fall: </p>
<blockquote><p id="4fJH7x">Creature design and worldbuilding are one and the same in <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. Every animal, from the tiniest insect or docile herbivore to the most colossal and terrifying carnivore, exhibits a behavior that serves a function both within the moment-to-moment beats of an episode and in the larger ecosystem of Vesta Minor as a whole.</p></blockquote>

<p id="jiOdJA">Furthermore, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> isn’t merely concerned with creepy-gorgeous tourism. Instead, like <em>Jurassic Park</em>, its xenobiology doubles as potent metaphor, with each strange encounter a heartbreaking echo of some barely voiced pain each character carries. Why, for example, is the survivor Kamen haunted by his wife when a strange psychic quadruped holds him in its thrall? When local flora begins to infect the circuitry of Levi, the robotic companion of the stranded Azi, Levi begins to show signs of real, bona fide life in her synthetic shell — why does Azi seem so reluctant to see it? And Sam and Ursula, the only two humans stranded together, struggle to survive while maintaining harmony with the strange new land, but can that be done? Or is their effort inherently destructive? </p>
<p id="NiihK2"><em>Scavengers Reign</em> probes at heavy questions, lingers in moments of beauty and horror, and does it all with wonderfully rendered, languidly paced animation from studio Titmouse. Like all good art, it leaves plenty of room for the viewer to participate in it, to mull it over and think about what meaning might be found within. It’s the sort of story that’s done something wonderful, and stands a pretty good chance of dazzling us all once more, if given the opportunity. </p>
<p id="THD2fY">Give it a shot on Netflix this weekend. Maybe the show will get another season because of it, and maybe not. But what’s here ought to be celebrated. </p>

<p>Back at The Game Awards 2023, SEGA announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was making five new games</a> based on classic franchises like Golden Axe, Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage. Six months later, reliable insider Midori has an update the development of various games in the lineup.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796576390554501581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy Twitter thread</a>, Midori said that a number of the games have been pushed to a fiscal year 2028, including Games as a Service (GaaS) titles based on Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. These GaaS titles would be coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the full Unreal Engine 5 remakes</a> of Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio.</p>



<p>“Internally, both the Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi plans had already been previously delayed two different times, including the original reveal dates for the projects.,” he said. “The previous plan before this month was to release Jet Set Radio remake and reboot in 2026 and Crazy Taxi in 2027.” </p>



<p>She continued: “The Remake titles were supposed to release a short while before the reboots for fans of the original titles who did not want to play the GaaS reboots that are currently in development.”</p>



<p>Speaking of the remakes, she says that the Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio remakes were “very similar” to the originals. They will have some feature improvements and additions, however, including multiplayer for Crazy Taxi. Day one cosmetic DLC is also planned for the games.</p>



<p>In addition to those two games, Midori says that Golden Axe was originally planned to release in 2023. It got to the point that marketing plans were created for the game, but then, obviously, plans changed internally with the game not yet officially revealed. </p>



<p>“And now SOA [SEGA of America] is more involved in development and marketing of SEGA titles than before,” she said. “And communication has become more consistent between SOA and SOJ for these titles as part of global initiative. It is not just for Sonic titles.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[1000xResist Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/1000xresist-review.886674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/1000xresist-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“Just be grateful you get to say goodbye.” “There’s nothing here for you anymore.” “Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing.” Simple one-liners like these are plentiful in the early conversations of 1000xResist, a story-driven game set in a far-flung future where humanity's scant remains live on through generations of clones. It’s easy to see that kind of writing and get the impression developer Sunset Visitor is perhaps a bit too eager to be melodramatic – but it trusts you’ll stick with it because their delivery and the context around them make moments like these as thoughtful as they are gut-wrenching. A striking visual style and an intoxicating mystery pull you in as its ambitious narrative structure comes together brilliantly, and in the process, its sharply written story makes bold and daring statements about family, political revolution, and the things that make us human.</p><p>It’s quite clear that 1000xResist draws from works like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">NieR: Automata</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time-review">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>, or Satoshi Kon films, all of which blend surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition. You can use that as shorthand to get an idea of what this game goes for, but it quickly shows you that it’s so much more than just an amalgamation of influences. 1000xResist forges a strong identity steeped in its own fiction, establishing a wholly unique sci-fi world with its own culture, rules of governance, and belief systems – it does so with such confidence that I even found myself reciting the phrases its characters use throughout – a little “Hekki ALLMO,” or “Hair to hair,” goes a long way in these streets. That’s a microcosm of the experience; finding things which may not mean much at first glance that evolve into meaningful expressions that cut like a knife.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>1000xResist Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You spend most of your time controlling Watcher, one of six “Sisters” who are the leadership of a small civilization surviving in isolation on a remote station. They’re only referred to by the titles that represent their societal function, and it’s the Allmother, from which everyone was derived, who’s the godlike figure they all seem to revere. The story starts with a jolt by showing Watcher violently drive a shiv into the Allmother’s back, and the intensity of Watcher’s rage gives a staggering first impression – one that grows evermore shocking as you develop a deeper understanding of who the Allmother was. Unraveling this world also revolves around a deadly pandemic that wiped out nearly all of humanity, and the ensuing aftermath sets the foundation for why a society of clones made in her image exists at all.</p><p>You spend much of your time “communing” with other Sisters by navigating dreamlike scenarios, gradually uncovering a greater truth within surreal reconstructions of the Allmother’s memories. Interacting with characters and shifting through different time periods in various locations let conversations play out like pieces to a puzzle. Exploring these ethereal environments paints a more complete and harrowing picture of her life, and literal changes in perspective draw you into each scenario with specific intent – whether it’s through first-person, fixed camera angles, side-scrolling scenes, or third-person views as you fly across nodes to reach objectives, 1000xResist isn’t afraid to break both convention and expectation at critical points.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>1000xResist is a revolution in storytelling.</p></div><p>The station where the Sisters live acts as a main hub and has the vibe of a small-scale Citadel from Mass Effect. Spending time here to talk to the other Sisters and their understudies reveals crucial details that pull you closer to their world and way of life, and there’s so much charm and insight that comes through in these one-off conversations. Although it’s a bit of a pain to navigate, since the station is constructed in some really odd ways with winding hallways that don’t always lead to where you’d expect, it’s always worth the trouble. Even in its unsettling atmosphere where something always feels a little <em>off</em>, it’s still a sort of home that evokes a certain sentimentality.</p><p>Buried within the memories of the Allmother are pieces of her normal life; traces of her relationships at school, a tumultuous upbringing in a home with struggling parents, and some troubling decisions she made along the way. These moments are deeply personal, and distinctly born of the Asian diaspora. 1000xResist is rooted in the experience of a Chinese family coming to the west to seek refuge and rebuild a life from scratch while raising a child. Even when there were specific references to Chinese traditions and Mandarin phrases I wasn’t familiar with (but was always excited to learn about), it was all still so familiar to me, as if there could’ve been an alternate version of this exact story transposed with Filipino traditions and Tagalog phrases. It’s a cathartic and authentic representation of the common ground Asian Americans/Canadians share, extending to anyone who grew up a first generation from an immigrant family – the disconnect we feel from being pushed into assimilating and functioning in a western society while clinging on (sometimes reluctantly) to the cultures of our motherland. It's also an open invitation to those on the outside to see what our lives are really like, and a shining example of how <em>the local is universal</em>.</p><p>In my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review"><u>Persona 3 Reload review</u></a> from earlier this year, I had mentioned that its story and characters put a lot of the recent tragedies and hardships in my own life into perspective. By the time I rolled credits on 1000xResist, it had done the same but in a way that felt more <em>targeted</em>. From the feeling of “making it” when you’ve moved into a tiny apartment to the olive branches parents extend to their angsty teen kids to keep them connected to their culture, these are visions of a life so many of us have lived. 1000xResist is a representation of how we reflect on our upbringing and recognize the ways it shaped us as adults for better and worse, which is perspective that only comes with time and maturity.</p><p>1000xResist’s cultural foundation never becomes self-indulgent because it is the critical context that deftly creates a complete and nuanced depiction of why its world came to be. It forms a powerful connection with the Allmother and establishes the disposition for which all the Sisters share. So, to fully understand 1000xResist is to also understand generational trauma, the damage it leaves on its victims, and the ripple effect it has on those around them. Breaking cycles requires radical action, and whether that be ending harmful habits with our loved ones or upending an unjust status quo, this is a story that believes, and demonstrates how, these two must be closely intertwined.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It dissects the immigrant experience to show something greater than simple representation.</p></div><p>There are allusions to the history of Hong Kong protests that are sometimes used as reference for what sets 1000xResist in motion, but like its other parts, that’s only a jumping off point as the story carves its own path. Tales of rebellion and uprising are aplenty in other games since they provide you with clear motivations, but rarely do you see a game walk you through radicalization on such an intimate level – 1000xResist is the perfect example of “show, don’t tell.” It’s masterfully written to appeal to our humanity rather than preach its politics alone, and it’s far more impactful when the onus is on you to really understand what it’s trying to say. That speaks to how effectively the folks at Sunset Visitor wield their real-world influences and lived experiences as a foundation to tell a story that inspires change, and isn’t afraid to show how cruel and heartbreaking that can be.</p><p>1000xResist doesn’t shy away from the complexities, dangers, and unintended consequences of taking action and following through on a just cause. And it’s smart about where it draws its lines in the sand, expertly identifying how fascism manifests in subversive and insidious ways. It’s easy to depict the boot of corrupt and violent systems crushing the powerless, but watching historical revisionism erase what a people once were (and manipulate those around you) is just as chilling to see unfold. So, what happens when those people are pushed to the brink, and the most desperate begin to push back? These are just a few of the concepts that 1000xResist navigates effortlessly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s often dark with an underlying dread lingering over its more broad story elements. However, that wouldn’t work as effectively as it does without the interpersonal dynamics that drive 1000xResist. In just its 12-hour runtime, fully formed characters are created, with rich personalities that anchor the story’s bold themes. Without that heart and soul, there is no inspiration for a revolution, but this is <em>far </em>from the power of friendship trope often used in stories to save the day. These are realistically flawed characters with believable and complicated relationships. Constant tension and skepticism tests their trust in each other as the systems they’ve lived under start to come under question, and during the moments in between are sobering examples of what it takes to be vulnerable with somebody.</p><p>Another impressive aspect is that every single line of dialogue is voiced and delivered with intent. The voice acting doesn’t come across like a star-studded cast reading from a well-rehearsed script, but actual people in my life speaking to me in a natural setting. It trades theatrics for something authentic, and it’s far more effective for what this story is trying to say. This helps ground its sentimentality, so when characters share their own aspirations or open up to each other, there’s a genuine warmth instead of a cloying melodrama. And when they break down from the traumatic experiences they endure, it’s as if I’m there to console one of my own friends. For as dark as things may get, 1000xResist evokes a certain tenderness and levity in the face of tragedy.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p>The fact that the details of this world aren’t delivered through optional journal entries, a codex in the menus, or long-winded exposition is a testament to how 1000xResist is purposeful in its writing and doesn’t waste its breath. But that’s also a credit to the strength of its art direction and visual storytelling. The shot composition of each sequence and the cinematography of its cutscenes communicate so much of what doesn’t need to be outright said. 1000xResist isn’t a graphically impressive game, but it is certainly a visually striking one. Colors are used as a storytelling device, setting the mood without a word by letting them pop in specific instances. Even though it relies on a basic set of animations, the camera work captures the emotions of its characters to emphasize their most important lines, whether it be off-center close-ups or panning environmental shots. Sunset Visitor flips its technical limitations into one of its greatest assets, letting its creative techniques speak as loud as its words.</p><p>“Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.” “You should appreciate people that see you for who you are.” “You must learn to live with the mistakes you’ve made.” Simple one-liners like these powerfully encapsulate the defining moments of 1000xResist. In its melodrama, it inspires self-reflection and asks us to take stock of what we value most. As fleeting or short-lived as our most cherished memories may be, they can still leave a profound impact on us for the rest of our lives. And when we take a step back to reflect on our place in the world, the hope is that they inspire future action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The next entry to the beloved <em>Monster Hunter </em>series is on its way, continuing the hunt that started from the original. Here’s everything you need to know about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, including a release window, platforms, and more.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-monster-hunter-wilds-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Monster Hunter Wilds come out?</h2> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">As of now, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> <strong>does not have a set release date</strong>, but it is slated for a 2025 launch. Some rumors have been floating around regarding an early 2025 debut, but these should be taken with a grain of salt. Hopefully, Capcom will make an announcement soon to give us a better time frame.</p> <h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-monster-hunter-wilds-be-on" data-injectable="false">What platforms will Monster Hunter Wilds be on?</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will be available to play on <strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>. It’s currently available for wishlist via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005176/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. The Xbox version has yet to make its own store page, so we’ll need to wait for this specific platform.</p>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">As for Switch, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t currently planned for it. <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-monster-hunter-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> did appear on Switch, but it currently looks like PC and beefier consoles are where <em>Wilds </em>is staying for now.</p> <h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-trailers" data-injectable="false">Monster Hunter Wilds trailers</h2> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">The Game Awards 2023 revealed the very first trailer for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds. </em>It gave us a short sneak peek of various monsters and the formidable Forbidden Lands.</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyoBA0aCRNk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">We also see the playable character riding the new mount, Seikret. Not only is this creature used for traveling, but it can be an excellent asset for hunts. You can utilize it to stash away multiple gear, allowing you to heal and equip several weapons.</p> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-a-first-look-at-its-gameplay-in-the-latest-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play 2024</a> also gave us a first look into gameplay. It focuses more on the game’s combat side, presenting several brutal showdowns.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 1st Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2u6VmVmhh-k?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">The trailer shows creatures like the Doshaguma, a fanged beast that lingers in the Windward Plains. We also get a glimpse of the reptilian-like Chatacabra, which uses its saliva to power up its attacks.</p>
 <h2 id="h-will-monster-hunter-wilds-be-open-world" data-injectable="false">Will Monster Hunter Wilds be open world?</h2> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Since there is little information about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’</em> gameplay, it needs to be clarified whether the game will be open-world or not. However, the trailer may hint at this feature, mainly because it includes changing environments.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> page mentions two hunting locales: a formidable location with challenging monsters and a much more peaceful area. Creatures also have designated ecosystems, where you’ll primarily start in the Windward Plains.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="false">Due to these unique environmental attributes, an open-world feature may pan out for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> We’ll have to wait and see what Capcom confirms.</p>

The card has decent stats and playstyles at an affordable price, but nothing that’s meta-defining. However, the SBC is certainly well-worth its costs in terms of required fodder. </p>

			<p>Today, Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Little Nightmares III has been delayed to 2025. The developer and publisher jointly shared this message on Twitter/X:</p>
<p><em>Ever since the announcement of Little Nightmares III at gamescom last year, we've been thrilled to see our community buzzing with excitement and anticipation. </em><br>
<em>The teams at Supermassive Games and Bandai Namco Europe have been working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise. As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. </em><br>
<em>For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025. We'll be sharing more about Little Nightmares III later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live. Here's what little we know about Little Nightmares III:</p>
<p><em>In Little Nightmares III, you follow the journey of Low &amp; Alone, as they search for a path that could lead them out of the Nowhere. Trapped within the Spiral, a cluster of disturbing places, the two friends will have to work together to survive in a dangerous world full of delusions and escape the grasp of an even greater threat lurking in the shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>For the first time in the franchise, face your childhood fears together with a friend in online co-op, or in solo with an AI companion.</em></p>
<p>Little Nightmares III will be released for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Unofficially, we all know a PC version is likely in the works. Historically, Rockstar has done this many times: Announce a game for consoles, release it, then announce a PC version, and launch that later. But until a <em>GTA 6</em> PC port is officially confirmed and announced, it seems like everyone who works at Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two must be vague  about all of this. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>VGC </em>on May 31</a></span>, when recently asked about <em>GTA 6</em> coming to PC during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a></span> at a  conference this week, we got this fun word salad from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement. I guess that could happen, too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone. But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before. And they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time. Okay?</p></blockquote><p>You can definitely read between the lines here and pull from this answer that, yeah, duh, <em>GTA 6</em> is going to get ported to PC. Rockstar always focuses on consoles first, then PC after that. It followed this playbook with <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA IV</em>. Zelnick alludes to that by saying “Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before.” </p><p>But again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/some-reasons-why-the-games-industry-is-so-secretive-an-1825929139">because the industry is obsessed with secrecy</a></span> and holding back every announcement for future events and trailers, Zelnick has to dance around the obvious. You never know when you’ll need to use the announcement of <em>GTA 6</em> on PC as leverage!</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is set to arrive in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And I bet in 2026 or sooner you’ll get a PC port, just don’t ask anyone at Rockstar or Take-Two about it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It features robot versions of characters from every console generation, and used old console hardware and peripherals as props. It’s evident by just how many references are in its first trailer that <em>Astro Bot </em>is continuing the tradition with a mix of nods to huge PlayStation hits and deep cuts from the brand’s rich past. Here are the characters, consoles, and peripherals we saw in these few minutes of footage.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-recommend-id="image://616025e89eca6f8a9d5748d6981cdbed" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro hurries a crowd of robots." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Right off the bat, we get several references to PlayStation characters in the form of the PlayStation Studios logo screen. Astro leads a stampede of robots, some dressed as PlayStation characters. The menagerie includes <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos and Atreus, Aloy from <em>Horizon</em>, Spike and an ape from <em>Ape Escape</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, and Ratchet from <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>. Most of these characters will show up again later in the trailer, but it’s not the full extent of the PlayStation heroes that will make an appearance in <em>Astro Bot</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-recommend-id="image://2e9544f6253927b245c870e2a839a29c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Astro jumps on the DualSense ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the very first things we see, after being reintroduced to Astro Bot, is a DualSense controller, the PlayStation 5’s next-gen version of the famous Dualshock.

The dungeon crawler first released on PC in early 2020, and came to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://wolcengame.com/forum/announcements/official-news/future-game/">Wolcen Studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> confirmed the news on its website, adding that the game will lose multiplayer functionality on that same day. The single-player mode will still be playable, sold at a "permanently reduced price" to accommodate for what's being lost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developer explained that "foundational hurdles" prevent future improvements to the action-RPG, which it says can't happen without a "complete technology overhaul." As such, it'll apply what it's learned toward new projects guided by its first game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've learned a lot from developing and supporting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolcen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," it wrote.

Like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wolcen</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it determined the shooter's then-current state wasn't really sustainable or a good fit for the live-service model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Its next project, which is set in the same universe, will effectively be a stronger iteration of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with less live-service in it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More recently, look at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/multiversus-returns-with-over-114k-concurrent-players-at-launch">MultiVersus</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
