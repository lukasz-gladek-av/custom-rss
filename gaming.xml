In November you could battle Snoop Dogg and Eminem while sporting a brand new pair of Nikes on your amorphous blob-creature. It’s a corporate soup of cameos and crossovers which, viewed from the outside, can appear rather gross. And now, Mariah Carey of all people might be getting in the mix?</p><p>I’m a recent convert to <em>Fortnite</em>, drawn in by my 10-year-old, having made the lazy (but understandable) mistake of thinking it just a cacophony of cartoonish noise. It turns out, beneath the corporate tie-ins and embarrassing celebrity endorsements, it’s one hell of a solid online shooter. I thoroughly enjoy playing, ideally in Duos with the boy, but spend a lot of time playing solo too. Thanks to some superb, parkourish movement (made even better in this latest season with wall-scrambling, roly-poly landings and samurai-sword-induced double-jumps), excellent gun fighting, and a vast variety in approaches, I’ve found my groove.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the corporate nonsense grates <em>less</em>, but once through the looking glass you can at least appreciate why people put up with it. And...sometimes it’s fun?</p><p>Given that November’s shorter so-called “Remix” season (which brought back season 2's map and dreary weapons) featured Snoop, Ice Spice, Eminem and Juice Wrld, the idea that Mariah Carey might be hiding in a vast block of ice (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as she apparently so often does</a></span>) doesn’t seem very far-fetched. Heck, at the end of Remix, there was a (stunning) slightly interactive event in which an Ice Spice the size of a skyscraper performed a gig in New York City, while titanic Eminems fought one another and a Juice Wrld as big as the solar system sang as players jumped around the rings of Saturn. It’s tough to rule anything out after that.</p><p>Anyhoo, that’s what the leakers are saying is due to happen in just a couple of days:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gaming World Tour has wrapped for 2024, and after a year of stellar events, the team is looking forward to what comes next in 2025. This year, the squad – including Jake Lucky and Hunter Grooms – travelled to South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Germany, but in 2025, they’ll be going bigger and broader at every event.</p>



<p>Here are the events that the team at Gaming World Media is most looking forward to for 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-around-the-world-with-gwm">Around The World With GWM</h2>



<p>I caught up with Jake and Hunter recently, eager to learn about their most anticipated events coming in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tokyo-games-show-japan">1. Tokyo Games Show (Japan)</h3>



<p><em>Tokyo Games Show is an event that has been on our radar for a long time, as one of the biggest games shows out there. After visiting Korea for G-STAR, I can’t even begin to imagine how much bigger and better TGS will be.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-2-blast-austin-major-united-states">2. BLAST Austin Major (United States)</h3>



<p><em>A North American Major is extremely exciting for us, as we get to see all the NA Counter-Strike fans come out to enjoy the esport. Esports events don’t often happen in North America, so the excitement that surrounds something like this is definitely something to look forward to.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-3-runefest-united-kingdom">3. Runefest (United Kingdom)</h3>



<p><em>As a lifetime RuneScape fan, Runefast has been something I wanted to attend since I was a kid. After hearing that Jagex is working on a new open-world survival game, I’m even more excited to see what they have in store.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-4-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">4. Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The EWC really just gives us some of the best access to multiple esports and players. Being able to hop from stage to stage and put out loads of coverage and interviews is a perfect scenario for us.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-5-six-invitational-boston-united-states">5. Six Invitational Boston (United States)</h3>



<p><em>Though I can’t expect the Six Invitational to match up to the hype it had this past year, I’m still thrilled that the event is in North America. We had a lot of fun with the Rainbow Six crowd and Ubisoft this past year, so I can’t wait to run it back in Boston.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The longtime franchise mode in the Madden NFL series lets players make decisions for their favorite team, such as drafting players and signing free agents. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making. In fact, Johnson reportedly axed a trade this past offseason involving a wide receiver because the player's rating in Madden NFL 24 was too low.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Jets were close to agreeing to a trade with the Denver Broncos in March for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. But then, Johnson reportedly killed negotiations after looking at Jeudy's Madden NFL 24 rating. Electronic Arts tweaks player ratings throughout the season, but <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/24/madden-nfl-24-denver-broncos-ratings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Denver Post</a> notes that Jeudy was an overall 83 before the start of last season. Interestingly enough, the wide receiver--who ultimately was traded to the Cleveland Browns--still sports the same <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/ratings/player-ratings/jerry-jeudy/20940"

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September. It won the award for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024</a>. This year's show also introduced the "Game Changer" award for Amir Satvat, who has helped laid-off game developers find openings at other companies over the last year.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2 review</a>, we said, "Frostpunk 2's challenging gameplay makes for a compelling experience despite a dour and cynical view of human nature."</p>

		<p>Having skin is kind of overrated, don’t you think? Looking like a bad guy getting flayed after opening the Ark of the Covenant is definitely the look for the 2100s, and you will soon be able to prove that beauty is more than skin deep with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76’s</a> playable Ghouls when they arrive in early 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hands on Fallout 76 Playable Ghouls –&nbsp;Grabbed by the Ghoul-ies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH2vPV7a4t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, with Ghouls being more popular than ever thanks to Walter Goggins’ star turn as a bounty hunting Ghoul in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">Fallout TV series</a>, you’ll soon be able to play as a Ghoul yourself in Fallout 76. But you aren’t born &nbsp;with it, and it definitely doesn’t involve make up. No, you’ll have to undertake a quest to be all Ghoul-ified once you’re deep into this game – you need to have a level 50 character, to be precise.</p>


<p>It all starts when you pick up a radio transmission from a distressed man who’s just about survived and attack by some rather ghastly bandits, and should you follow up on the call track Leman down as he visits the human doctor, it quickly becomes clear that he’s not going to be long for this world. The only chance he has it to find a… different kind of doctor and scientist way up in the North East of the map. Maybe they someway, somehow have a solution?</p>
<p>Well, since they’re part of a secretive society of Ghouls, they might have a thought or two on how to handle lethal doses of radiation, and so their solution is to transform Leman into a Ghoul himself. Along the way you’re given some almost perfunctory decisions to make. Do you egg Leman on and encourage him to accept the transformation to join this small community of outcasts? And following that, will you more willingly choose to become a Ghoul yourself?</p>


<p>There’s a ton of reasons why you might want to. You lose none of the stats and skills that you have from before, but there’s now a whole new endgame progression to engage in with 30 new Special cards focussed on all the special traits and abilities of the Ghoul characters.</p>
<p>The biggest perk is that Ghouls are not only resistant to the radiation that caused their transformation, it will actually help and heal you now. No need to avoid dirty water anymore, you can just slurp it up and eventually gain Glow, even. But you don’t really need to, since you’re no longer subject to hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>If that sounds like Fallout 76 easy mode, then there are some downsides as well. Instead of hunger and thirst, you have to manage your Feral meter which, if you let it get a bit out of hand will significantly debuff your ability to use ranged weapons, though your melee attacks are boosted quite a lot.</p>

<p>Being a Ghoul, pretty much all the regular humans will now absolutely detest you. Any cities and encampments will want to turn you away if you ever show your face, and the Brotherhood of Steel will really not take kindly to your presence… so you’ll now have to hide it. Visit makeover guru Jaye Vo within the Ghoul enclave’s bunker, and she will work wonders to help hide your ghastly appearance from view.</p>
<p>It’s a rather randomised process that can sometimes cover you up with a bandana and nice hat… or basically just wrap your head up in a bin bag with some breathing apparatus. It would be nice to have more flexibility here, as you don’t get to make the choice for what your disguise will be, and have to revisit Jaye Vo to swap between displaying your Ghoul publicly and keeping it private. It’s a bit clumsy and feels like you should have a little more of a handle on it alongside the rest of the customisation suite, where you still have a great deal of freedom to customise your Ghoul’s appearance, right down to the skin texture.</p>
<p>If that all becomes a bit too much, you will have the opportunity to revert from Ghoul-dom to being human. This can be done once for free, as Bethesda don’t really want people switching back and forth at the drop of a hat.</p>

<p>Still, it’s a rather attractive proposition, especially when considering the kinds of challenges that you will face in Fallout 76’s end game. There’s the recently released Gleaming Depths raid where the sequence of challenging boss fights could use a bit of added durability from your character build, for example, and there’s no doubt that radiation resistance will be handy at more than a few other instances across the irradiated wastelands.</p>
<p>Fallout 76 seems to be in a pretty good place right now. The lasting memory of this game for many will be of its rather rocky launch, but that’s more than six years ago now, and Bethesda has brought a lot of big updates into the mix, and introduced broader ideas, like MMO-style raids and map expansions. It’s not Fallout 5, of course, but similar to The Elder Scrolls Online, it can scratch some of that itch.</p>
<p>Oh man, I bet being a Ghoul is really itchy…</p>

		<p>Just before they presumably clock off for Christmas, GSC Game Worlds has released the first major update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. STALKER 2 patch 1.1 promised fixes for over 1,800 issues, including a first set of improvements for the game’s A-Life 2.0 system.</p>
<p>Since launch, A-Life 2.0 has been a major source of disappointment for players of STALKER 2. A-Life is responsible for a fluid game world that’s filled with AI characters and creatures going about their own business, even while a kilometer away from you. There could be factional battles that you never see, regions can change hands or be overrun by mutants overnight, and more. However, GSC seemingly had to make cuts and compromises to the system in order to get STALKER 2 out the door and with a decent frame rate, especially on Xbox Series X|S.</p>


<p>Now A-Life will be more able to spawn and exist in “offline” mode, which is when they’re outside of a player’s visualisation range, being more persistent to run into again later, and more able to take on tasks, like clearing out mutants. It’s a good first step to realising the potential of the system.</p>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes (with possible spoilers redacted) for STALKER 2 Patch 1.1:</p>


<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue with spawning NPCs behind the player’s back.</li>

<li>Players may now have opportunities to encounter A-Life NPCs they’ve previously met by following in the same direction as the NPCs.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tomorrow, Bethesda Game Studios will open up the gates of the Fallout 76 PTS (Public Test Server) to allow fans to play as a Ghoul for the first time in the franchise, likely in response to the massive acclaim enjoyed by the TV show's Cooper Howard character played by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they shared a few details with the press. Playing as a Ghoul (with customizable design and even skin texture) is an endgame experience, as the related quest only starts at level 50. Ghouls will have 'dozens of alternate ways' to specialize their character, according to the developers.</p>
<p>To begin with, they are not only immune to radiation; it actually heals them. If your character is hurt, standing on top of some radioactive material will start healing them. Moreover, once fully healed, the excess radiation will build up into a new resource called Glow. Depending on how the player character is specialized, Glow can provide various effects. Ghouls can also utilize 32 exclusive perk cards on top of those already available for human characters, providing great variety when it comes to character progression.</p>
<p>Ghouls do not feel hunger or thirst in Fallout 76. However, they must manage a feral meter instead. If a character turns full feral, they'll suffer from drawbacks like reduced hit points and worse accuracy with weapons, but they'll also get a boost in hand-to-hand combat, potentially unlocking a berserker type of playstyle.</p>

<p>Many NPCs (non-player characters) and factions will interact differently with player ghouls, such as the Brotherhood of Steel, who do not take kindly to ghouls. You won't be blocked from their stories, though; instead, this will reportedly open up new narrative paths to experience. Bethesda also said there will be in-world ways to disguise your being a Ghoul. Last but not least, player Ghouls will have the ability to revert to human form, though you will only be able to do this once for free.</p>
<p>There's no final release date for this update yet, although the developers aim to launch it sometime in early 2025. As a reminder, Fallout 76 was recently updated with a brand new raid experience called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>, an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MMO-style endgame dungeon</a> where a party of four players must go through five tough encounters to obtain the new four-star legendary weapons.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-great-apple-arcade-games-for-your-iphone-or-ipad.1065363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It was a bit of a weird year for Apple’s subscription gaming service. 2024 saw very few notable exclusives launch on Apple Arcade; instead, the service was fleshed out with a number of big games that you can already play on other platforms. It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. Here’s the best of what came out this year.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balatro/id6502451661"><em>Balatro Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>This poker game has been an unexpected hit ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">it launched on PC and consoles at the beginning of the year</a>. It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dicey-dungeons/id6477867401"><em>Dicey Dungeons Plus</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> is a few years old at this point — it originally launched on PC in 2019 — but if you missed this excellent release from Terry Cavanagh, now is a great time to jump in. Just like <em>Balatro</em>, it uses a roguelike structure, where your progress resets after every death, but every run is different. Here, the goal is to explore dungeons by fighting monsters and collecting loot, which is all done through an engrossing deckbuilding mechanic. Also, for some reason, you play as a die. If nothing else, it’s a great entry point to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/30/23181999/roguelike-deckbuilder-genre-slay-the-spire-inscryption">an intimidating genre</a>.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-iv-3d-remake/id6504607951"><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>Apple Arcade is slowly becoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">a pretty good place for roleplaying games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade">now that includes the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series</a>. First up is the 3D remake of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>, one of the most beloved entries in the long-running series, along with its direct sequel, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ff-iv-the-after-years/id6504608150"><em>The After Years</em></a>. Square Enix has done a pretty solid job of porting RPGs of late, so the mobile versions are well suited for your phone. Even better: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy/id6504607244">the original <em>Final Fantasy</em></a> is coming to Apple Arcade in January, in all its pixelated glory.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfl-retro-bowl-25/id6476767864"><em>NFL Retro Bowl ‘25</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Retro Bowl</em> (and its soccer sibling <em>Retro Goal</em>) is a very straightforward experience. It’s designed to bring the joyous simplicity of old-school sports games to modern smartphones. That means pixel art graphics, streamlined gameplay, and no fussing about with always-online features. The latest edition is no different, except that it has an NFL license, so you can enjoy that classic experience while controlling real football teams composed of real football players. The developers at New Star Games have also done a great job of keeping it updated since it launched in September.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outlanders-2/id1614682164"><em>Outlanders 2</em></a></h3></p><p>Perhaps the biggest Apple Arcade exclusive this year, this sequel is the follow-up to one of the most chill and beautiful city builders around. The new version of <em>Outlanders</em> has more detailed visuals, an evolving story campaign, and regular challenges for when you just need a quick fix. The sequel also brings the series to Macs, in addition to iOS and Apple TV.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/return-to-monkey-island/id6476317779"><em>Return to Monkey Island Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>It was a long wait for a proper <em>Monkey Island</em> sequel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23360869/return-to-monkey-island-review-nintendo-switch-pc">but it was worth it</a>. The point-and-click adventure sees original creative duo Ron Gilbert and Dave Grossman return, and while it has a very different visual style, the game itself is classic <em>Monkey Island</em>. Which is to say, it’s hilarious and full of all kinds of oddball puzzles to solve. This time, the game has also been streamlined to get rid of some of the more annoying aspects of the genre, with features like a hint system to keep you from getting really stuck.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337"><em>Vampire Survivors Plus</em></a></h3></p><p>You really need to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> to get it — but once you do, it’s hard to put down. The survival game starts out slowly, as you attempt to kill as many undead creatures before they overwhelm you. But over time, you’ll unlock new characters and abilities, allowing you to take on ridiculously large groups of enemies. This cycle continues for a long time, with a huge number of things to unlock to progress through the many, many levels.</p><p><h3><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/words-in-progress/id1021231678"><em>Words in Progress</em></a></h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">Daily puzzle games are everywhere now</a> following the breakout success of <em>Wordle</em>, and this is Apple Arcade’s best current entry. <em>Words In Progress</em> is a bit like a single-player take on Scrabble. You’re presented with a vertical list of letters, which you have to combine to create words in the hope of getting a high score. It’s one of those seemingly simple concepts that has a lot of replayability, helped along by multiple modes, including multiplayer and daily challenges to take on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony acquired the shares for 50 billion yen or roughly $300 million, bringing its total ownership to 10 percent and making it the Kadokawa’s largest shareholder.</p><p>The news comes after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300583/sony-kadokawa-acquisition-from-software-anime-manga">earlier rumors that Sony was considering acquiring the company</a> outright. Kadokawa confirmed that Sony had expressed interest in acquiring shares, but that, at the time, no decision had been made. An acquisition would have brought Kadokawa’s considerable holdings in Japanese movie, television, publishing, and video game production — which includes the <em>Elden Ring</em> developer and<em> Danganronpa</em> studio Spike Chunsoft — under Sony’s control. </p><p>Getting its hands on more IP seems to be the name of Sony’s game with this announcement. According to the press release, Sony and Kadokawa will, “discuss specific initiatives for collaboration” regarding adaptation, development, and production of Kadokawa IP.  Or to put it more simply, there’s now a not-small chance that an <em>Elden Ring</em> live-action movie might be on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommendsterrifier-3">Patrick Recommends...Terrifier 3</h3><figure></figure><p><strong>I'm Sorry For The Upsetting Image Above:</strong> Truly<br><strong>Should You Watch <em>Terrifier 1</em>?</strong> No. Hard no.<br><strong>Should You Watch <em>Terrifier 2</em>?</strong> Probably. Well. Maybe. Give me a second.<br><strong>Who Are These Movies For?</strong> Great question.</p><p>Even Patrick has his limits when it comes to horror movies. I have, for example, never seen <em>A Serbian Film</em>. Once I heard about a particular sequence, I was fine never experiencing that. And for a long time, that's where I was with the <em>Terrifier</em> movies, too. The second and third movies start carving out a legitimate mythology, sure, but the reason these movies exist, the reason they generate so much pop out of people watching them, is because they're so wildly and over-the-top gory. You might think "hey, man, I've seen a lot of violent movies," but the difference here is that <em>Terrifier</em> knows you've seen those movies and wants to go one step further, because it's a movie in conversation with itself as much as it's in conversation with fans of horror movies. It exists to climb a ladder whose rungs are cinema's history.</p><p>Do you want a litmus test for yourself? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOwAOAN_UQ8&amp;ref=remapradio.com">See how you respond to this scene.</a></p><p>If you've seen the <em>Terrifier</em> movies, here's a hint on that link: the bedroom scene.</p><p>Last holiday season, with some evening to myself, I finally watched the first two <em>Terrifier</em> movies, and came out the other side simultaneously confused and intrigued. I showed my wife the scene above and she immediately laughed and said "no, thank you," despite our relationship having been originally built on a foundation of watching scary movies. She saw nothing compelling in that clip.</p><p>Outside of completionism, I see no reason to watch the original movie. It's really long, mostly boring, and it's best bit is simply establishing the great Art the Clown. It's not until the sequel that <em>Terrifier</em>, as a series, begins truly understanding the path it's carving for itself, rooted in a history of cinematic violence, questioning why horror fans find themselves so attracted to stories of violence, and in a world of visual effects and the march of AI, a profound appreciation for hand crafted art.</p><p>It's a good series—but hard to recommend. I'm on board. You might not be.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-senna">Rob Recommends... Senna</h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Streaming on:</strong> Netflix</p><p>I've been watching Netflix's <em>Senna </em>bio-series for <em>Shift+F1's </em>movie podcast, and have been relieved so far that it's actually pretty good. Made with the cooperation (and maybe soft supervision) of his family, <em>Senna </em>is certainly not interested in complicating or subverting the mythology that has surrounded the F1 legend since his death at the Imola circuit in 1994. But neither is its hero-worship as cloying as it could be, and it does a great job of evoking bygone eras of open-wheel racing. At a key moment in lower-tier championship fight that will determine whether he advances into Formula 1, he throws his car's engine into the back of his hatchback and drives all night to a garage in Italy where it was made, begging the master mechanic to tune it so he can remain competitive.</p><p>It's a romantic sequence, but it's one of many that can't help but create a mental juxtaposition between the world of racing of the 70s and 80s—grease-spattered and heavily mechanical—and the modern era that he and his rival Alain Prost helped usher in, one that was increasingly about aerodynamic simulations and advanced electronics and data. <em>Senna </em>does an incredible job of recreating the look of F1 in the 80s, lavishing particular attention of casting and making-up actors to look uncannily like their historical counterparts, but I don't think this is just about superficial authenticity. It draws your attention to how many great and strange characters surrounded the sport, and how many race teams still felt a bit like privateer ships captained by men who were in F1 because they couldn't bear to be anywhere else. F1, like all sports, still has its great characters. But also like all sports, the sharp edges have been sanded down and a liberal coat of corporate sensibilities has been applied.</p><p><em>Senna </em>is too uncomplicated to be a true classic of this genre. It lacks the prickly, hard-nosed sensibilities of <em>Rush</em>, which is probably its nearest inspiration. <em>Ferrari </em>is willing to let its hero be repulsive and magnetic in equal measure. <em>Senna </em>is content to be a strong production of a deeply conventional "great man" sports story. It's a pretty good example of the form, but you can't help but wish the series was a little more willing to examine the complexity of his greatness rather than reassure us about his goodness.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-the-details-of-our-escape">Cado Recommends... <em>The Details of Our Escape</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Possible World Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m a long time fan of tabletop role-playing games, despite having very little time to actually get a group together to play these days. Even so, I still enjoy reading games and turning over their rule sets in my mind, imagining possible worlds that I might someday eventually create and explore with friends. I’m sure I’m not alone in this, and plenty of people reading this might have a similar connection to the hobby. But even if you don’t play or read TTRPGs regularly, I still think you should check out my recommendation for this month: <em>The Details of Our Escape</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.possibleworldsgames.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Possible World Games</u></a> is one of my favorite indie tabletop RPG companies of late. It's helmed by Tyler Crumrine, who both designs his own games, while also publishing and collaborating with other indie designers. For their most recent release, Tyler collaborated with artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/turndecassette/?hl=en&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Linnea Sterte</u></a> and writer/artist <a href="https://www.reneegladman.com/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Renee Gladman</u></a> to create a book that goes beyond being just a rulebook for a very interesting game. Throughout 2022, Sterte and Gladman exchanged works inspired by each other, which then became the basis for the game that Crumrine designed, <a href="https://store.possibleworldsgames.com/product/the-details-of-our-escape?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>The Details of Our Escape</u></em></a>. All three of these elements are collected in this jam packed zine-style book that made my usual casual reading of a game manual so much more rewarding beyond imagining myself playing the game someday.</p><figure></figure><p>Throughout their collaboration, Gladman and Sterte tell a story of a caravan of 2,000 people fleeing an old home looking for a place that might be their next. The narrative and illustrations tease out the ways that a people who might be connected by shared history can still be fractured and collide with each other, as different factions and groups decide to peel off from the caravan, or try to influence the pack in different ways. There’s hints of shared history, a prophecy, and some shadowy threat that all serve to give flavor to the main theme of the work: how people in a society might form community within the group and without. </p><p>Tyler’s game similarly explores this theme by placing the players in charge of one of the groups in the caravan, whose composition you control but whose size is determined by the numbers on a domino you draw from a collective pile. As you play the game, you make a communal path of dominoes that represent the path the caravan has taken, and the different offshoots and diversions individual groups might take. (If you don't own a set of dominoes, don't worry; the game comes with an illustrated set of dominoes you can cut out to play the game with!)</p><p>Overall, the book is a delight to read. Even if you’re not into reading TTRPGs for fun, the included pieces of fiction and illustrations are spectacular and really make it something that any fan of good speculative fiction writing will enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS<em>:</em><em> </em></strong>I <em>also</em> think y’all should check out Conner Fawcett’s (aka, the person behind all of <em>Remap</em>'s branding!) <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/badbucket/the-beasts-and-blessings-of-the-hallowd-hall?ref=remapradio.com"><u>new Kickstarter for an illustrated deck of cards</u></a> full of funny little guys, ghouls, and beasties, with an accompanying compendium with writing from friend of the site Jack de Quidt!</p>

Here’s a look:</p><p>It begins with flashbacks to Superman’s life as Clark Kent, as he bleeds out on the arctic snow only to eventually be rescued by Krypto. We get glimpses of Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan Kent, as well as plenty of slow-motion action shots and some borderline overly sentimental shots; like a kid raising a Superman flag amid a local humanitarian crisis, and an indistinct mob of Metropolis citizens booing and cajoling Superman as he walks into a building. </p><p><em>Superman</em> 2025 won’t just be about the superpowered alien adapting to life on his new home planet, though. It’s also set to include include appearances by Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, who appears for a split second in the trailer with one of the goofiest wigs I’ve ever seen. No idea how writer and director Gunn expects to fit all of that into one movie with a sub-three hour runtime, but here we are.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arrowhead’s CEO and CCO have responded to the community’s backlash against the price of Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped yesterday</a>, launching the title’s first crossover. However, the community isn’t too happy about the collaboration’s prices and has expressed dissatisfaction on social media. Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani and CCO Johan Pilestedt have acknowledged and responded to the community’s sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-killzone-collab-pricing-backlash-pilestedt-on-warbond-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, a user on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1869577821296947219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> pointed out to Pilestedt that he felt the price of Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics was a bit steep, considering this is only half of the collaboration. Pilestedt said he is sorry if the user found the prices high, and the devs are “looking at all the feedback”. Additionally, the CCO revealed that this collaboration would’ve been a Warbond. However, they decided against it as the devs thought “a higher-priced warbond would carry negative sentiment.”</p>



<p>Yesterday, the CEO also took to the game’s official Discord to respond to criticism about Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics prices. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-rip-into-arrowhead-for-straight-up-ridiculous-killzone-crossover-prices-ceo-defends-the-choice-the-more-of-this-we-sell-the-more-illuminate-type-stuff-we-can-keep-dropping-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Jorjani stated, “Hey, quick comment on the Helghast stuff. Firstly, this is our first collaboration, so we’ll figure it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly, it’s optional. The more of this we sell, the more Illuminate-type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p>



<p>Jorjani clarified in a later message that his wording could have been better. He added, “I meant to say that the better the game does, the more stuff we can do. Part of Omens of Tyranny was made by co-development studios that we could not have done unless you fine folks supported us through supercredit purchases.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tango-gameworks-will-still-make-unique-games-after-krafton-purchase.1065333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-unique-games-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has revealed that it's still looking to make "unique and interesting" games following its acquisition by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton earlier this year.</p>

<p>In an interview with Japanese news platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/681/G068145/20241212042/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (with additional reporting and translation by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tango-gameworks-will-continue-to-make-unique-games-after-acquisition-by-krafton-lead-devs-confirm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Tango Gameworks execs Colin Mack, John Johanas, and Kazuaki Egashira discuss their studio's future and its approach to creativity.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">washed its hands</a> of Tango (alongside&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>developer Arkane Austin) earlier this year, leading many to believe that the studio's days were done. However, Krafton then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">swept in</a> to purchase Tango Gameworks, as well as the <i>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</i>IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=8ePluDFi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-chai.jpg?itok=lOX1yOyG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks still wants to make "unique" games after its acquisition by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Egashira confirms that Tango Gameworks' overall goal is "still IP creation", and that rather than making creative decisions, Krafton's part in things is to help Tango "expand".</p>

<p>That appears to be a sentiment echoed by Krafton itself, incidentally. Back in September, CEO Changhan Kim said he didn't think&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">would be a profitable endeavor</a>, but that his company wants to "try something new" and take risks, which is a rather refreshing outlook.</p>

<p>Johanas chips in by saying that he wants Tango to be somewhere people think of games as "their baby" rather than as "some task to be done", and Mack says Tango's goal is to continue to create "unique and interesting games" for the studio's fans.</p>

<p>In short, if you were worried that Krafton would transform Tango into a sequel mill or a DLC producer for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, then it looks like you needn't worry; the goal at the moment appears to be to let the studio retain its unique identity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=_OhRTwgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-evil-within-2-tango-gameworks.jpg?itok=inBCNRJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks also developed both&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, although the studio doesn't own the IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the interview stops short of Tango announcing exactly what it's working on next, although we do know that there are plans to expand&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, so we may well get a sequel announcement in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>For now, though, rest assured that whatever Tango does next, it's likely to come out of leftfield in a similar way to their previous projects. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Insults are so serious, these days. They're all so <em>insulting</em>, whereas the kinds of insult I cherish are the ones that coax a belly laugh from both the instigator of the roast and the roastee. Here are a few stupid putdowns I've made up specially for Xmas, organised into tiers of savagery.</p>

<p>In one of the strangest stories you’ll hear, an NFL owner reportedly made team decisions based on player ratings in EA Sports Madden NFL. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed trades and questioned potential free agent signings due to various ratings in the game. </p>



<p>In one particular instance, Johnson nixed an offseason trade for former Denver Broncos wide receiver (WR) Jerry Jeudy because his Madden rating “wasn’t high enough”. Jeudy ended up being traded to the Cleveland Browns instead. In his first season in Cleveland, he has put up 1,052 receiving yards and four touchdowns.</p>



<p>Another example was Johnson questioning the signing of guard John Simpson. The report states that Johnson didn’t like Simpson’s awareness rating in the game, leading to push back. Luckily for the Jets, General Manager Joe Douglas signed Simpson who has been one of the better players at his position this season.</p>



<p>As far as why Johnson is using Madden ratings to make real-life decisions, it stems from his sons Jack and Brick after they were including in meetings. </p>



<p>“When we’re discussing things, you’ll hear Woody cite something that Brick or Jack read online that’s being weighed equally against whatever opinion someone else in the department has,” an anonymous Jets executive told The Athletic.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, a spokesperson for the Jets declined the claims.  </p>

Alton told Game Developer that he takes no issue with Activision’s actions with Peck, but expressed concern “for my brand as a performer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans of the game have reached out to me because the lack of crediting [of the replacement actor] implies that it may still be me which unfairly represents my abilities as a performer," Alton said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SAG-AFTRA’s dispute with the video game industry revolves around the use of generative AI to replicate voice actor performances.

Thames Valley Police has confirmed it is investigating the robbery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards are surprisingly common, this one has particular weight to it given Ace Grading is a grading company and not just a vendor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These companies receive cards from collectors and grade them out of 10 to add value and authenticity, meaning every card taken wasn't strictly the property of Ace Grading but instead the property of hundreds of card game players and collectors around the country.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those affected have already received an email from Ace Grading, it said, along with instructions on claiming compensation. "We have already determined appropriate compensation amounts, and this will be issued without delay," it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some trading cards do hold incredible value, with price tags of hundreds of dollars fairly common and some rising to thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars. While collectors will receive compensation back, it will likely be no real replacement for the cards themselves which can be incredibly rare and difficult to find replacements for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of increasing value is also a consideration, as grading cards, as mentioned, is a way to ensure their authenticity and increase their value, something that will only go up as time goes on. A card worth $1,000 today may be worth $2,000 in five years, for example, so a cash value replacement for its current value likely won't appease many of those who submitted their cards for grading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ace Grading said it has "implemented additional, robust security measures to further protect [collectors'] property and maintain the integrity of our facility. We take these matters extremely seriously and remain committed to the trust that you have placed in us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading cards have long been the target of thefts given their high value, but high profile sales such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">a Magic: The Gathering Card selling for $3 million</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-wears-most-expensive-pokemon-card-to-wrestlemania">a Pokémon card selling for more than $5 million</a> have seemingly spurred more and more criminals to pursue them in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department noted this increase in 2022</a>, saying it had seen an unprecedented number of crimes targeting Pokémon and other trading cards in the latter half of that year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are myriad high profile examples to point to too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">A gaming store in Minnesota saw $250,000 worth of product stolen</a> after thieves broke through its wall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stolen-gen-con-products-worth-300000-confirmed-to-be-magic-the-gathering-cards">$300,000 worth of Magic: The Gathering cards were stolen</a> from North America's largest board game convention in Indiana, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">a total of 35,000 individual Pokémon cards were stolen</a> from a collectibles store in California.

                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>. Sonic 3 director Jeff Fowler also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-was-dedicated-to-researching-shadow-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3/1100-6527492/" data-ref-id="1100-6527492">Reeves was serious about researching Shadow's character</a> before he took on the role for the movie.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will be out in theaters on Friday, December 20.</p>

                <p>Sony Group has agreed to buy more than 12 million more shares in Elden Ring parent company Kadokawa Corporation, with Sony becoming Kadokawas's largest shareholder. Sony will own 10% of Kadokawa's shares after buying 12,054,100 new shares for about 50 billion yen ($319 million USD).</p><p>Sony Group <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it plans to buy the shares on January 7, 2025. It follows on from Sony's previous acquisition of Kadokawa shares in February 2021.</p><p>Sony and Kadokawa have worked together on a number of projects throughout the years, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors swirled recently </a>that Sony might have been plotting to buy the company outright. That isn't happening, though, at least not at this stage.</p><p>As part of the deal, Sony said it will work together to adapt some of Kadokawa's franchises for global and TV dramas and live-action films, though no specifics projects were announced. Sony will also co-produce Kadokawa anime projects and "further expand" its publishing efforts for Kadokawa's games.</p><p>From Software's Elden Ring is one of Kadokawa's biggest gaming projects, and the series continues in 2025 with the debut of the standalone game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">Elden Ring Nightrein.</a> Beyond gaming, Kadokawa is known for media franchises like Re: Zero and Delicious in Dungeon, among numerous others.</p><p>Sony is also heavily invested in Fortnite studio Epic Games. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">Sony invested more than $1 billion into Epic Games to help create the metaverse</a>, which followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-200-million-more-into-fortnite-developer-epic-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6490077/" data-ref-id="1100-6490077">$200 million investment in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-250-million-into-fortnite-dev-epic-ga/1100-6479536/" data-ref-id="1100-6479536">$250 million in 2020.</a> All up, Sony has invested more than $1.45 billion into Epic Games, which is about 4.5X more than it just agreed to invest into Kadokawa.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1, and it comes with an absolutely astonishing number of fixes for over 1500 of the game's bugs, including changes to the controversial A-Life system and more.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that much like the rest of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, the game's A-Life AI system (that's AI in the trad sense, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/at-least-1000-steam-games-using-generative-ai-per-new-report" rel="nofollow">generative sense</a>) is riddled with bugs, but some of those bugs have been addressed in today's update.</p>

<p>You should now encounter more roaming NPCs in the Zone, and NPCs should no longer spawn behind your back. Additionally, A-Life NPCs should now be visible at greater distances, and groups exploring the Zone should be "more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes".</p>

Other changes have also been implemented, like a reduction in number for Pseudodog clones, which could threaten to overwhelm you in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Rewards for "several missions" have been increased, and "multiple improvements" have been made to characters' facial animations and voice work in "several cutscenes".</p>

<p>You can also look forward (or perhaps that's the wrong phrase) to&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s infinite money glitch being gone from the game. No more can you exploit the Zone's weird logic to make yourself rich. You'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>Since there are almost 2000 fixes in this update, there are far too many for me to list here. Be sure to check out the full&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>update 1.1 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to see everything that's changed.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2007's influential cult classic&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl&nbsp;</em>(which was the spelling being used at the time, and it hasn't been retroactively changed at time of writing).</p>

<p>The game was in development for some time; originally announced in 2010, it went through a lengthy development cycle and at least one development reboot before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">fully re-revealed in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Following that, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to many development setbacks for Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, causing the game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">times</a> before its eventual release earlier this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also on Game Pass (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, anyway). Make sure to take a look at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stalker-2-review" rel="nofollow">our very own Robert N. Adams' review here</a> to find out how things have changed in the Zone over the last 17 years or so.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-will-get-a-simultaneous-worldwide-release-in-2025.1065285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo Entertainment have announced that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, an upcoming remake of 2004 JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, will be getting a worldwide release next year.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, the two studios confirm that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will arrive across the world in fall next year, and that it'll also be coming to PC and PlayStation 5 alongside its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap" rel="nofollow">previously-announced Nintendo Switch release</a>.</p>

<p>At that point, it was named&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, presumably in keeping with the naming convention used by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436670/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky_the_3rd/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third instalment&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>. It looks like Nihon Falcom has abandoned that particular approach, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=3i5GUBww 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-estelle-combat.jpg?itok=jmK-eThI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>is getting a simultaneous global release.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom and GungHo are promising that&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will serve as a "full 3D remake" of the original game, complete with "brand-new localizations, enhanced visuals, and refined gameplay mechanics".</p>

<p>Although it'll have a fresh coat of paint and more,&nbsp;<em>1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>will still tell the same story as the original game, in which protagonists Estelle and Joshua set out to become Bracers (essentially a sort of peacekeeping force).</p>

<p>Along the way, they're caught up in a wider conspiracy that comes with all the usual JRPG trappings; world-saving drama, twists and turns, and plenty of character moments to get you attached to your party.</p>

<p>You can check out the first major trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a sense of what's changed in the kingdom of Liberl since last you visited (or introduce you to it if this is your first time).</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam, as well as PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, in fall 2025. We don't have a more specific release date than that yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED did a veritable press tour for The Witcher IV reveal after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer's debut at The Game Awards 2024</a>. After talking about Ciri as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protagonist</a>, revealing her new voice <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actress</a>, and confirming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwent</a>, the developers stopped by for an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiYBje1qeaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel Skill Up</a>. Here, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba discussed the game's scope, which is said to be similar to The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.</p>
<p><em> I'll give you guys an anecdote first before I answer the question. I remember when we were thinking about how many hours you would need to, let's say, finish The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. When we threw the numbers, we were like, maybe 5 or 10 hours for Heart of Stone and maybe 10 or 15 hours for Blood and Wine, and we ended up with 30 hours. Of course, empirically, we have so much knowledge regarding the structure of The Witcher 1, 2, 3, the structure of Cyberpunk 2077 and all the expansions, so we use this data. But we look at the scale a little differently. We don't want to be servants to the numbers. </em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the map of The Witcher IV is definitely more or less the same when it comes to the size.</em> <em>The amount of quests is also more or less the same, but again, the game is going to be big, but also, the ambition of the entire team is huge. First and foremost, we want to deliver a super compelling experience. So, again, quality over quantity. But definitely, what we can promise is that, yes, this game is going to be pretty big. It's going to be comparable to everything we've done so far, but I cannot tell you if it will be 90%, 85%, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>For the record, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is definitely a huge game. The main story alone can take over 50 hours, and with all the side content, it goes easily above a hundred hours, even if you don't want to complete every single hunt and Easter egg. Still, Kalemba emphasized the studio's focus on quality.</p>
<p>In a not entirely unrelated addendum, the Game Director of The Witcher IV also stressed that this is not the beginning of the game's marketing campaign. It was simply a reveal of the title and the new protagonist. The game entered full production earlier this year, so there's still a long wait ahead for fans - probably a couple of years, if not more.</p>
