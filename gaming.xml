			<p>It’s all too easy to brand any turn-based isometric strategy game where you get sad about your soldiers dying as being an ‘XCOM-like’. Take Crowns Wars: The Black Prince as an example, almost straight away the game was pigeonholed as a medieval XCOM. A suggestion that the game is nothing more than XCOM Enemy Unknown with a hasty reskin and a half-hearted change of environment. Thankfully, Artefacts Studio has been anything but lazy and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crown-wars-the-black-prince">Crowns Wars: The Black Prince</a> is very much its own game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crown Wars | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSqm8DQfGHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set during the Hundred Years’ War – actually 116 years long – Crown Wars casts the player in the role of a feudal lord, desperately trying to survive in the chaotic madness of medieval France. The campaign begins after King Edward III’s successful invasion, in which the King of France was taken prisoner. This power vacuum results in a turbulent kingdom stuffed with rival factions, roving mercenaries, and desperate war bands – the perfect setting for a video game then. Crown Wars loosely follows historical events, but things take a more fictional turn when an evil conspiracy is uncovered that the player must defeat.</p>


<p>The setting of Crowns Wars: The Black Prince is slightly fantastical then, and while it’s not the dragons and giants of high fantasy, you can expect to see cursed English soldiers, alchemists lobbing poison potions, and the occasional fighting bear. All of these over-the-top shenanigans are tempered by regular historical notes and analysis from the developers, the smart integration of which puts other bigger developers and publishers to shame.</p>


<p>The plot, delivered as it is in a series of short cutscenes and text boxes, takes second place to the action strategy on offer. Sure, this is a turn-based game, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it offers a lethargic experience. In contrast to many of its contemporaries, the soldiers, knights, and archers of Crown Wars positively race around the battlefield. Indeed, it comes as a shock when you discover that your Hunter can clear a vast distance, vault a few haystacks, and still have enough movement points left to thwack an unsuspecting mercenary on the bonce.</p>
<p>The speed is what makes the gameplay of Crown Wars so enticing; grand strategies are not conceived with iceberg-like deliberation, but tactics are instead implemented with pace and verve. Attacks can quickly switch from flanking, to feints, and fake-retreats as your small squad of four to six characters dance around a level. For a turn-based game, the dynamism on offer here is intoxicating in its urgency.</p>

<p>This contrasts with the home-screen elements, in which you do up your castle with all those lovely resources you’ve gathered over numerous battles. In return, you’ll unlock new character classes, single use items, and a plethora of weapons and armour. Unlike XCOM, where time is of the element on the campaign map and a playthrough can quickly run away from you, there is no need to rush in Crown Wars. Campaign missions will sit patiently waiting for you, allowing the player to go off and complete skirmishes, raids, and rescues to level up their characters.</p>
<p>As such, expect a certain amount of grinding here, as you have to get your team of fighters up to the required level to take on the next storyline quest. Very un-XCOM-like, but enjoyable in its own way, as investing in your warriors is well worth the time. Indeed, with both avatars and the weapons they use unlocking wonderfully varied abilities, high-level characters can prove unstoppable demons of gory violence.</p>

<p>Controls on the console are decent enough, though occasionally a bit fiddly, but it’s with the player camera that Artefacts Studio is most successful. You can effortlessly zoom in to admire your Paladin’s left butt cheek in all its armour-clad glory, before sweeping upwards to a distant top-down birds-eye view of the entire battlefield with a casual swipe of a thumbstick. The level of camera control is frankly glorious. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said when it’s the enemy’s turn, as the camera fails to show anything you might want to see, regularly missing enemy attacks to show you a church wall or a bit of tree. It’s bizarre that the camera falls apart so spectacularly, and it certainly hampers a player’s ability to identify threats during the enemy turn.</p>
<p>Enemy AI is similarly… interesting, let’s say. Occasionally concocting some bracing strategies, all too often the foes you face are overcome with complete idiocy. When using area of effect attacks they will often friendly fire three of their own warriors to hit only one of yours. They will also expend action points running pointlessly around, leaving them without an attack when they finally get into position.&nbsp;You’ll also have to contend with far too many game crashes – on PS5, at least. Thankfully the auto-save system is robust, so little player progress is lost.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a lot of patching to be done here, particularly to get the challenge to the level that devoted strategy enthusiasts expect. Which is clearly where Crown Wars is aimed, as it makes little attempt to explain its systems to genre newcomers, expecting the player to figure things out through prior strategy-game experience or trial and error. Definitely not one for those new to the genre.</p>

			<p>Developer Moon Studios has released the largest No Rest for the Wicked patch to date, adding support for DLSS and FSR upscaling.</p>
<p>As said, the update is the game's largest early access patch since its PC release last month. Aside from adding support for upscaling, the patch adds the option to remap controllers, the ability to respec your character, a new weapon tryout feature, and plenty of QoL improvements alongside tweaking and visual effect polishing. "Between DLSS and FSR, numerous CPU, GPU performance improvements, and memory optimization we are confident that your experience of playing No Rest For The Wicked will be significantly smoother across a wide range of hardware", Moon Studios writes.</p>
<p>As covered earlier this month, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-holding-back-dlss-fsr-losing-too-much-sharpness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development team was holding back on adding support for upscalers as early testing showed that the game was losing a lot of sharpnes</a>s when using upscaling techniques such as DLSS and FSR. <em>“We have implemented our first version of DLSS for No Rest for the Wicked but we are not going to ship it just yet", Moon Studios boss Gennadiy Korol. "The image quality we are getting is not quite on par with our native rendering, the HDR highlights and rim-lighting is affected more than we would like. We are also losing quite a lot of sharpness. Our TAA and Sharpening looks pretty great with our own upscaling so until DLSS looks on par or better, we would rather bake it a bit more before shipping it."</em></p>
<p>We've included a video showing off highlights from the game's second early access patch below:</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest For The Wicked Patch Notes - Early Access Patch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXQyWvVg_5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the full patch notes are quite extensive, we <a href="https://forum.norestforthewicked.com/t/patch-notes-early-access-patch-2/12039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest reading through them here</a>.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is available for PC via Early Access now. The game's full release is also coming to PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>

        <p>Games firm posts job listing for mobile platform architect</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Sony seems to be building a mobile games platform for free-to-play games.</p>
<p>This is according to tech site <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, which spotted a job listing for a mobile platform architect.</p>
<p>The job description says the company is seeking a software engineer to design a platform "for developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games" which would involve connecting "mobile games to PlayStation services."</p>
<p>Sony currently doesn't have any mobile titles outside of Fate/Grand Order, a turn-based RPG published by Aniplex – a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.</p>
<p>The games firm launched its mobile division in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-acquires-savage-game-studios">acquiring mobile developer Savage Studios</a> as part of its creation which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-owned-savage-game-studios-rebrands-to-neon-koi">has since rebranded as Neon Koi</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation Studios Mobile Division operates separately from the console business, and is focusing on producing mobile titles using new or existing PlayStation IP.</p>
<p>Xbox is also moving more into the mobile space with the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-mobile-store-to-launch-this-summer">launch of its own storefront this July.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-wants-to-become-the-next-fromsoftware-or-blizzard/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-wants-to-become-the-next-fromsoftware-or-blizzard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has released the biggest hit of 2024 (alongside Palworld), surpassing everyone's expectations with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million units sold in 12 weeks</a>, which makes the game the fastest-selling Sony exclusive ever.</p>
<p>Now, the independent developer has made some changes to its leadership. CEO Johan Pilestedt has nominated Shams Jorjani in his former role so he can focus on game-making as Chief Creative Officer and Chairman of the company.</p>
<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with GamesIndustry</a>, Johan Pilestedt shared the ambitious goals of the Helldivers 2 team:</p>
<p><em>We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make. The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more. We pride ourselves on being an independent studio. We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard.</em></p>
<p>Lofty targets indeed, but Helldivers 2 certainly is a great platform to build upon. Of course, there are many ongoing issues with the live game, although Pilestedt is confident they will be ironed out.</p>
<p><em>This is something the organisation has seen before. We had the horrible launch of Magicka, which was really buggy, and me and Shams recognised that we had to interact with the community, talk to them in an honest way, and tell them what’s going on as much as we could. And then take action immediately to resolve the issues. So we’ve seen and been through it before, albeit at a much smaller scale. It is higher stakes this time.</em></p>
<p><em>When we look at the challenge ahead of us, we feel like Frodo and Sam going towards Mordor. The oblivious approach of ‘we’ll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come’. The strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other. We know that whatever we’re going through, we’re there for each other and we will be able to take on any challenge, almost, and come out stronger on the other side.</em></p>
<p>For now, Helldivers 2 is so popular a recent rumor even suggested Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-might-be-pondering-an-helldivers-2-xbox-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might consider launching an Xbox port</a>. We'll see if that pans out or not.</p>

<p data-characters="376" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The long-awaited <em>Wuthering Waves</em> was finally released on May 23, but some players are having trouble downloading, updating, and playing the new gacha game. If your download for <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is stuck at 99.99%, don’t worry: you’re not alone. Here’s how you can fix your download and finish installing if <em>Wuthering Waves</em> gets stuck at 99.99% while updating.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-fix-wuthering-waves-stuck-at-99-99" data-injectable="false">How to fix <em>Wuthering Waves</em> stuck at 99.99%</h2> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="870" data-injectable="true">You can fix your <em>Wuthering Waves</em> download getting stuck at 99.99% by <strong>waiting for about 15 minutes</strong>. If you are downloading <em>Wuthering Waves</em> onto an HDD rather than an SSD, it’s even possible it takes a little longer. Even though the launcher doesn’t update its status text, most of the time when players are getting stuck at 99.99% it’s actually the period of time in which <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is verifying your game files and initializing, not actually downloading any more files. This is why a slower HDD can lead to this process taking longer than an SSD.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">However, even after waiting, some players have still been stuck at 99.99% which can mean that the process was interrupted in some way. Thankfully, we have found a fix for that situation as well. Here’s everything you can do to fix your download if <em>Wuthering Waves</em> gets stuck at 99.99%:</p> <ol data-found-items="7" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"> <li>First, <strong>wait and let the launcher do its thing for about 15 or so minutes</strong>. It can take this long to fully verify your files, and even a little longer if you are on an HDD.</li> <li>If you’ve waited and it’s still stuck at 99.99%, <strong>your install has probably stalled</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Close the Launcher completely and restart it</strong>. After a few minutes, it should pick up where you left it, meaning you may be at 99.99% again.</li> <li><strong>Wait another 15 minutes or so</strong>. If it’s still not completed, close the launcher again.</li> <li>Navigate to the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> install folder at C:\Wuthering Waves\ and <strong>delete this entire root folder</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Reinstall <em>Wuthering Waves</em> from scratch <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the installer</a>.</strong></li> <li>Proceed with <strong>updating again through the Launcher</strong>.</li> </ol>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Even though this is a tedious process, it seems to be the only way to ensure you can fix the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> downloading and updating getting stuck at 99.99%. If you have an SSD, it’s recommended that you download and install <em>Wuthering Waves</em> onto it rather than an HDD as it doesn’t seem to have the problem.</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 4 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to find a way to get to the creepy Twilight Town, which requires a few steps, including figuring out one of the more obtuse secrets in the game. But hey, don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd31.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>According to good ol' Professor Frankly, the pipe to Twilight Town is somewhere under Rogueport’s West Side.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd32.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But how do you get beneath the west side? The key is to slip through the cracks in this grate.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd33.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll drop down to the underground. Now, use the Yoshi kid to hover jump over the gap to the left, then go through the door.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd34.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll find a weird brown pipe, which you can’t get through. Hmmm!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd35.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to Professor Frankly and talk to him about it. He’ll tell you about seeing somebody from Twilight Town in the area. The key is this seemingly innocuous wall next to Merlon’s shop. There’s actually an optical illusion here which hides a secret back alley. Just walk into the middle of the wall, then go to the right or left to slip through.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd36.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You’ll find the Twilight Town resident Darkly in the back alley. Talk to him and he’ll set you up so you can get through the pipe to his hometown. Head back to that weird brown pipe and you can now pass through.</p>
<p>And there you have it – off to Twilight Town for you. Have a spooky good time!</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 3 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to get yourself a blimp ticket to the floating island of Glitzville, but doing so is a little more complicated than getting to where you need to go for Chapter 1 or 2. This may well be one of your first real “What am I supposed to do?” stumbling blocks in the game, but don’t worry, we have you covered…</p>
<p><em>Note: The following guide contains minor Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door SPOILERS.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>According to Professor Frankly, you’ll need to talk to Don Pianta on the west side of town to get your hands on a blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, to start, let’s make sure you have access to the west side. There’s a yellow toad blocking your way to the west side, who accuses you of crushing their contact lens. Go to the nearby shop to buy them a new one (talk to the shopkeeper to do so). The shopkeeper will send away for lens and ask you to wait and… you have to do just that. After about five minutes, they’ll send you a mail saying the lens has come in. Yeah, it’s weird, but that’s how it is. Give the contact lens to the toad and you can now access the west side.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, slightly unintuitively, it order to further your quest in the west side of town, you’ll have to return to the east side of town. If you haven’t already, defeat or pay off the guard, then squeeze through this crack next to the Trouble Center.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd26.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you emerge from the crack, head through the door to your right. Talk to the gang member Ishnail (the guy with the snail shell). Pay him 64 coins and he’ll tell you to go to the shop on the far west side of town and buy a Dried Shroom and Dizzy Dial in order, then say your favorite color is yellow. By the way, you can actually skip paying Ishnail now that I’ve told you the secret “password.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, head to the west end, past the Pianta Parlor, to the shop owned by the ghost with cat ears, Peeka. As previously instructed, buy the Dried Shroom, Dizzy Dial, then tell the ghost your favorite color is yellow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can then pass through the shop and up the stairs to Don Pianta’s office. He’ll ask you to find his daughter who has eloped with her boyfriend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>You can find them down by the docks. Return to Don Pianta after speaking to them (the dialogue choices don’t matter) and he’ll give you the blimp ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd30.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Finally, head north up the central path in Rogueport’s west end and give your ticket to the cheep-cheep.</p>
<p>And there you go – all aboard to Glitzville! Get ready for a fun wrestling-themed chapter!</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guide-how-to-level-up-party-members/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>Unlike most recent entries in the series, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is a full-on RPG, with Mario gaining levels in a straightforward manner by earning Star Point XP by winning battles, but what about your various non-Mario party members? How do you improve their abilities? It isn’t immediately obvious and the game doesn’t do a great job of explaining it, but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd19.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The key to upgrading your support party members is collecting Shine Sprites, collectibles that look like the Shines from Super Mario Sunshine. These are 42 of these in total, spread around the world – usually slightly off the main path, with players often having to use one of their papery powers in order to collect them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd20.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you’ve acquired some of these Shine Sprites, head back to the east side of Rogueport off the main plaza. You’re going to want to go into Merlon the fortune teller’s place – you can tell it by the Shine Sprite symbol outside the door. Trade in three Shine Sprites in order to upgrade your party member. This will increase their HP and give them a new ability.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Each party member can be upgraded twice, but you can only upgrade them the second time after you’ve completed Chapter 5. At that point, you’ll notice Merlon standing outside his shop. He’ll ask you to find the “Up Arrow” item in Hooktail Castle. Head to the easternmost room in Hooktail Castle with the spikes, and use Captain Bobbery to blow up a cracked wall and collect the Up Arrow from a chest.

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>The new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door features a revamped, more richly-orchestrated soundtrack, but perhaps you prefer the Gamecube original’s more funky lo-fi sound? Well, worry not, you can switch between the two, but don’t go looking for a toggle in the options menu. No, that would be too easy, and Nintendo doesn’t like to make things easy. You’re going to need to get a specific badge to change the music, so here’s how to do that…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you arrive in Rogueport at the beginning of the game, head to the main plaza and then the inn. Head up to the second floor of the inn, then go through the door on the lefthand side of the room. This will take you over a small bridge to the semi-hidden “Lovely Howz of Badges.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unlike in the original TTYD, you can now buy a “Nostalgic Tunes” badge for 1 coin. It’s the one that looks like a little Gamecube, naturally.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd17.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This badge doesn’t require any Badge Points to equip, so you can freely equip or un-equip it to change between the old and new soundtrack without having to worry about your BP limit.</p>
<p>And there you go – the choice of tunes is now yours! I like most of the new tracks, but some of the classics still stand up better, so I actually change back and forth fairly often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/guides/24161181/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-great-boggly-tree-walkthrough-punies-ttyd-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CxPbQQ"><strong>Chapter 2</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924972"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a> focuses on the <strong>Punies </strong>and the <strong>Great Boggly Tree</strong>. While the forest outside the tree is straightforward, the tree itself is labyrinthine, filled with twists and turns.</p>
<p id="1DEnxB">You’ll have to rescue the Punies, who end up following you around, eager to help solve the mysteries of the tree.</p>
<p id="nFgyFT">The Great Boggly Tree can be a nightmare to navigate in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, so we have a walkthrough for you, including how to find all six <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924922">Star Pieces</a> and four <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23925646">Shine Sprites</a>.</p>
<hr id="wIgrIp">

<p id="w9BpPF">Once you’re inside the tree, take out the X-Nauts and listen to Punio’s conversation with his friends. The other Punies have been kidnapped, and you can’t really progress much through the tree without them, so your first task is going to be to free them.</p>
<p id="Jl706V">Ignore the red door on the right and head into the warp pipe, which will take you up to the second floor. There’s an interesting structure with a star-shaped cutout in the back, but we’ll be back for that later. Keep its location in mind and head up the warp pipe to the third floor.</p>
<p id="kbC3TS">Smoosh the bushes in this room to find a <strong>Power Punch</strong> item. Head up another floor and then <em>another</em> floor to see the jailed Punies in a red and blue cage. Head to the left and you’ll run into Ms. Mouz in a treasure room, where you can grab some loot. Take out the X-Naut inside who drops a <strong>red key</strong>, collect the <strong>Ultra Mushroom</strong>, and then head back to the cages to free the elder Puni. Follow him to the <strong>first room of the tree</strong>.</p>

<p id="0X18L2">The elder Puni will give you the <strong>Puni Orb</strong> and 11 Punies will start following you around, attracted to the orb. Note that Punies will not follow you if you jump off a ledge, but they can fall down ledges when scared or blown away by Flurrie. They will follow you up and down the pipes, though. If you lose any of your Punies, you can also go back to the first room and talk to the elder to get them back.</p>
<p id="OVijfY">Head back up to the second floor and put the Puni Orb in the star-shaped cutout structure you passed earlier. A pipe will appear, leading you down the tree, so grab the Puni Orb out of the indent, and then head inside. Take out the X-Naut and interact with the console next to the red door to have permanent easy access to the first room of the tree.</p>
<p id="UpAjri">Take the warp pipe down and smash the bushes to get a<strong> Thunder Rage</strong> item. There’s also a <strong>Shine Sprite</strong> on the right side of the room.</p>
<p id="xO3UZw">Head back up and place the Puni Orb into this indent to get all the Punies to line up. Then use <strong>Flurrie’s wind ability</strong> to blow them off the platform to the right and into the water below. Keep blowing with Flurrie and the Punies will get swept to the right side of the room. Jump across the platform to the right side and enter the pipe with your Punies.</p>

<p id="SP0jkk">Follow the path and your Punies will get scared by a <strong>Pider</strong>, which you’ll need to be wary of as you traverse the tree. Your Punies may run off the cliff, but don’t worry about them. Beat the Pider and then use Flurrie’s wind ability to move a boulder off of the plane platform. Glide down to the right and land on another plane platform and then glide down to the left to get a second <strong>Shine Sprite</strong>.</p>
<p id="UkSqsp">If any of your Punies were left upstairs when you flew down, there’s a pipe behind where you grabbed Shine Sprite that you can use to pick them up. Head back down and head into the warp pipe in the back right corner.</p>
<p id="oydhXf">In this zigzag room, Piders will drop down, scaring your Punies off the platform, but don’t worry about it. Use Koops’ shell to hit an invisible block under the question mark block to get a <strong>Damage Dodge P badge</strong>.</p>

<p id="TbpXy6">Drop off the platform to get to a room with a save block in it. Hit the bushes nearby to get a <strong>Star Piece</strong> and use Flurrie’s wind ability on the left wall to get to a <strong>secret shop</strong>. Buy stuff (if you want), and then head back out.</p>
<p id="dIwSDR">With your Punies back, head back up to the zigzag platform, and then go to the room to the right. Let your Punies engage in battle with the Jabbies and head into the newly opened room to get the<strong> blue key</strong> from a chest. You know what to do: Head back up all the warp pipes until you hit the jail cell room and free the remaining Punies. You should have 101 of them now!</p>
<p id="1yNXHY">Make your way back to the zigzag room and follow the path with your 101 Punies to enter the left doorway. Again, your Punies will take on a massive hoard of Jabbies, but you’ll need to help them a bit. <strong>Use Flurrie’s wind ability</strong> to assure their victory against the Jabbies, and then enter the newly opened doorway.</p>
<p id="tTa1M5">Head down the pipe, ignoring the Puni structure. In the room with the big stump in the middle, walk behind the pipe to get a <strong>Star Piece</strong>. Go into the next room and use the Puni Orb on the 101 Puni structure — only for it to be a trap.</p>
<p id="kbucOE">Luckily, you can wiggle out of the cage through the bars using ZR. Head into the warp pipe on the right and memorize the symbols you see down there: <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>moon</strong>, <strong>Puni</strong>, and <strong>star</strong>. Hit the black exclamation point block. Before you leave, grab a <strong>Star Piece</strong> from behind the pipe.</p>

<p id="6kMRv3">Backtrack to the zigzag room again and head into the room on the right  where you fought the Jabbies. Keep heading right back into the room where you found the blue key. Hit the newly-appeared switches until the pillars in the back match the ones you saw before. (If you need a reminder, from left to right, it’s: <strong>sun</strong>, <strong>moon</strong>, <strong>Puni</strong>, and <strong>star</strong>.)</p>
<p id="YIcKJc">The pillars will vanish and you can head into a back room now to get the <strong>Super Boots</strong>, beefing up your jump damage and allowing you to <strong>Spin Jump</strong>!</p>
<p id="7pnkMY">Head back out and Spin Jump on the wooden platform to drop down to an area with lots of pillars. Fire Koops’ off to the left to nab a <strong>Charge badge</strong>. Jump to the back platforms to get a <strong>Shine Sprite</strong>. Head back up once you have your loot and go to the zigzag room again.</p>
<p id="270AIO">Go to the left room and use your new Spin Jump ability on the wooden panel on the floor to land on the big stump.</p>

<p id="wgGTBr">Ignore the pipe on top of the stump for now, and head to the right to reach the room that the Punies are trapped in. Spin Jump on the wooden platform inside the cage and put the Puni Orb in place on the structure. Use Flurrie’s breath to push the Punies into the hole to freedom. Head down to pick them up and then take them to the warp pipe on the giant stump.</p>
<p id="GAXxTh">Drop down the pipes repeatedly until you get to a room filled with water. Go down another floor, cross the platforms, and take the pipe back up. (Ignore the Shine Sprite for now.)</p>
<p id="eWuzO4"><strong>Use Koops to hit the blue switch</strong>, draining the water. In the now-drained area, there’s a <strong>Dizzy Dial </strong>behind the stairs and a <strong>Shrink Stomp badge</strong> in the treasure chest. Head back to the floor below and use the lily pads to reach the <strong>Shine Sprite</strong>.</p>

<p id="saUcbI">Go into the pipe next to where the Shine Sprite was and use the 101 Puni device to open another hole in the ground. Drop in to get into a room with a save block. Head to the right room. Put the Puni Orb in the indent for the boss to emerge. You’ll have to escape the tree in a set amount of time, but don’t worry – it’s more than enough time to get out of the tree.</p>
<p id="tjuoMD">Head up the pipe on the right. Take out the X-Naut, but before you leave this room, smush down the bushes for a <strong>Star Piece</strong>. Use the console to open the red door, and head up the pipes until you get to the room where you had to push the Punies into the bubbles. Cross the platform and enter the red door for a <strong>boss fight</strong> against <strong>Magnus Von Grapple</strong>.</p>
<p id="tGLw07">Magnus has<strong> 30 HP</strong> and isn’t really any different from the other enemies you’ve encountered. Its hands will detach, and you can one-shot its hands as long as you execute your attacks correctly.</p>
<p id="puC1c5">Once you’re done with the boss, you’ll get the<strong> Crystal Star</strong> and you’ll be done with the Great Boggly Tree!</p>
<p id="zlH7Hb">There are two Star Pieces you can backtrack in the tree if you want, now that you have the Spin Jump:</p>
<ul>
<li id="5AbTyZ">Go back to the room where you pushed the Punies into the bubbles. Go up the pipe on the left and Spin Jump next to the pipe that’s going up to get a Star Piece.</li>
<li id="F6AVFP">Go up to the room with the red and blue jail cells and Spin Jump in the blue cell for a Star Piece.</li>
</ul>

  <p id="RQJJDI"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> has been remade for the Nintendo Switch, and while there are a few changes, it’s mostly the same game, with a beautiful new coat of paint.</p>
<p id="EsBhe3">If you’re new to the world of Mario RPGs or maybe you remember playing the original game 20 years ago (yeesh!), then we have a handful of tips that are helpful for starting the remake.</p>
<p id="PqVaiQ">Below, we list a few tips to make sure you have an easy time starting out in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>.</p>
<hr id="FtE7Ss">
<h2 id="dpp9ip"><strong>Don’t forget to pick up enemy drops</strong></h2>
<p id="Hlpobo">After you beat an enemy, you don’t automatically collect the items from the enemy. Rather, the items will just explode onto the floor where the enemy was. Make sure to actually pick up the coins and items before you skitter off to your next fight.</p>

<h2 id="9utyww"><strong>Investigate everything</strong></h2>
<p id="1YlHBh">Since the game is made of, well, paper, that means most of the décor and environment is flat. There might be a Star Piece or badge behind those paper-thin barrels or that bush in the foreground. You should also smush every bush with your hammer to find items, coins, and other useful things.</p>
<h2 id="1s41Nq"><strong>Don’t dwell too much on seemingly secret paths</strong></h2>
<p id="6NtNzK">See a dog-eared paper covering something but you can’t grab it? Or maybe you see a huge crack in the wall but you hammer isn’t strong enough to smash it down? Don’t dwell on these and come back later. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock more party members and more abilities that will take care of these things easy-peasy, so don’t bother trying to grab that loose paper now.</p>
<h2 id="b1Nyy6"><strong>Take advantage of letting your partner go first</strong></h2>
<p id="iH8Rdg">While you can control which enemy Mario and his friends jump on, some attacks (like Mario’s hammer or Koops’ shell) can only attack the first monster on the left. That being said, you’ll want to strategize who gets to attack first when you’re against a variety of enemies. Maybe Koops can kill the first enemy with his shell, but he won’t be able to reach the second enemy, who flies and thus dodges his shell — it’s in cases like this where you’ll want to do a little switcheroo.</p>

<h2 id="xu9xdP"><strong>Watch your item count</strong></h2>
<p id="je3sQo">You can only hold a few items at a time and if you try to pick up an extra item, you’ll need to drop or use one of your items to get it. You can deposit extra items in storage via shopkeepers, so make sure to drop off any extra mushrooms or inn tickets that are cluttering your inventory.</p>
<h2 id="S598hE"><strong>Pay attention to that dialogue — or don’t and hear out Goombella</strong></h2>
<p id="Bw0thg">If you caught yourself dozing off and spamming the A button during one of Professor Frankly’s spiels, don’t worry. Goombella will provide hints on who to talk to or where to go next, if you press ZL.</p>
<p id="eEpoM9">While Professor Frankly will typically give you an assist on how to get to the next areas, sometimes impatience gets the best of us. It happens.</p>
<h2 id="ZTcaKj"><strong>Try everything everywhere</strong></h2>
<p id="NVJmco">If you’re stuck in a dungeon in what seems to be a dead end, try <em>everything.</em> Use Flurrie’s wind on everything, try pushing objects around, and hammer everything in the room. Some things, like the aforementioned peeling paper walls and huge Xs on the floor, are more obvious hints as to what to do, but not everything is as simple as it may seem.</p>

  <p id="eWDcSq">As you cross through Petalburg to head to Hooktail Castle in the Nintendo Switch remake of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23924972"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, you’ll eventually run into the <strong>Quiz Thwomp</strong>, who has a plethora of questions for you. There’s also a second Thwomp in Chapter 7 in the X-Naut Fortress.</p>
<p id="r0zXb3">While none of the questions are particularly difficult, some of these answers can be pretty easy to miss if you haven’t been paying too much attention to the story or the stuff around you. The quiz is actually a tiny bit different from the original GameCube quiz, so don’t just answer all willy-nilly.</p>
<p id="y48EXG">Below, we’ve detailed <strong>all Thwomp quiz answers in </strong><em><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></em>.</p>
<hr id="7IgoyM">

<p id="KBtJU0">The questions and correct answers for the Quiz Thwomp are as follows, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="XD9jbP">“What’s hidden in Shhwonk Fortress?”<br><strong>Sun and Moon Stones</strong>.</li>
<li id="HoVcDh">“What do one Mushroom and one Fire Flower cost at the shop in Petalburg? Total!”<br><strong>12 Coins</strong>.</li>
<li id="mF8FpE">“What is the name of the mayor of Petalburg?”<br><strong>Kroop</strong>.</li>
<li id="Z2XBmu">“Tell me, now! Where is the Crystal Star?”<br><strong>Hooktail Castle</strong>.</li>
<li id="QnHc7Y">“How can one get from Rogueport to Petal Meadows?”<br><strong>Go through a Pipe</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p id="FpqcQy">Once you answer him correctly, you’ll be all set to continue on and find the Sun and Moon Stones.</p>

<p id="8FWNxa">You’ll have to do another Thwomp quiz once you eventually get to the X-Naut base in Chapter 7. This robo-Thwomp has some tougher questions, but have no fear, we have the answers.</p>
<p id="Z6yMHV">This time the Thwomp will also ask if you’re sure about every answer you submit. The questions and correct answers for the second Quiz Thwomp are as follows, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="hskIpa">“Exactly what’s hidden here?”<br><strong>Elevator key</strong>
</li>
<li id="fkiz54">“What’s the name of the girl in Petalburg who’s waiting patiently for Koops’ return?”<br><strong>Koopie Koo</strong>
</li>
<li id="CDSaLV">“Goomba, Lava Bubble, Buzzy Beetle, and Boo. How many feet do they have? Total!”<br><strong>6 feet</strong>
</li>
<li id="Z43ipW">“Where was the one, the only, Diamond Star?”<br><strong>Hooktail’s belly</strong>
</li>
<li id="rDYTm1">“What was the name of the very first champion of the Glitz Pit?”<br><strong>Prince Mush</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="rvh7kf">After a suspenseful moment, the Thwomp will give you the elevator key and you can move on in the X-Nauts base.</p>

Players take on the role of the tree’s caretaker, controlling familiars (golems) and turning the tree into a fortified mobile fortress as they progress on their journey.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Game System</strong></p><p>First, gather resources on the ground. Collect not only materials for construction but also food to satisfy your golems’ hunger, as well as “lost technology” left behind by the past inhabitants of this world.</p><p>You can build various structures on the back of the sapling. Depending on your strategy, you can construct walls to protect its core, weapons to defeat monsters, and rooms for golems to work in.</p><p>However, if you cannot effectively manage your time, resources, the stamina of your golems, and the weight and strength of buildings, the journey to the nursery bed will be a challenging one.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884225"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Once you’re prepared, embark on your journey. The World Tree sapling will take the form of a large beast and begin moving.</p><p>During the journey, monsters attracted to the World Tree’s vitality will attack relentlessly. These monsters will destroy buildings and target the World Tree’s core. Use your golems and weapons to fend off the monsters’ attacks.</p><p><strong>Demo Available During Steam Next Fest: June 2024 Edition</strong></p><p>To coincide with the Next Fest event on Steam, which runs from Monday, June 10, 2024, to Monday, June 17, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT, a demo version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available starting Thursday, May 30, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. PT.</p><p>The demo offers a comprehensive look at the beginning of the journey with almost no restrictions on in-game content.</p><p><strong>Early Access Version Launches July 9</strong></p><p>The Early Access version of <em>Ark of Charon</em> will be available on Steam starting Tuesday, July 9, 2024.</p><p>Get early access to the game at a discounted price before the full release.

Starting with Season 11, the Hero Mastery Gauntlet, a round-based tower defense mode that sees players team up against robots, will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Hero Mastery Solo Courses will remain available as a single-player offering, with more courses promised to arrive in future seasons. You can see the full statement below:</p><p>Hero Mastery Gauntlet launched in March 2024, meaning it will have only been available for around three months before it’s dropped. Although the mode has been criticized by many, some are disappointed not only because it’s leaving so soon, but because it represents another scrapped PvE mode in the history of Overwatch 2.</p><p>In May 2023, Blizzard announced it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>no longer be adding the long-promised PvE Hero mode</u></a> to Overwatch 2. It had been touted as one of the biggest changes for the franchise, which was largely known for its PvP content, since Overwatch 2 was originally announced. Director <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-director-pve-hero-mode"><u>Aaron Keller eventually apologized for the change of course</u></a>, calling the mode an “exciting but gargantuan vision.”</p><p>Overwatch 2 launched in 2022 as a sequel to Blizzard’s original hero shooter. While we enjoyed it upon its release, giving it an 8/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review"><u>our review</u></a>, the hero shooter follow-up has changed in a few major ways in the last few years.</p><p>Following the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-league-officially-ending-as-blizzard-focuses-on-new-direction"><u>decision to shutter the Overwatch League</u></a> late last year, Blizzard announced that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-actively-working-to-let-all-overwatch-2-players-experience-a-hero-the-day-a-season-drops"><u>make new heroes available to all players to enjoy</u></a> instead of locking them behind a premium battle pass purchase. The company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-10-will-unlock-all-heroes-and-change-how-mythic-skins-are-earned"><u>made good on that promise with Season 10</u></a>, delivering all past playable characters and its newest Damage hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-venture-gameplay-trailer-trial"><u>Venture</u></a>, available to all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The current season runs for another 28 days, meaning you have just less than one month to squeeze out that last bit of fun from Hero Mastery Gauntlet before the co-op mode is gone for good.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has a pretty big map, and in the traditional style for this type of game, a lot of it will be dark when you first start playing. The good news is that it will be covered with structures known as a Resonance Nexus to help you out.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The Resonance Nexus is an easy way for you to get additional map information and get a vision of everything you might be missing. It might not sound like much, but it can be very useful in the early game and cut down on a lot of confusion just to understand how this mechanic works. Keep in mind that you can be in an area covered by a Resonance Nexus, and if you don’t have the device activated, the map will stay dark.</p>
 <h2 id="h-all-resonance-nexus-locations-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">All Resonance Nexus Locations in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Interactive Map</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">There will be a total of 11 Resonance Nexus to find when you first start playing Wuthering Waves. These are, essentially, giant server farms that you can visit to download map data about the surrounding area. Each time you find one and interact with it, it will give you the data you seek, and a large portion of the map will become visible. They are also extremely useful as fast travel points and allow you to heal any damage you have taken or revive fallen characters in your party. </p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false">You can find the Resonance Nexus in the following locations, as shown on the map above:</p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"> <li>At Whining Aix’s Mire</li> <li>To the northeast of Whinig Aix’s Mire, on the coast</li> <li>To the southwest of the Dim Forest, on the coast</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw, in the northwest of the area</li> <li>To the southwest of Wuming Bay</li> <li>To the west of Tiger Maw, halfway to the Port City of Guixu</li> <li>Jinzhou, almost directly in the center of the city</li> <li>Far to the east of Jinzhou, on the islands</li> <li>North of the Gorges of Spirits</li> <li>North of the Central Plains</li> <li>South of Desorock Highland</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">These are not the only fast travel points in the game, as you can also access a huge number of Resonance Beacons while you travel the map. There are 68 of the Beacons in total, so they are far more prevalent, but they do not give you the ability to cure wounds or revive fallen characters in the same way that visiting a Nexus does.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="false">Now, when you go and activate all the Resonance Nexus points is up to you, but I traditionally find it very useful just to do this as early as possible. Being able to fast travel to almost anywhere based on the quests, side questions, or just general random stuff that comes my way in a game like this is always useful. If I suddenly need to be halfway across the map to farm some ascension/development materials for a character, I would like to be able to just do it. So, 30 minutes or so spent running around the map early in the game can be a real time saver.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-and-leaked-image-very-clearly-point-to-black-ops-6.878868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We’ve been getting numerous hints recently that the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s Call of Duty</a>, rumored to be a Treyarch-developed continuation of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Ops series set during the Gulf War</a>, is likely not far away, and few more bits of information dropped today back that up.</p>
<p>First up, the reliable Call of Duty experts at <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Intel</a> revealed the <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existence of a website</a> featuring what appears to be a teaser for the next Call of Duty (how Charlie Intel found said website is a bit unclear – I have a feeling Activision themselves may have given them a “tip.”) You can check out one of the live-action teasers found on the site below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BREAKING: The first Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser is here 👀</p>
<p>New website found: <a href="https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur">https://t.co/8B9C5QIKur</a> <a href="https://t.co/JcW4mhTHDh">pic.twitter.com/JcW4mhTHDh</a></p>
<p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the video shows some group making a statement by putting blindfolds reading “The Truth Lies” on the Presidential noggins of Mount Rushmore. Another teaser on the site shows the same group putting up posters featuring an image of the blindfolded Mt. Rushmore. Of note, one of the blindfolds features a wolf-like logo that looks very much like the one Microsoft used to tease a “Direct” that will be broadcast directly after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>. It’s widely expected this Direct will be focused on the next Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reliable insider account <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billbil-kun</a> has leaked a image of what appears to be Call of Duty 2024’s key art. The image has been intentionally blurred by the leaker, but we can still glean something from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">🔒 REDACTED 🔒</p>
<p>Call of Duty $S7&amp;5°+/45%86 <a href="https://t.co/02AACE67Io">pic.twitter.com/02AACE67Io</a></p>
<p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1793344752768704797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we can’t make it out perfectly, the blurred character above seems to be posing in a very similar way to the key art for the original Call of Duty: Black Ops and numerous games in the series since. The orange and gray color scheme also screams Black Ops.</p>
<p>So yeah, pretty much everything is yelling that this year’s game will be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, or perhaps to follow the naming convention of the last game in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops Gulf War.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase and Call of Duty reveal will take place on June 9, so mark your calendars. What do you think? Getting excited for what Treyarch is cooking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NDfSx0">Continuity in the Mad Max movie series is pretty confusing. It might be hard to believe, but the 40-year-old franchise spawned from a micro-budget Australian movie about raiders in a post-apocalyptic wasteland doesn’t actually have the most coherent timeline. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, the full-speed-ahead latest film in the series, doesn’t clear anything up, although it does have a specific timeline connection to its predecessor, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. But we’ll do our best to help you understand it.</p>
<p id="4jaX4s">The first important thing to remember about <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/93Nq0">Mad Max’s timeline</a> is that it kind-of-sort-of got rebooted. <em>Fury Road</em>, the fourth installment in the series, was originally planned for production in the ’90s or early 2000s, with Mel Gibson returning to his central role as roving loner Max . However, after numerous delays, and numerous instances of Mel Gibson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mel-gibson-controversies-timeline-antisemitism-dui-2023-10">being a horrible person in public</a>, the movie got an updated script and a new Max — the much younger Tom Hardy. </p>

<p id="QCq9cr">With the change in actors and in Max’s apparent age, the series had to be changed slightly, too. So <em>Fury Road</em> is essentially set in an alternate timeline from the original movies, where key events happen at slightly different times. In <em>Fury Road</em>’s timeline, the nuclear annihilation of huge portions of humanity happened between the events of <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>The Road Warrior</em>, rather than after <em>The Road Warrior,</em> like they do in the original trilogy. </p>
<p id="JQAwrQ">This feels especially confusing given that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23981365/furiosa-mad-max-trailer-fury-road-anya-taylor-joy-hemsworth-george-miller"><em>Furiosa</em>’s first trailer</a> says the movie takes place 45 years after “the Collapse.” Technically, this means the movie probably takes place a little less than 45 years after the events of <em>The Road Warrior</em>. This doesn’t make a ton of sense when compared to the events of <em>Fury Road</em>, especially if it’s the same Max character.</p>

<p id="j2gvy1">But if you’re trying to square that math either with the events of the original Mad Max trilogy or with <em>Fury Road</em>, let me offer some helpful advice: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23180299/obi-wan-kenobi-show-age-fictional-character-played-by-actors#:~:text=Why%20does%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,character%20played%20by%20different%20people.&amp;text=You%20see%2C%20Obi%2DWan%20Kenobi,and%20he%20died%20in%202000.">Don’t.</a> It probably doesn’t make sense. In fact, the <a href="https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/mad-max-fury-road-2015/mad-max-fury-road">comic books that came out since <em>Fury Road</em></a> tried to fit its timeline back into the original trilogy, and never got close to succeeding. </p>
<p id="2UGcIQ">And you know what? That’s OK.</p>
<p id="sEzkuu"><em>Mad Max</em> director, writer, and creator George Miller, in his infinite wisdom, rightly decided with the release of <em>Fury Road</em> that maybe Max is an idea larger than petty grievances like canon and continuity. Max is a myth and a legend, and as Miller himself said, anything that happens to him is just “an episode” in a tumultuous life, with no specific connection needed. As he put it in a press conference for <em>Fury Road</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="cpT7Tl">All the films have no strict chronology. It’s probably after Thunderdome, but it’s an episode in the life of Max and this world. It’s basically an episode, and it’s us revisiting that world. I never wrote the story, <em>any </em>of the stories, with a chronological connection.</p></blockquote>
<p id="BZWqWN"><em>Furiosa</em> is no different, and that first trailer said as much in its first few seconds. This is her <em>Odyssey</em>. She’s destined to become a myth, and myths are too important to worry about exactly how the details line up. We know this is a prequel because it deals with her childhood and young adulthood; we know it spans 15 years of her life because she tells us in the movie itself that 15 years have passed since we first saw her on screen. But in terms of exactly how much time passes between the end of <em>Furiosa</em> and the beginning of <em>Fury Road… </em>Miller isn’t concerned with that, and we don’t need to be either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/akuma-just-launched-in-street-fighter-6-and-fans-have-already-discovered-two-secret-supers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're just not sure how viable they are with 30 seconds of sitting on the ground.</h2></div><section><p>Akuma has been in Street Fighter 6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-dlc-character-akuma-finally-has-a-release-date-and-yes-his-raging-demon-looks-awesome">for under a day</a>, but fans have already discovered two secret super moves he can use. The catch? You can only use them after his secret taunt - the one that involves Akuma sitting on the ground, chomping on a rice ball for 30 seconds.</p><p>Most characters only have three super moves, but Akuma has a whopping <em>seven</em>, although that includes the two hidden ones that aren't included on the move list. Despite that secrecy, various <a href="https://x.com/FGAnniversaries/status/1793344865176002632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans on social media</a> were quick to discover both the hidden taunt and the supers that come with them, which IGN has verified independently. </p><p>As mentioned, it all starts with the secret taunt. To pull that off, perform Akuma's back taunt by holding back and pressing all six buttons, then mash down on all those buttons. That'll lead to a taunt that sees Akuma eating a rice ball, and once he's finished his snack, you can perform the two hidden supers, which you can see below (along with some helpful instructions from my colleague Mitchell Saltzman):</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first is done by doing two quarter circles back and pressing kick. This one is actually a call back to Kage’s V-Trigger 1 in Street Fighter 5, Rikudo Osatsu. The other one is performed by pressing down, down, and all three punch buttons, and it's essentially his super move from Street Fighter 5.</p><p>That’s not all, though! While in this state, he can also unleash his classic double air fireballs by doing quarter circle back and two punches while jumping forward in the air, and it doesn't even cost meter.</p><p>Although, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/1cy62bu/akuma_has_2_hidden_supers_he_can_use_after_one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as fans were quick to point out</a>, the moves aren't <em>super </em>viable when it comes to competitive play, as the taunt literally leaves the warrior sitting with his back turned to his opponent for 30 seconds. Still, it's a fun Easter Egg - and, as popular fighting game streamer <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximilian Dood notes,</a> it gives Akuma players a way to open Evo matches in the funniest way possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If two Akuma players at <a href="https://twitter.com/Evo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Evo</a> start the set with this taunt, the roof will blow off the convention center. <a href="https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/w8BDsKG2Ds</a></p>— Maximilian Dood (@maximilian_) <a href="https://twitter.com/maximilian_/status/1793354716753309842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As mentioned, Akuma entered the Street Fighter 6 fray in an update just earlier today, which has led to a spike in interest for the fighting game. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, there were 70k players on Steam just earlier today, quite the jump from the 5k-25k that were playing in the days prior to the update. Akuma's a bit of a classic boss for the Street Fighter series, having been introduced all the back in Street Fighter II, so it's little surprise the see fans psyched for his addition.</p><p>IGN gave Street Fighter 6 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">a 9/10 a year ago</a>, with Saltzman writing at the time, "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2023/2900-4922/" data-ref-id="2900-4922">best games of 2023</a>.

And if you typically buy books from Amazon, you will <em>definitely </em>want to choose the hardcover collector's edition version.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">collector's edition is available for $27 (was $45)</a>, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Standard/dp/1913330036?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the standard edition paperback is currently listed for $43</a>. This is rather peculiar considering Amazon had the standard edition for around $20 at various points last year. What's even stranger is that the standard edition launched with a $30 MSRP. And yet, the price at Amazon for the standard edition has been climbing for several months--and this $43 listing is indeed shipped and sold by Amazon. But you can still <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhowl.me%2Fcmi4SadIJLq&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-guidebook-is-much-cheaper-than-the-paperback-on-amazon%2F1100-6523640%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab the standard edition guide for a great price, as Target has it for $18.79</a>.

At the same time, it's certainly possible that the collector's edition version will hover around $27 for months. That said, its all-time low price is only about a buck less, so the chances of "overpaying" at this price are pretty low.</p><div title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2397" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523640 - TotK Collector's Guide Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Complete Official Guide (Collector's Edition)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$27 (was $45)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This guide features 496 pages and covers everything you'd need to know about Tears of the Kingdom.

What sets this apart from the standard edition is its gorgeous hardcover design, making it a much more premium option than the paperback.</p>                      </div><p>If you don't want the collector's edition, consider purchasing the paperback Tears of the Kingdom Complete Guide from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FThe-Legend-of-Zelda-tm-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-The-Complete-Official-Guide-Standard-Edition-Paperback-9781913330019%2F2827029499%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fzelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-collectors-guidebook-is-much-cheaper-than-the-paperback-on-amazon%2F1100-6523640%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>. While Amazon has it listed for $43, a third-party reseller on Walmart is selling it for just $19. Still, getting the hardcover for an extra $8 is pretty enticing, as it'll likely hold up better over the years and looks great sitting on a bookshelf.</p><p>Along with the Tears of the Kingdom guide, a few other Zelda books and games are on sale.
