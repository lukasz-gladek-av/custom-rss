            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> game director Vinit Agarwal has announced he is off to Japan to start his own studio.</p>
<p>Agarwal was at Naughty Dog for a decade, before he departed the company in January of this year. During his time at the studio, he worked on both the Uncharted and The Last of Us series. Most recently, he was director of Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Sharing a "couple of life updates" on <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1942603344746537024">social media last night</a>, Agarwal said: "Moving to Japan tomorrow. Also forming a game studio - more on that soon!"</p>
<p>While the developer did not share any further specifics on exactly what he will be working on when his new studio takes shape, in an <a href="https://x.com/vinixkun/status/1930309271683772464">earlier exchange on social media</a> Agarwal said he would continue to make multiplayer games following The Last of Us online's cancellation, as that is what he is "passionate about".</p>
<p>Naughty Dog's multiplayer game was initially planned to be part of The Last of Us Part 2, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-confirms-the-last-of-us-2-wont-have-multiplayer-after-all">in 2019 the studio announced its sequel would release as a solo experience</a>, with a multiplayer aspect planned to arrive at a later date. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-says-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time">following word the studio needed more time on the project</a>, Naughty Dog ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled The Last of Us' online multiplayer release in 2023</a>. At this time, the developer said it didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Agarwal subsequently announced he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vinit-agarwal-47b3213_todays-my-last-day-naughty-dog-grateful-activity-7283634874274476032-KhfY/">leaving Naughty Dog in January of this year</a>. Sharing an update on LinkedIn, Agarwal said he was grateful for his decade at the studio, but the time had come for a "new adventure" and to make "something of [his] own". The former studio director then thanked his colleagues and mentors, namechecking Robert Cogburn, Erin Daly, Bruce Straley, Neil Druckmann and Evan Wells. Of those named, only Druckmann remains at Naughty Dog now.</p>

<p>Druckmann himself is currently working on Naughty Dog's all new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">recently stepped back from The Last of Us TV adaptation to focus on the studio</a>.

<p>Earlier this year, the star of Naughty Dog's upcoming game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-and-the-last-of-us-game-designer-starting-new-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're a fan of football games, you'll know they're likely a familiar affair at this point. A continuous river of annual releases, slight upgrades, and the prioritisation of simulating a real game of footy over anything too drastic. This might even be a bit of a stretch, with the majority of football fans starting and ending with EA Sports FC.</p>
<p>Enter Rematch, which has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">exceptionally popular</a> since its release last month. The game managed to find a gap between the big-budget defenders and snuck in a shot on goal. CEO of developer Sloclap, Pierre Tarno, told Eurogamer that this current sports game ecosystem offered the perfect opportunity to tap into a vast community.</p>

<p>Although it turns out, not necessarily football fans! Eurogamer is home to some big fans of Sloclap's moreish sports game, but even we can't deny that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Rematch players are sometimes infuriating</a>, which now is a lot easier to understand. Tarno claims: "There was a space, clearly. I do think however that our fans go further than those of sports games. In fact, we see via data, currently the core audience of Rematch lean towards those who play online competitive games rather than those who are fans of football."</p>
<p>This is true of the developers themselves, too. It may surprise you that even the developers at Slapclap aren't a collective of football fanatics. Tarno would go on to explain: "Loads of people in the team don't really care about football at all. But quite early on in the project, team mates who weren't super convinced by it - [after] when we ran internal tournaments - told me 'I get it now. I don't give a s**t about football, but this really struck something in me.' The dynamics, the team play, I think those are what make it interesting for players even if they don't like or play football games."</p>
<p>Tarno's reasoning for why the Rematch community has broken out this way is a simple one: "First of all I think it's something that's going to evolve. I think the main reason is the main portion of our untapped audience are players who are not as savvy about games, are perhaps not hardcore gamers, and are as such less aware of new releases. They may not inform themselves as much as core gamers who follow the news, monitor new releases, and will jump on games as they come out."</p>
<p>It's this ocean of sports fans that Slowclap aims to dive into through Rematch. Doing so, however, will take time: "They play FIFA, but they don't read Eurogamer. Maybe they play FIFA <em>and</em> Call of Duty! But they're just waiting for their annual release. To reach them it's about word of mouth, continuing to communicate, and keep rolling out updates."</p>
<p>As with all competitive games, the play styles in fashion change over time, new players become more familiar with the mechanics and a more established audience is cemented for the longhaul. Maybe, if we get our wish, goalies will stop trying to flick the ball over their head from inside their own area. We can hope.</p>

			<p>In the annals of mascot platformers, Gex goes largely forgotten. Behind the colossi of Mario, Sonic and even the second string of Crash and Spyro, the lecherous gecko ends up alongside the likes of Bubsy the Bob Cat in prestige. Unlike that feline protagonist, however, Gex has starred in some decent games. The relatively long-awaited Limited Run collection of the Gex Trilogy is the perfect way to try these titles on modern consoles. That being said, this is very much a time capsule of the late 90s context of the games with all that entails – good and bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gex Trilogy | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7voeA0cKjB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before going on to look at each of the three games individually, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the package as a whole. Limited Run are at pains to state that this is not a remake or remaster but instead uses their own Carbon Engine to present fully authentic versions of each game, albeit with quality of life improvements such as widescreen and analogue controls for 2 and 3. Saving is also improved, but does need to be done manually so make sure you don’t rely on the modern convenience of autosave. These are welcome improvements, but the end result is more like emulation than anything more involved and this has garnered some negative responses from buyers and fans. I knew this was the case going in and so am judging the collection based on what it is rather than any great Gexpectations. That being said, the lack of the Game Boy and N64 versions being included in the bundle is disappointing when compared to the likes of the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/"> Turtles Cowabunga Collection</a>.</p>


<p>There are a range of Gextras (Limited Run’s pun, though one I thoroughly approve of) included such as trailers, artwork, and a soundtrack player. These are nice inclusions, but feel a little clunky – the music player in particular is difficult to use. A better alternative would have been a separate soundtrack download as is the case with many collector’s editions. Looking back at the print and TV ads for the games is certainly illuminating in a nostalgic way and sets the scene for the lad’s mag and celebrity culture they were written to cater to.</p>


<p>With the context set, let’s turn to the games. First up is the 2D original Gex which is a landmark title having first been released on the 3D0 in 1995. Billed as the first 32-bit platformer it certainly turned heads back in the day, but not far enough to rescue a doomed system. Pretty soon after it was ported to PlayStation and the Sega Saturn, and it’s the former version that’s included here.</p>
<p>All that history in min,d I should probably talk about the game itself, but it’s honestly awful. Floaty controls, an overly large sprite and confusing level design all combine to make a title that is difficult to enjoy. If you do try it in order to experience the full series then at least there is a rewind function similar to most emulation programs (familiar if you’ve used the Switch Online systems) to help make it past some of the most frustrating and annoying sections. Trust me, you’ll be using this a lot.</p>

<p>With that Gextremely annoying first title out of the way things take a turn for the better. Gex: Enter the Gecko is a very traditional 3D platformer which clearly takes a great deal of influence from the likes of Mario 64 and especially Rare collectathons. Both PAL and NTSC versions are included in the package and I opted to play the European titles for the Gexclusive voice acting. The second game features the silky tones of legendary lothario Leslie Philips which makes for some entertaining incongruities as he quotes now dated cultural references such as “It’s like I’ve woken up in Boy George’s pants!”</p>
<p>Traversal through the game takes the familiar route of a hub world with portals to levels in which multiple objectives can be completed. Doing so unlocks remotes which in turn open up more levels and boss battles. While you don’t need to collect every remote to finish the game there is an Gextra ending scene in each game if you do so apparently (although they seemed to play for me without having done so). Every level also has Gexclusive collectables and gathering enough also awards a remote. As you work through the game you’ll visit a range of worlds inspired by TV and film including classic horror, kung fu movies and Looney Tunes cartoons. Gex has different costumes for each world, but these are entirely cosmetic in this title aside from a memorable boss fight where Gex gets to act out your T-Gex fantasies and fight as a kaiju.</p>

<p>The third game in the trilogy, Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, takes all the mechanics and systems from the second and improves on them. The hub world makes another appearance, although this time it’s a secret agent base for Gex who is now voiced by Danny John Jules of Red Dwarf fame. While the more modern voice acting is a much better fit for the sassy lizard, there are still the same dated references and parts that have not aged well. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Baywatch babe as Agent Xtra – Marliece Andrada, also known for the epic Playboy babes of Baywatch. Her appearances are mostly restricted to cringey video calls in which Gex gets to make some of the most inappropriate lines this side of an 80s Bond movie. The ending of the game famously suggests an altercation between the two heroes that the Angry Video Game Nerd was not Gexpecting. A Wild West level in which Gex rides a donkey also includes a caricature of the lizard as a Gexican that wouldn’t pass the sniff test nowadays.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gex Trilogy is a good window into the history of gaming and the 3D games are still fun collectathon platformers, albeit with all the camera and control issues of the originals, and the awful 2D original I never want to play again. I would have liked to see a more Gexpansive remaster, and the result may not be entirely Gexceptional, but offers enough Gexperience to give you the kind of Gexual healing that only true nostalgia can provide.	</p></div>

            <p>Naughty Dog have released a new mode for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> that lets you play out the events of the story in chronological order. Nobody who has ever read a single book can understand why.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby’s motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," say the studio in a<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/"> post introducing the new mode</a>. "While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II’s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>That important question which nobody asked. But who knows. Maybe this is great news to all those fans of The Last Of Us who dislike it when those UGH annoying storytellers at Naughty Dog do not adhere to the laws of temporal physics, telling another one of their bloody stories, but in the wrong direction. </p>
<p>"Through the new Chronological mode," say Naughty Dog, "we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more."</p>
<p>This is ominous behaviour and I do not agree with it, even if I am morbidly curious to see how batshittedly unhinged this makes the story of the game feel. Even the PlayStation's marketing spiel says that "Part II’s story is so meticulously put together" and they don't recommend this mode to new players. It might be an almost apologetic tone, were it not immediately followed by the other feature of this update: the ability to have Joel and Tommy cosplay as the Drake brothers from Uncharted.</p>

</figure>
<p>Naughty Dog call their new chronological mode "a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter." And I suppose that might be true. Imagine if Christopher Nolan released Dunkirk: The Chronological Cut. Imagine if Memento went forwards. Imagine Casablanca, but with Paris right at the start. Imagine 100 Years Of Solitude but cut up into strips of paper and sellotaped back into "proper" order.

            <p>Have you recently lost a vehicle or item in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> in a fashion that wasn't your fault? If so, you may be entitled to in-game compensation from developers Funcom, who've said sorry for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> patch "oversight" that wiped out "an unfortunate amount" of bases and gear.</p>
<p>You won't even have to enlist the services of a friendly neighbourhood Lionel Hutz or Saul Goodman either, DA's devs are already working to send out replacement stuff to affected folks. They've also pledged to tackle the cheating and item loss due to bugs that've been plaguing the game since launch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this is outlined in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/">developer update post</a> Funcom have put live this fine morning, providing some nice June 9th breakfast reading. It kicks off with the Funcom team, including Dune: Awakening's Joel Bylos, saying sorry for technical missteps while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">working to rejig the Deep Desert</a> from PvP-only to a thing that also has a bunch of PvE zones.</p>
<p>"On <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards">Monday the 7th of July</a>, we patched out a layout change to the Deep Desert which caused several areas of the PvE Deep Desert to become PvP enabled," they wrote, "This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications, which led to people suffering an unfortunate amount of lost bases and equipment. This change was intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sleepers,<br>We’re aware of the issues affecting the game and have been working hard to address them.<br>We’d like to take a moment to share more details.<br>We sincerely apologize for the bumps along the way and thank you for your continued support.<a href="https://t.co/72G2LAorGK">https://t.co/72G2LAorGK</a> <a href="https://t.co/6hPCsQY1ZE">pic.twitter.com/6hPCsQY1ZE</a></p>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1942849463652872694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As well as making changes to their processes in the hopes of preventing this sort of thing from happening again, Funcom are working to "reimburse" affected players with vehicles and gear. The devs say "reimbursed materials, items, and vehicle components" should rock up in these players' claim rewards tab by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Alongside that, the studio say they're stepping up wider efforts to make sure folks get back any vehicles that end up being banished to the great worm void by bugs, something they say they "lacked the tooling and logging" to start doing right from launch. If your Ornithopter's gone walkies to the bug dimension, you can submit a ticket in-game that'll be added to the big pile that's now being worked through.</p>
<p>Finally, Funcom say their anti-exploit team are taking aim at eliminating all of the cheating and hacking that's frustrated folks playing properly so far. "Over the next few patches, they will be introducing additional efforts to prevent exploits by increasing security on several client/server communication layer, performing additional penetration testing against common attack vectors, and auditing our item and inventory systems to make sure they are resistant to item duplication," the devs wrote. </p>
<p>So, there you go. Funcom are on the case. Tell the suited sandworm you put through Harkonnen law school to stop shuffling papers in its teeth.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear]]></content:encoded>

<p>From <strong>9th July 2025 (today!) until 22nd July</strong>, the Pipe Tour is back for its second rerun following its introduction in 2023 and first rerun in 2024. So why is this such a big deal? Well, it's the only place you can experience <strong>Piranha Plant Pipeline</strong>, a track specially created for Mario Kart Tour that can't be played elsewhere.</p>
<p>In fact, it's the only new course from Tour that wasn't included in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and it certainly isn't available in Mario Kart World either. So if you want to experience it, you'll need to get in on the action while the Pipe Tour is in session.</p>
<p>Mario Kart Tour ceased introducing new content in 2023 following the Anniversary Tour. All subsequent tours, including the current Pipe Tour, recycle previous content.</p>

<p><em>Big thanks goes to community member Grumblevolcano for bringing this to our attention.

            <p>We’ve already posted about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones">one cursed moonbase game</a> this week, but I am a creature of multitudes and always have room in my heart for another - particularly when it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunar-software-explain-routine">been in development</a> for almost as long as I’ve been posting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> is still alive, baby! Development team Lunar Software have finally posted an update about their first-person 80s-themed space horror, which had Craig Pearson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deserves-some-buzz-routine-is-amnesia-on-the-moon">rhapsodising about Kubrickian smoothies back in 2012</a>. Let's all celebrate by re-watching the last trailer.</p> <!--more-->

<p>2012! Why, it’s quite likely that <em>you</em>, dear reader, were born after this project entered development. If that’s the case, I don’t want to hear about it. Do not comment upon this article. Leave me to chew over my memories of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Do not sadden me with such bright-eyed and bushy-tailed observations as “oh wow, a triple-A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>”. Do not ask me to explain the 1980s. Hush now, go Tik a Tok or something.</p>
<p>While much-changed over the years, Routine remains a game about exploring a lunar colony that has succumbed to a creepy robot uprising. You get a handheld scanner that looks like an original Macintosh and seemingly avails you little against the saw-toothed sentinels that stalk these creaking corridors. The base appears quite capacious and (pre-droid apocalypse, anyway) cosmopolitan. As described in Lunar Software’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/503954252358484700">latest Steam post</a>, it includes a plaza where you’ll find tourist attractions, an arcade, and a mall. The post also digs into what’s been going on since the developers teamed up with publisher Raw Fury in 2022.</p>

<p>“Working on Routine has always been a huge undertaking for a team of our size and because of that, felt it was important to keep our heads down and focus entirely on finishing Routine,” the developers write. “But we are aware of the interest in our work and we are sorry for any frustration that this may have caused.</p>
<p>“In short, Routine is still very much in active development, and we are beginning to approach the finish line for the game. We’ve learned a lot from past experiences, one of those is not to commit to a release window before we’re absolutely sure we can hit it. However, we’re confident that we’ll be able to share more news on that front soon.”</p>
<p>The game is the work of a core team of three, with additional contributors coming online at intervals. When they announced it, Lunar Software had Doom composer Mick Gordon on the books, but according to the new Steam post, he left the project in July 2024 due to “conflicts in his schedule”. Nonetheless, “Mick created many outstanding audio assets that will be featured in the final game and provided invaluable audio direction for Routine” – the new audio designer and team will build on his labours.</p>
<p>When Routine was re-announced at Summer Game Fest in 2022, it had to worry about comparisons with fellow Alien-spawn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fort-solis">Fort Solis</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>. Neither of those turned out to be very good. Fingers crossed Routine will be all the better for its marathon spell in development. Fingers crossed these promises of an imminent release announcement won't become - well, you know.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gorgeous-alien-style-space-horror-routine-is-finally-nearing-the-finish-line-despite-a-key-departure]]></content:encoded>

		<p>91Act has announced that the side scrolling roguelike BlazBlue Entropy Effect will launch globally on July 22nd for Android and iOS, following an earlier release in China which saw the game get downloaded six million times. BlazBlue Entropy Effect is a spin off from the BlazBlue fighting series, taking the combat style and action from that to embed it in a different genre. The game is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273430/BlazBlue_Entropy_Effect/">Steam</a>, where it has over 25,000 reviews and sits at very positive.</p>

<p>If you want to pre-register to get BlazBlue Entropy Effect at launch, you can follow the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blazblue-entropy-effect/id6742527094">BlazBlue Entropy Effect on the App&nbsp;Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actgames.bbee.gl">BlazBlue Entropy Effect – Apps on Google Play</a></li>
</ul>
<p>BlazBlue Entropy Effect has its own original story separate to the mainline games, with Es, Mai or Hibiki available to play as for free. You can unlock further characters like Ragna the Bloodedge, Noel Vermillion, Hazama, and Bullet by using in app purchases that are called Analyzer. You need one or two of these for each character, and when you unlock enough you get the crossover character ICEY for no additional charge.</p>

			<p>There's no doubt that, even with all of Epic's efforts over the last few years, Steam remains by far the biggest online gaming store on PC. Not only that, but it also appears to be more convenient for game developers, even with Valve demanding 30% of everyone's revenue. In contrast, Epic only takes 12% (and, starting last month, only after they have passed the first million in revenue, which is completely free of charge).</p>



<p>Why is that the case? <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Steam and games industry analyst Chris Zukowski</a>, Valve successfully cultivated a user base of hoarders who buy games they don't actually play, for the most part.</p>



<p><em>Valve cracked the problem that Netflix was struggling with: how do you sell to people who have so much entertainment at their fingertips that they don’t have enough hours in the day to play and watch it all. Valve basically added infinite hours to a gamer’s day, it is a theoretical future day where gamers might someday spend hours playing your game (but let’s be honest, won’t).</em></p>



<p><em>The reason game developers are willing to give Valve 30% of their revenue is because the Steam marketplace is packed with super gamers who throw money at games they have no intention of playing. When I ran a survey of games that participated in Steam Next Fest, I found that for the median game most people only wishlist a game without even playing the demo. THE DEMO IS FREE! If players are so interested in the game, why don’t they play it!</em></p>



<p>We have one such example among our staff, actually. Our own <a href="https://wccftech.com/author/chriswray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Wray</a> owns 6,062 games on Steam, but only launched around 20% of them, as you can see <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561197977871270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on SteamDB</a>. Needless to say, his backlog is the stuff of legends. Sure, he didn't buy all the games (some we provided for the reviews), but that's only a minor percentage. For the most part, he purchased them on his own.</p>



<p>Steam does have some of the deepest discounts available for PC games, such as those seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the current Summer Sale</a>. By the way, that's ending tomorrow, just in case you're looking to buy some games you're never going to play.</p>



<p>On a more serious note, are you also afflicted with this hoarding disease? Vote in the poll and let us know below!</p>



<div id="democracy-1421" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1421,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Do you regularly buy games on Steam that you end up never playing?</strong></p></div>

		<p>Jelly Troops has been revealed by developer Nukenin Co and publisher Phoenixx Inc, with the game looking like a good, casual real time strategy title focused around capturing flags. The setting pits two wizards and their armies of jellies against each other, with players having to make critical decisions that could lead to victory in these capture the flag missions.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Release on Sept. 17th 2025]A Squishy, Strategic Caputre-the-Flag Battle &quot;Jelly Troops&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_nRjcedP8cA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Jelly Troops&nbsp;is as deep as it is cute. The inviting blue-pink aesthetic contrasts against very tense gameplay,”</em> says Waken, solo developer of Jelly Troops. <em>“The mind games are near-endless. We can’t wait to watch the meta develop over time!”</em></p>
<p>In Jelly Troops, players will need to literally grow their armies by planting Magic Fruits at base, with these fruits producing jellies. These Magic Fruits are dotted around the map, so this in itself becomes a fight for resources. It won’t be as simple as grabbing the fruits though, as powerful golems also patrol the maps. These golems can kill in one hit, so you need to find ways to move them out of your way and make them an inconvenience for your enemy. To win, you need to capture the flag and there are different approaches to this. The most obvious is by having a bigger army and overwhelming defences, but you can also send in smaller groups to sneak in and steal the flag. Various power ups will either help or hinder, with powers such as invisibility, lightning strikes, and summoning guardians all having their own impact on how things will unfold.</p>

<p>Jelly Troops has been announced for PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch, with a release date of September 17th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explosive popularity of the Fallout TV show</a>, fans started clamoring for new games in the beloved post-apocalyptic franchise. Of course, that was far from easy to accomplish for Bethesda Game Studios, which had just about started production on the long-awaited The Elder Scrolls VI. T<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here were some hints from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> that Bethesda was considering how to fast-track new games. Still, Bethesda's Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> shortly afterward that the games wouldn't be rushed out to meet some arbitrary deadline, like the show's second season.</p>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lap5F8SnoXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode of the Friends Per Second podcast on the Skill Up YouTube channel</a>, VideoGamesChronicles' Jordan Middler teased that there are indeed multiple Fallout projects in the works, including 'the one everyone wants'. However, as we already knew, the next mainline entry is still far away.</p>



<p><em>Fallout is the big one. I cannot believe that they didn't immediately start work on a Fallout 5, because Todd's not going to make it. Todd is not going to make it. He's not going to make the game. May well make it to that point of life, hopefully at the time of recording, but when he's done with the next Elder Scrolls, I can fully see him being like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm an older guy now." There are multiple Fallout projects in development, including, as far as I'm aware, that one you're all wanting. But it's not far enough along to say anything that is like, "You're going to be playing this game anytime soon." Fallout 5 should have been day one.</em></p>



<p>Now, regarding Howard's involvement, Meddler is definitely speculating. As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason to believe he wouldn't be involved in Fallout 5. He is around 55 years old, and The Elder Scrolls VI will likely launch by 2028, leaving him with enough time in his career to make another big game - the next Fallout installment, which we already know will follow TES VI.</p>



<p>As for the other projects, one is most likely the Fallout 3 remaster that was originally discovered during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial. Another project could be a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, especially since the Amazon Prime Video show's season two <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is heading to Vegas</a>. There's been some speculation that Obsidian <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be handed the reins of a full-fledged New Vegas sequel</a>, but that rumor is over three and a half years old now and Obsidian is very busy with its own projects.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-settles-lawsuit-with-samsung-on-auto-blocker-feature.1238946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games president and majority stakeholder Tim Sweeney announced that his company has settled the antitrust lawsuit it <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed in September 2024</a> against Samsung. Writing on X, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1942259929865420855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>We’re dismissing our court case against Samsung following the parties’ discussions. We are grateful that Samsung will address Epic’s concerns.</em></p>



<p>Epic's concerns were related to Samsung's introduction of the Auto Blocker security feature, which launched with the One UI 6.0 update. Auto Blocker was originally added in October 2023 as an opt-in feature that would disable app installation from sources other than the Samsung Galaxy Store and the Google Play Store. However, in July 2024, Auto Blocker became enabled by default. Epic Games stated:</p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker defaulting to “on” requires an exceptionally onerous 21 step process to download an app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store, mirroring Google’s “Unknown Sources” process with multiple steps and scare screens. Auto Blocker is the first time that Samsung has imposed additional friction on consumers who try to get apps outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store.</em></p>



<p><em>Auto Blocker undermines the jury’s unanimous decision in Epic v. Google, specifically that “Google entered into one or more agreements that unreasonably restrained trade in a relevant antitrust market” including “Agreements with OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] that sell mobile devices”.</em></p>



<p>Epic Games is, of course, referring to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">historic win in the anticompetitive lawsuit against Google</a>, dating back to December 11, 2023, when Judge James Donato of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Google had violated antitrust laws by maintaining the Play Store as the dominant storefront for Android. This included making deals to ensure that apps would be published exclusively through the Play Store and requiring that the Play Store be installed on third-party devices. The Judge also ordered Google to allow alternative app stores on the Android system and temporarily prohibited them from offering monetary incentives to developers who release exclusively on the Play Store.</p>



<p>The Epic Games Store eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched on Android and iOS</a> (although only in Europe in the latter case, at least for now) on August 16, 2024, following Epic's strenuous legal efforts against Google and Apple.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The Girls' Frontline series is back in a big way with the release of Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium—now available on PC and mobile! This free-to-play strategy RPG sequel builds on everything fans loved in the original game, now with a fully 3D battlefield, evolved mechanics, and a fresh roster of Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) ready for action.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a returning Commander or just starting out, Exilium offers a gorgeous, anime-inspired experience thanks to next-gen rendering tech, deep tactical gameplay, and a variety of mini-games to keep things fresh. It's everything you loved about the original and so much more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle-Ready T-Dolls Take the Spotlight</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326"></a><figcaption>Springfield and Peri are ready for action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest update brings new Elite T-Dolls to recruit, with increased drop-rates for Springfield, Peri, and Mechty (Rerun). Each brings their own strengths to your squad—and yes, you can deck them out in stylish outfits, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield, a powerhouse support unit, is perfect for Hydro-focused teams. Her ability to overheal and boost allies makes her an essential part of any strong lineup. She's available now in the limited-time Targeted Procurement banner, so if you've been hoarding Collapse Pieces and Targeted Access Permissions, now's your chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Pair her with the Radiance rifle: a custom Elite-class weapon designed just for her. It increases Hydro damage team-wide, boosts HP by 15%, and amplifies Springfield's key abilities. Based on the real-world M1903, this sleek rifle delivers both style and stopping power.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Peri Brings the Fire</h2><p dir="ltr">Peri–a Bulwark unit–is all about aggressive tactics. She dishes out Burn damage at the cost of her own HP, but can activate a powerful shield to stay in the fight longer. You can unlock her for free through the Standard Banner by completing event tasks during the current limited-time event.</p><p dir="ltr">Her signature weapon? A deceptively dainty SMG based on the MP5H1 that hits like a truck. And don't sleep on Faye—her elite handgun, Hestia, modeled after the CZ75, turns her into a true Goddess of Flame on the battlefield and is a portable powerhouse.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dress to Impress: Limited-Time Outfits</h2><p dir="ltr">What's a new T-Doll without a killer outfit? Several stunning looks are available at limited-time discounts:</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield's "Queen in Radiance" outfit isn't just elegant—it's also the first 3D main screen wallpaper in the game, complete with dance interactions and Scenic Tour animations.</p><p dir="ltr">Faye's "Flurry Crimson" ensemble channels her inner flame with dancer-inspired flair.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Style Up Your Arsenal</h2><p dir="ltr">Don't let your weapons feel left out, because new skins are here too! Springfield's Midnight Waltz pairs perfectly with her Radiance outfit for a dazzling ballroom blitz combo. And for a retro-futuristic edge, grab the Dawn Sentry, a stylish homage to old-school sci-fi.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Free Pulls, Codes, and a Shot at Real-World Prizes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328"></a><figcaption>Here's a closer look at all the rewards you can earn in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium is feeling generous this month, as you can grab 40 free banner pulls, the free T-Doll Faye, free Targeted Access Permissions, and more this month.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance to win prizes like the iPhone 16, Razer keyboard, and tons of in-game loot through the Defend Zucchero Café event.</p><p dir="ltr">Got a US server account?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm genuinely asking. I force myself to open it up every week or two for professional reasons (people still inexplicably send me DMs and such), and every time I do I'm confronted by three things.</p><p>The first is wall-to-wall garbage. Slop. Ads for crypto scams, ads for AI scams, ads for dropshippers that will never deliver the product they're selling, ads for all of the above right in the middle of replies to a thread. All of them occupying the space that used to contain discussions, or at least (and how low is this bar!) ads from real companies.</p><p>The second is, well.<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> This</a> (which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/701884/grok-antisemitic-hitler-posts-elon-musk-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompted some emergency work behind the scenes</a>)</p><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a></figcaption></figure><p>Elon Musk first bought the site in 2022. It's now July 2025, and I just don't know how else to ask this but: what will it take to get you off Twitter? Because the third thing I see, despite all the fascists and slopsters and antisemitic artificial intelligence, despite the cliff-like drop-off in engagement metrics, is people I know still going through the motions and<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> using the site like it was 2017</a>.</p><p>I refuse to believe there is anything you are getting there, whether it be social or professional, that is worth the constant exposure to and indirect support of an outwardly fascist social media platform. Like, read the paragraph above this one back to yourself, and tell me honestly if it's worth all of that just so you can continue to try to post some anime memes or catch some sports highlights or talk to the other three people you're still talking to who haven't deleted their account or moved to Bluesky because "I'm just tired of making new social media accounts, man".</p><p>I realise Aftermath still "posts" to Twitter, in that we have a central platform that shares our links to all our social media at once, and that gnaws at me on a weekly basis. I wanted to delete our Twitter<a href="https://x.com/LukePlunkett/status/1861687549972164623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when I wiped my own account last year</a>, but was outvoted (we have 14k followers there, people are still discovering our work there, etc), which is how a cooperatively owned company works. </p><p>But like, is even <em>this </em>bad? Does even a fire-and-forget model, where very few people are actively engaging with our work and we are not engaging with it as a staff <em>at all</em>, help prop up this dogshit platform? I think so, especially as it gets worse and worse, somehow even worse than last year when I first brought it up. And I think the same of everyone else, from IGN to Kotaku to GameSpot to Eurogamer, who are auto-posting there as well. It’s just not worth it!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/twitter-elon-musk-grok-antisemitic-mechahitler]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Clubhouse Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5d929e42bbd22/clubhouse-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo rolled out multiple free Switch 2 game updates for select Switch games last month and one of them was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/clubhouse_games_51_worldwide_classics">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this same title has been updated again, this time with a patch to make the overall gameplay experience more enjoyable and resolve some issues. If we find out about anything going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here are the official patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released July 8, 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Update data that supports the above content has also been distributed for “Clubhouse Games: Guest Pass” as Ver. 2.0.1d.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Again, this follows a major Version 2.0.0 update which added features to this title like GameShare - allowing you to play 34 kinds of games with up to four players. This also follows an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> last week.</p>

<p>Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> arrived on the Switch 2 alongside the new chapters last month and since then it's been getting some additional patches.</p>
<p>The latest one has now arrived and it bumps the Switch and Switch 2 version up to Version 1.02. It's a "bugfix patch" resolving multiple issues across Chapters 2, 3 and 4. There are also some Switch 2-specific fixes, and there have been some other minor updates made across "all chapters".</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune (Version 1.02) - 8th July 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the room with fireworks where the floor switch can be pressed by an invisible character.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key Items received from the Ball Machine no longer incorrectly persist outside of that room. This caused numerous issues, including not being able to receive the Shadow Crystal from a certain boss.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Susie and Ralsei would appear completely shadowed if defeated by a boss’s attack.</li>
<li>In a room where Susie destroys houses, she no longer stops moving erroneously after the battle. However, she now slides around erroneously. Apparently, this is better.</li>
<li>Attempted to fix issues on Board 1 where you can see duplicate Ralseis as well as make Ralsei disappear indefinitely.</li>
<li>Fixed some situations where borders were not displaying correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some places where the characters were the normal color in an area that has abnormal coloration.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it’s possible to get temporarily stuck in a playable piano.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue during an optional battle where the damage numbers done to the players were not visible. Additionally, the heal numbers were moving further to the right every time they appeared.</li>
<li>Removed the erroneous appearance of a duplicate Kris in the closet.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an exploit where you can generate infinite untouchable cats if you touch them with the backside of the shield.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a misalignment of the petting effect and the mouse position.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a crash if you saved your game in the “Mike Zone” on Nintendo Switch, then imported your save file to Nintendo Switch 2 and continued from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Chapters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Master Volume” setting now persists between Chapters when using the same file.</li>
<li>Updated the save data import messages when first launching the game. Now, if you have more than one app’s save data on your console (for example, if you have saves from both the older version of the Chapter 1&amp;2 demo as well as the newer version), it will display them as a list so you can choose the one you want to import. (Note: The import messages only appear if you have no existing save data for the full version of the game…)</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an issue where the game displays at the wrong size on 1440p. Additionally, there are several other minor aesthetic fixes across chapters 2, 3, and 4.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The developer also notes how testing of the next patch is "already underway" and the next two patches will contain some "extremely slight adjustments to gameplay in addition to bug fixes".</p>

Whether you're looking for something light and fast or deep and strategic, there’s something in this year's sale worth grabbing. Just don’t wait too long, stock will disappear fast, and the best offers rarely hang around past the main Prime Day event.</p></div><p id="more-prime-day-deals"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="More Prime Day deals">More Prime Day Deals</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the last two weeks, I’ve sought to uncover why the Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t work with a host of USB-C accessories that worked perfectly fine with other devices, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">including third-party docks</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">some of the best-reviewed webcams</a>. But today, I have first-hand confirmation that existing gadgets <em>can</em> work — as long as their manufacturers issue the right firmware updates, and as long as Nintendo doesn’t break compatibility from here on out.</p><p>You shouldn’t necessarily need to buy a brand-new gadget to plug a TV or video glasses into your Nintendo Switch 2. Three manufacturers have already proven that firmware updates are enough for now, and hopefully more will follow!</p><p>The existing gadgets I just successfully tested are: the <strong>AverMedia Elite Go GC313 Pro</strong> and <strong>AverMedia Core Go GC313</strong> compact charger docks, the <strong>Elgato Facecam MK.2 </strong>webcam, and the <strong>Viture Pro Mobile Dock</strong> for the company’s AR glasses.</p><p>None of them worked with the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, but each now has firmware updates available, and I was able to get them all working in my own home — and maybe, set a few more things straight about Switch 2 compatibility.</p><div><p id="elgato"><h2>Elgato</h2></p></div><p><strong>The story:</strong> Elgato was one of the very first companies to promise it would update some non-working webcams to work with the Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">provided its own theories to <em>The Verge</em></a> on why they didn’t work on day one. The company won’t formally release its firmware updates for the Facecam MK2 and Facecam Neo till the end of July, but it sent us an early copy so I could show you video proof!</p><p>Here, follow along with me as I install and test it for the very first time:</p><p>(Sorry, I’m not allowed to share the early firmware update files.)</p><p><strong>What we learned: </strong>Elgato originally claimed the primary reason its cameras didn’t work was that the Nintendo Switch 2 requires cameras to advertise a low-resolution 480p video mode, even if that’s not the mode the Switch 2 winds up using. Sure enough: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-use-and-install-usbview/e66494f9-05ce-439e-bcbe-c074b36d4272">the USBView tool</a> shows me that the Facecam MK2 now makes 480p the default video streaming mode that a USB host device (like the Switch 2) will see before anything else.</p><p>Also: Remember when Ugreen told us that cameras wouldn’t work with Switch 2 if they used the HID (human interface device) protocol? Weirdly, it seems Elgato actually <em>added</em> some HID references in its latest firmware. <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/S0k5VI8i/">Here’s the diff</a> if you want to peek.</p><div><p id="avermedia"><h2>AverMedia</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><strong>The story:</strong> I’d never even heard of these 100W GaN compact charging docks, the $130 GC313 Pro and the $90 GC313 — but it now appears they’re the first and only portable docks for the Switch 2! (The Pro also doubles as a 1080p60 USB capture card, if you’re wondering about the price delta.) The company has <a href="https://www.avermedia.com/NS2-compatibility-status">a whole page dedicated to Switch 2 compatibility firmware updates</a>, mostly for its video capture devices, but also these portable docks, as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AVerMedia-Charging-Screen-Mirroring-Capture/dp/B0DBSND34P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a more traditional standing dock</a> if you don’t mind plugging your Switch in upside-down.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: The firmware update was quick to install and the HDMI connection totally works — probably because AverMedia’s dock is now using the exact same proprietary commands that we see Nintendo’s official dock using. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">Once again</a>, I pulled out a USB-C PD analyzer to check. Before the update, AverMedia’s dock didn’t speak Nintendo’s language and was quickly rejected; after the update, it did.)</p><p>AverMedia’s dock didn’t work quite as reliably as the official dock in my early tests. It doesn’t always connect the first time I plug it in, and there’s also a short delay. Also note: the GC313 only seems to support vanilla 4K60 output with no HDR or VRR.</p><p>As you’ll read below, video glasses maker Viture has a firmware update that makes its gadgets compatible with Switch 2 — but <em>takes away</em> compatibility with the original Nintendo Switch. But I tested the AverMedia dock working with <em>both</em> generations of Switch, and Viture says it’ll do the same in future.</p><div><p id="viture"><h2>Viture</h2></p></div><p><strong>The story</strong>: This $130 dock is a battery pack that can power your handheld or phone, while routing its video to Viture’s USB-C video glasses or a USB-C monitor. (The HDMI port is for input, not output to a TV.) <a href="https://academy.viture.com/mobile_dock/update">With a firmware update</a>, it gains support for Switch 2, but breaks support for the original Switch unless you downgrade afterwards. A future update will support both, though, Viture co-founder Emily Wang tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: Viture shipped me its dock pre-updated, so I didn’t test before-and-after. But with the update, it totally works — after a bit of a delay, which seems to stem from some miscommunication between Viture’s gadgets and the Switch 2, if I’m reading the USB-C PD traffic right. But after that miscommunication, I can see the Viture dock sends the exact same proprietary commands as Nintendo’s official dock.</p><p>One of the things we’d heard early on is that Switch 2 docking stations need to offer 20 volts of power for the Switch 2 to kick into TV mode — even though the handheld only actually uses 15 volts. But the Viture dock only advertises a maximum of 15 volts at 1.34 amps (20 watts in total), and yet Viture got video output working anyhow.</p><div><p id="what-happens-next"><h2>What happens next?</h2></p></div><p>We know these third-party docks are working with the Switch 2 as of today, and we expect more are on the way.</p><p>(One I didn’t get to test is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lrs7mh/hagibis_switch_2_dock_hdmi_cable_for_only_20/">this Hagabis</a>, which fits the entire HDMI adapter into a cable instead of a dock — beware that <a href="https://hagibis.bbscloud.com/info/38597196f50d47b0a523a002dd8590ba?csr=1">the firmware update</a> only official works with the 8K version <strong>which is black</strong>, <em>not white or red and blue </em>and keeps going out of stock.)</p><p>But we don’t know if Nintendo will move to block these accessories with firmware updates of its own. Today, it appears that each of these docks can fool the Switch 2 into thinking they’re the official dock by emulating its commands, but several manufacturers admit that could lead to a game of cat-and-mouse where they have to issue new firmware updates to keep up with Nintendo.</p><p>“Similar to what Antank shared with you, it’s true that we may need to provide firmware updates if Nintendo changes its protocol specifications,” Viture tells<em> The Verge. </em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware]]></content:encoded>

This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft PR also confirmed that no other Ubisoft locations were impacted by today's layoffs. However, the company did not respond to IGN's request for information on how many employees remain at Red Storm or the status of the company's current projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Red Storm was originally Red Storm Entertainment, founded by author Tom Clancy specifically to make games based on his novels, including Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. The studio was acquired by Ubisoft in 2000, going on to create hits such as the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series and assisting on other popular Tom Clancy games such as The Division. In more recent years, it has taken a backseat role as more of a VR and support studio beginning with Werewolves Within in 2016. and continuing more recently with Star Trek: Bridge Crew and Assassin's Creed Nexus VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Storm also worked on a canceled Splinter Cell VR game, and the also-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">The Division Heartland</a>. Most recently, Red Storm assisted on XDefiant, which just shut down completely last month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">an announcement last year</a>. At the time, Ubisoft shut down the San Francisco and Osaka studios behind the game, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-16/ubisoft-entertainment-cuts-45-people-from-its-us-staff?embedded-checkout=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some layoffs occuring at Red Storm as well</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has laid off a number of employees at its Red Storm studio, which has most recently focused on a number of VR initiatives for the publisher, as well as supporting development on titles such as XDefiant.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tom-clancy-star-trek-bridge-crew-studio-ubisoft-red-storm-lays-off-19-citing-global-cost-saving-efforts" rel="nofollow ">reported by IGN</a>, Ubisoft has cut 19 jobs at Red Storm, citing "ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts" for its reasoning.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft released a full statement to IGN, which reads, "Today, Ubisoft made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment. This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft."</p><p dir="ltr">It is currently unclear how deep these cuts at Red Storm, which has become a VR and support studio over the last several years, go or how they will impact any ongoing projects at the team. Ubisoft PR confirmed to IGN though that this restructuring is not indicative of any larger cuts occurring at the French publisher or of its other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Storm, which was founded in 1996 and created stalwart franchises under the Tom Clancy banner such as the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series, most recently released Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which is exclusively available on Meta Quest 2 and above. Besides this release, which marks the long-running franchise's debut on virtual reality platforms, the studio has spent much of the last few years supporting games like XDefiant, which was shut down earlier this year, and working on a pair of canceled projects, including a canned Splinter Cell VR title and a free-to-play spin-off title in The Division series subtitled Heartland.</p><p dir="ltr">The former was axed back in 2022 while the latter lingered for a while longer--even being played in closed alpha tests--before being indefinitely delayed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">ultimately shelved</a> in 2024 amidst wider cuts at a tough time for the embattled publisher, which recently entered into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">partnership with Tencent</a>.</p>
