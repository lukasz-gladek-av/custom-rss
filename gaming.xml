            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has filed for insolvency, with newly-appointed general manager&nbsp;Térence Mosca citing "prolonged market conditions" as the reason for the studio's predicament.</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Mosca says he's proud of what his team "has accomplished together", but that the aforementioned market conditions gave his studio no choice other than filing for insolvency.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Tequila Works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">canceled an unannounced project</a> and laid off an unspecified number of staff back in October, calling the current moment in the gaming industry an "incredibly difficult time". Evidently, those layoffs and that cancellation weren't enough to save the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=9k1Rc0Q0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=LjOf2zZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that insolvency isn't necessarily the same thing as a studio shutdown; essentially, insolvency means an entity isn't able to pay the debts it's incurred, which means Tequila is functionally out of money but not necessarily defunct yet.</p>

<p>As such, the studio could undergo a reorganization under Mosca, although it looks like it might take a pretty mighty reorganization effort in order to save a studio that seems to have been struggling for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the statement provided by GI.biz, Mosca says that the studio is doing everything it can to "provide support and guidance to our teams", an assurance that was also made when the studio laid off staff and canceled its project last month.</p>

<p>The statement notably doesn't say that Tequila has canceled its remaining project or laid off the remainder of its staff, so it's possible we may see Tequila rising from the ashes at some point in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=LSlQWP4B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=cuhNEQBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous games by Tequila Works include time-loop puzzler&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Tequila Works was founded in 2009 and released its first game, cinematic zombie platformer&nbsp;<em>Deadlight</em>, in 2012. That game was followed by titles like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Gylt</em>, as well as last year's&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what lies in Tequila Works' future, but don't be surprised if we don't hear from the studio for some time. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up has revealed more details on the game's upcoming PC release, and it has high expectations for the platform. In the studio's Q3 2024 earnings report, Shift Up confirmed that Stellar Blade is "being considered within 2025" for a PC release--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-considering-a-pc-port-and-sequel/1100-6523587/">something it has spoken about in the past</a>.</p><p>"Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles," <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up said in its report</a>. To put that into context, Black Myth: Wukong had a strong launch in August with <a

figure that can potentially be reached with its upcoming expansion. In comparison, Stellar Blade reached 1 million sales on PS5 by the end of June.</p><p>Shift Up also mentioned that sales on PS5--where Stellar Blade is exclusively available for now--continue to remain stable, thanks in part to the studio constantly updating the game and releasing new DLC for it.

The Pokemania phenomenon has since grown to include multiple anime series, films, trading-card games, toys, and more. Pokemon was also one of the 12 finalists to make it into this year's inductees for the Toy Hall of Fame. However, Pikachu and his pals are going to have to wait until at least 2025 after being denied this year.</p><p>The National Toy Hall of Fame has <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its new inductions for 2024</a>, and Pokemon didn't make the cut. But at least Pokemon is in good company. The Choose Your Own Adventure books, remote-controlled vehicles, Hess Toy Trucks, trampoline, Apples to Apples, and Sequence were also denied the honor.</p><p>Hasbro was the big winner, as two of its 1980s franchises, Transformers and My Little Pony, earned their induction into this year's class at the Toy Hall of Fame. The Transformers toys debuted in 1984, and the franchise has largely endured for four decades. My Little Pony was originally launched as My Pretty Pony in 1981 before it became a hit toy line of its own. MLP went dormant for a few years before a 2003 revival proved to successful. The card game Phase 10 was the final 2024 inductee for the Toy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Pokemon may not have won this year, but its ongoing popularity is staggering. On the Nintendo Switch alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">the Pokemon franchise has sold 99 million units</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios--which was co-founded by Battlefield veteran Patrick Soderlund--reversed course on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-delay-has-completely-changed-its-genre/1100-6514238/" data-ref-id="1100-6514238">Arc Raiders</a>. What was originally envisioned as a free-to-play shooter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/" data-ref-id="1100-6525993">shifted over to a premium release</a>. Now, the latest gameplay video for Arc Raiders demonstrates why Embark Studios felt confident about making that move as it shows off an impressive--and dangerous--post-apocalyptic world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game takes place in a future where humanity has retreated beneath the surface of the Earth to escape the lethal Arc machines, which are programed to slaughter any humans they find. Players assume the role of one of the Raiders, who risk their lives by returning to the surface to find badly needed supplies while evading both the machines as well as rival Raiders who aren't looking to share any of the spoils.</p><p>Getting in and out of the locations isn't easy, even though having a team to watch your back helps increase the odds of survival. The smaller Arc machines are always on patrol, and the larger machines aren't as easy to dispatch as their counterparts. Enemy Raiders can also ambush a team before they reach their extraction point. But that's only going to draw the attention of the Arc machines, which will target both sides of the conflict. As far as the machines are concerned, the only good human is a dead one.</p><p>Although Arc Raiders isn't finished yet, this early gameplay is already looking good. Embark Studios will release the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025.</p>

Blizzard has announced a new partnership with the University of Washington in which the college will become the University of Warcraft for a week in the lead up to the Washington Huskies' home finale against UCLA.</p><p>UW Football is collaborating with WoW to promise a "one-of-a-kind in-stadium experience" on Friday, with World of Warcraft mascots leading the team onto the field, a fan zone offering character meet-and-greets, and unique visuals for the stadium video board. Blizzard has also revealed a unique logo for its University of Warcraft collaboration, and has promised more unique WoW-themed graphics leading up to the game.</p><p>Blizzard is also getting some of the Washington Huskies team on board for the takeover, signing NIL (name, image, likeness) deals with players Carson Bruener, Denzel Boston, Jonah Coleman, Camden Simon, Adam Mohammad, Kamren Fabiculanan, Jacob Lane, Cameron Broussard, D’Angalo Titialli, Demond Williams Jr., and Will Rodgers. The players will be posting about the collab on social media to promote the Warcraft takeover--though its not clear if they'll be making an appearance in the game itself.</p><p>"We are thrilled to unite interactive entertainment with the sports industry to celebrate 20 incredible years of World of Warcraft delighting millions of players worldwide," said Blizzard head of marketing Monica Austin, as quoted by <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/name-image-likeness/nil-news/world-of-warcraft-makes-nil-debut-with-washington-huskies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>. "Our teams have been working together to create incredible in-person and broadcast experiences for fans, and we hope Husky Nation and World of Warcraft players alike are excited to WoW down to Washington."</p><p>The Warcraft-themed game is taking place this Friday November 15 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET at Husky Stadium in Seattle, and will be broadcast on Fox for anyone curious to see how this unexpected collaboration plays out.</p>

<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that Xbox is planning an Xbox handheld console, but it’s a few years away from release.</p>



<p>The news comes from a new interview with <a href="http://eyjzb3vyy2uioijtdwjzy3jpymvyr2lmdgvkqxj0awnszsisimlhdci6mtczmtq5otu0mswizxhwijoxnzmymta0mzqxlcjhcnrpy2xlswqioijttvcxq01umecxs1cwmcisimjjb25uzwn0swqioijcmuvbqki5njq2qum0rezfqtjbrki4mji1mzgyqtjfqsj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. Spencer said that the company is currently working on prototypes and considering what it [a handheld console] might do.</p>



<p>Spencer said the “expectation [internally] is that we would do something”&nbsp;in that category of the handheld console market.</p>



<p>However, if you’re currently saving up the pennies in hopes of buying such a console soon, Spencer promptly squashed any false expectations and said that such a device is still a few years out.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, rumors of Xbox’s next-generation console and a handheld device have been circulating for some time. In March 2024, <span>Windows Central’s Jez Corden&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed that Xbox was already prototyping an Xbox handheld.</a>&nbsp;Other rumors also circulated</span> that Xbox could be planning to release its next-generation console sooner than PlayStation. </p>



<p>On the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By7ne7lHKLY&amp;ab_channel=RandalThor19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden said, “I know that they’ve [Xbox] have got handheld prototypes right now”. Corden soon clarified that these are “new prototypes” and not the old prototypes often referred to.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox announced that its next-generation console</a> would be “unique” and “powerful.” But apart from usual buzzwords, its currently not clear on what exactly that entails.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox working on its own handheld console? Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has said there's nothing stopping any of the company's games coming to Nintendo or PlayStation platforms in the future.
</p>
<p>
"I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say 'thou must not,'" Spencer told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth">Bloomberg</a>, adding that it was still too early to discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">Microsoft's plans for the next Halo</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">now being built in the cross-platform-friendly Unreal Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox launched Pentiment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> across a mixture of PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">to some success</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">more than 1m sales reported for Rare's popular piratical live-service game</a>. Microsoft will follow this with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation launch for Xbox's biggest Christmas blockbuster, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, early next year. The expectation is that many other Xbox games will follow.

<p>
In a wide-ranging interview, Spencer also discussed his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">long-held desire to launch some kind of Xbox handheld</a>. Microsoft is currently working on prototypes and considering the market, Spencer said, though the launch of an official Xbox handheld is still a few years out. (So, no Xbox handheld before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)
</p><p>
Spencer also said Xbox still "definitely want to be in the market" to acquire other companies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">Microsoft's record-setting $68.7bn buyout of Activision Blizzard</a>. That said, deals of similar size were currently unlikely due to the still-ongoing process of merging in Activision teams.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox chief said he was still looking for deals that added "geographic diversity", such as teams in Asia, despite it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">walking away from Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</a> earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Spencer concluded, when asked how he felt about 2025 after a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">punctuated</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">repeated layoffs</a>. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

			<p>Any title in the Xbox portfolio of games can be considered for a port on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, as Phil Spencer doesn't see a red line in this regard.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczMTQ5OTU0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzMyMTA0MzQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTVcxQ01UMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.UjaVdB-1hJKO1VKY0-vUQaOjf2cpmUgGaLSXNqqYnHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Xbox commented on a variety of topics, including porting Xbox titles to other formats. Phil Spencer is pleased with the results of the first batch of games released on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch so far, and more will be coming in the future. In regard to which titles will make the jump in the future, the head of Xbox said that he sees no sort of red lines in their portfolio that say "thou must not," but it's definitely too early to make any sort of decision on the next entry in the Halo series. As such, it really sounds like nothing is off the table, although a day-and-date release on Xbox and other consoles at the same time doesn't sound very likely.</p>
<p>Phil Spencer also touched upon the handheld market, which has been thriving in the past few years. The head of Xbox said that the "expectation" is that the company is going to do something in this regard. At this stage, they are working on prototypes and considering the future, and Phil Spencer asked his team to look at the market and develop their device based on what is learned. This device, Spencer added, is a few years out, so we won't be seeing it anytime soon.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Xbox head Phil Spencer has talked about the rumored handheld, but it is the first time he commented on the matter in a more concrete way. As the device is still a few years away, however, there's no telling what it will be capable of doing and if it will be focused on local play, as Spencer himself hinted at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/">earlier this year.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-player-count-how-many-people-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25</a> allows players to create and develop their very own farms, with a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-animals-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/products-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">products</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crops</a> to choose from. Raising animals and harvesting crops is a rewarding experience, and many love the realism and progression Farming Simulator offers.</p>



<p>You’ll need to put in the hours though, as farm work isn’t easy. Speaking of which, if you’re wondering how many are online dedicating their time to their virtual farm, here’s the Farming Simulator 25 player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-farming-simulator-25-player-count">Farming Simulator 25 player count</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 has <strong>44,265 live players on Steam</strong> at the time of writing (November 13, 2024), and an <strong>all-time peak player count of 126,761</strong> on Valve’s platform, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The all-time peak was reached on its release date of November 12, 2024, which saw players flocking to start their farming journey.</p>



<p>These numbers are only for players enjoying the game via Steam on PC, and as the game is available through other platforms on PC and also consoles, the player count is likely much higher than what’s found on SteamDB.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-player-count-for-farming-simulator-25-on-consoles">Is there a player count for Farming Simulator 25 on consoles?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 is also <strong>available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</strong>, but unfortunately, we <strong>do not have access to the player count numbers</strong> on these platforms. However, it’s safe to assume that the player count would be much higher if the player count was accumulated for all the platforms the game is available on.</p>



<p>The game also features cross-platform play and a multiplayer feature for up to 16 players on a dedicated server and up to 6 on console servers. The multiplayer feature is very popular for Farming Simulator and it’s likely one of the main reasons for its high player count, as people are hopping on to create a farm on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive maps</a> with friends.</p>



<p>If the devs, Giants Software, ever decide to release details on the Farming Simulator 25 player count or sales numbers across all of the platforms the game is available on, we’ll be sure to update this piece with all the relevant information.</p>

<p>The official FNCreate account on <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1856366599059427510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has revealed that Fortnite’s First-Person Camera Mode device publishing will arrive on December 11, 2024. As the announcement hasn’t come from the main Fortnite account, the first-person mode will be reserved for Fortnite Creative and will not be included in the game’s standard battle royale mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s first-person mode has been rumoured to arrive for years, and players finally have an official date to look forward to. It will be interesting to see what kind of island creators come up with this new perspective, what kind of weapons will be compatible with this mode and other features. Hopefully, the implementation in creative mode will pave the way for the first-person to arrive in the standard battle royale mode, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original map of the game will be returning permanently</a> from December 6, so players can enjoy Season 1 Chapter 1 whenever they wish.

		<p>Embark Studios has released a gameplay reveal trailer for their upcoming survival extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay footage comes from an early tech test that was held in October, following a group of three Raiders as they head out from the human haven of Speranza City and look to explore the surface and the Buried City to find vital resources – each player can have different objectives and goals, it seems.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s other players out there, and if you come across another Raider you can chat using a quick wheel of dialogue options, potentially trying to share the spoils with someone outside of your party instead of having a gunfight.</p>
<p>Any time a Raider is knocked down, a flare goes up to mark their position, though you’ll never be sure if they were in a fight with the ARC robots or ended up in a scuffle with other players.</p>

<p>Set for release in 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, ARC Raiders will be venturing into an increasingly busy genre. The extraction shooter and PvPvE multiplayer has become a popular follow on and counterpart to the battle royale over the past half decade, with the most popular examples including Escape from Tarkov and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/hunt-showdown-1896-review/">Hunt: Showdown</a>, while there’s both big budget upcoming games like Bungie’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> and scrappier upstarts like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/ascendant-preview-how-this-80s-adaption-shooter-is-evolving-beyond-extraction/">Ascendant</a>.</p>
<p>This game has had a fair bit of time in the oven. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/arc-raiders-trailer-game-awards/">ARC Raiders was announced back in 2021</a> at The Game Awards, initially with a 2022 release target, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/09/free-to-play-shooter-arc-raiders-will-miss-2022-launch/">which it then slipped from</a>. Helmed by ex-Battlefield lead Patrick Söderlund, the team explained that they need more time to expand their take on the co-op shooter, seemingly shifting away from pure PvE originally to bake in the PvPvE elements.</p>
<p>It eventually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/arc-raiders-re-emerges-with-a-2025-release-target/">reemerged back during Summer Games Fest</a> with a new 2025 target launch. Between now and then, it seems likely that more tech tests and betas will be held, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">sign up for these tests on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>TiMi Studio Group and Capcom have just announced Monster Hunter Outlanders for iOS and Android devices. It is an upcoming open-world survival game set in the Monster Hunter universe. The developers did not provide a release date in the new announcement trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer footage, players can explore a massive open world featuring different types of biomes, such as jungles, swamps, deserts, and more. You will see some familiar monsters from previous instalments and maybe some new ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer also revealed different types of traversal mechanics players can use in this world. Regarding traversal tools, we see the player character use a glider to cover large distances, a grapple to move more freely in jungles and a catapult that launches them in the air. We also get to see the character climb rocky surfaces and swim in some water bodies, so you won’t just be running around in this massive world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000226.000084968.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/timi-studio-group-and-capcom-announce-monster-hunter-outlanders-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), Monster Hunter Outlanders will be a free-to-play title but will include in-app purchases. Players can enter the game solo or bring up to four players in their party. During your journey, you will find different types of characters; they can be recruited as allies and are also playable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game will also introduce a crafting function that makes exploring this open world easier. Moreover, players can use weapons they have seen in the previous Monster Hunter titles, as the developers have optimised the battle system to make it “as enjoyable as possible” while “retaining the gameplay experience” from previous games”. &nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Horizon Adventures Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-review.1034478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me a while to figure Lego Horizon Adventures out. It’s the action game equivalent of watching the movie version of a book you like: It hits the major points, takes some liberties with characters and events, and then wraps everything up with a shiny bow in an abridged length. And like so many Hollywood adaptations, it handles the source material well without ever hitting the same heights. After spending 21 hours reaching 100% completion, I enjoyed nearly everything about its beautiful world and rich customization options, but predictable level design,  and a lack of things to do beyond the modest yet well-paced campaign made it feel like I was building a Lego set while missing a page or two from the instruction manual.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Horizon Adventures is a playful retelling of 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in the body of a typical Lego co-op action game. While it may not go into the depths of that story when it comes to the world or Aloy's origins, the broad strokes paint an entertainingly familiar picture for existing fans that’s still simple enough for newcomers to enjoy as well. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 12-hour campaign took me across recognizable regions like the foliage-filled forest of the Sacred Lands, the frigid Snowchant Mountains, and the scorching hot Sunfall Desert. Each mission is filled with swaths of machines and cultists to overcome, chests filled with Studs (basically Lego money) to collect, objects to build or break, and plenty of charming character moments to keep the journey enjoyable. Those moments are often brief, but plenty of them had me chuckling from start to finish. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout Aloy's Journey, she's joined by an eclectic cast of playable allies: Rost, her mentor and father figure; Varl, a young Nora hunter looking to prove himself; Teersa, the village elder who's never short on quips; and Erend, a lovable brute with a big hammer. It’s great that original voice actors Ashly Burch, John Hopkins, John Macmillan, and nearly everyone else you encounter are back to reprise their roles, and the lighthearted tone of this outing gives them all room to experiment and have fun with characters I otherwise know well in some amusing ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one unfortunate exception to this is Sylens. He is back too, this time with a love of DJ'ing as he assists Aloy and friends from afar, but with a new voice actor after the tragic passing of Lance Reddick last year. Sylens has always been a reserved character, but I wish his sharp tongue had been showcased more in the many scenes with him in Lego Horizon Adventures, and the new performance from Tim Russ can often feel flat or clash with the energy and playfulness of the other characters. However, I will say that the decision to make him a DJ is inspired, and a fitting match for the zany quirks that everyone else has, like Varl's overprotective love of his comic books or Erend's obsession with Donuts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Master Builder</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Horizon looks great in Lego form. Each level is filled with charm, constructed out of smart recreations of familiar structures like dilapidated buildings to climb around or destroyed sections of road mixed with things like a traditional Lego police station. These additions can distract from the Horizon flavor a little, but aren't harmful in their own right as the environments still nail the look and feel overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s especially true of the soundtrack. The music is fantastic, pulling some great choices from Horizon Zero Dawn’s score and adding its own flair with some EDM and pop-inspired tracks. One standout was called Post-Apocalyptic Dance Party, which would feel right at home with songs like Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the design of the levels themselves frequently boil down to just a few key components: linear exploration sections that often hide a few chests full of either Studs or the occasional limited-use rare weapon or gadget, arenas to fight numerous machines and cultists in, and then sometimes a platforming area with simple jumps and climbing paths as you chase a Tallneck to end of the stage. Special Cauldron levels can also have slightly trickier platforming sections that require you to use either some form of shock item or weapon to power movable objects or open doors. While each stage is different, it became clear after just a few hours that the formula is too predictable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a noticeable lack of things to do besides platform and fight – no puzzles to solve, and no sneakily hidden secrets to obtain things that many fans of Lego games have come to expect. For example, red bricks are relegated to just unlocking a few costumes and customization items instead of various cheats as usual, like the stud multiplier or 8-bit music modifier. It’s fine that they serve a different purpose here, but when I know they are usually used for so much more, the unavoidable comparisons come across as lacking.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Piece of Resistance</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Customization picks up some of the slack, and was one of my favorite elements of Lego Horizon Adventures. There are over 100 gold and red bricks to collect for unlockables like costumes and town alterations. You obtain a small portion of them by completing levels, but most are earned by completing tasks on a community board in the hub area, Mother's Heart. The community board encourages you to change your outfits regularly, asking you to do things like dress as various Ninjago characters before defeating enemies with specific elemental attacks, or build certain items in town that let you catch a fish or play fetch with a dog. You can even radically change how Mother’s Heart looks, whether that’s adding hot dog carts, dropping dragons onto rooftops, or dressing all the townsfolk up like ice cream cones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those cosmetic choices, you also have two simple but helpful skill tree options to take advantage of; one is a general skill tree that benefits your whole team, while the other is a set of character-specific trees. The general tree offers benefits like experience bonuses, extra healing, and extending the duration of enemies being frozen, shocked, or on fire. Meanwhile, the character-specific trees offer advantages that increase maximum health, weapon damage, or other unique bonuses. These are all unlocked simply by leveling up after earning experience from defeated enemies, with combat standing as a simple but satisfying exercise in picking off the specific body parts of your machine adversaries. By using Aloy’s Focus to target these body parts, you can change how fights play by doing things like removing the horns of a Broadhead so it hurts itself whenever it collides with objects in the environment. Skills can also come in handy when taking down bosses and stronger enemies, which provide more of a challenge than I was expecting from the Lego series. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Horizon Adventures Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, dying in Lego games costs you some Studs and then puts you right back into the battle – but in Lego Horizon Adventures, death instead sends you back to your previous checkpoint, which is usually the start of an area. I'm torn on whether or not this system is better than the original, as I liked that it left more money in my pocket for customization, but that comes at the cost of having to grab chests and build environmental objects again as I retrace my steps after a death. Either way, the good news is that experience earned and progress in various community board challenges is retained, so dying was still only ever a minor annoyance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if it’s more obnoxious to you, Lego Horizon Adventures has five difficulty options to choose from. The lowest setting has enemies only dealing one or fewer hearts worth of damage, and things scale up well to the highest option, where machines like Corruptors or Thunderjaws could deal five or more hearts per hit, taking me down in as little as one or two swings. I almost always prefer to play on the hardest difficulty setting available, but the tough part about doing so here is the lack of mechanics for dodging attacks. You’ll occasionally get access to the Rush Boots gadget, which allows you to zip around the environment in short bursts, but that brings me to another pain point I have mixed feelings about: the unpredictability of item drops. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Lego Games Unranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Horizon Zero Dawn, equipping weapons with the correct elemental type can make a difficult fight much more manageable. While Lego Horizon Adventures adapts that same idea in the form of limited-use rare weapons and gadgets, which ones you get out of chests or from enemy drops is random for the most part. There are some great options like homing weapons or gravity bombs that pull enemies together before exploding. Weaker machines like broadheads and grazers still have tanks on their back that are vulnerable to one-hit kills with elemental attacks, too, but whether or not you're lucky enough to have it is another story. On the one hand, I like the chaotic nature of using whatever I can find mid-fight. On the other, it would have been nice to be able to select specific rare weapons to some degree, especially because certain challenges require certain weapon types to complete them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s cool that you can at least guarantee you get some item drops by breaking off the back of a Shell-Walker, but you also never know what’s inside or which battles they will appear in. Thankfully, there are a few surefire ways to get special items, like a merchant that typically shows up at the midpoint of each stage with a trio of chests containing three random items or by investing in weapon-based abilities in the skill tree. These can help by making specific items drop more often, as well as one skill that gives you a random rare weapon and gadget at the start of each level. These options help, but they still aren't a perfect solution. Granted, all of the rare weapons you <em>could</em> find are both powerful and fun to use, so there’s no going wrong in a general sense, but thinning out the herd with a precise element can go a long way when five or more enemies spawn into an ongoing battle.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Shift Up has continued to update the game and even added crossover DLC with other video game franchises, most recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nier-automata">Nier: Automata</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stellar Blade November 20 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its financial report, Shift Up said that after Stellar Blade’s launch “sales continued at a stabilized level,” although it failed to provide an updated sales figure. It did, however, provide revenue directly attributed to the game: 25.8 billion won (approx $18.5 million) during the quarter Stellar Blade came out (April to June), and 22.5 billion won (approx $16.1 million) during the company’s third quarter (July to September). That’s a total of 48.4 billion won (approx $34.6 million) as of the end of September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, Shift Up’s other game, mobile action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/goddess-of-victory-nikke">Goddess of Victory: Nikke</a>, makes more money than Stellar Blade (approx $51.9 million during the same two quarters).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game’s popularity,” it said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up plans to keep interest in Stellar Blade on PS5 going until the game launches on PC next year, what it calls the “platform expansion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The release is being considered within 2025,” Shift Up confirmed. “Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Shift Up raised 435 billion won ($320 million) in its first day of trade after an initial public offering. According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-maker-shift-debuts-south-220000910.html?guccounter=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, that was the largest in the country for a gaming company since 2021, when PUBG maker Krafton Inc. raised $3.8 billion from its own IPO. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up has an unannounced multiplatform RPF codenamed Project witches in the works. It said it plans to launch it at some point after 2027, with more information due in the first half of next year. Given the success of Stellar Blade, it seems likely Shift Up is also considering a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Treyarch has shared more details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1, including a look at its battle pass' rather unexpected new skins. These include a 'Raccoon Goon' skin for Niran, some kind of parasitic nightmare for Carver (see header image above) and a shark suit also for Carver, because why not.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team has released a new system for its battle pass, which will now adopt a pages system to replace the sector map. In Treyarch's words, players should think of it all like a book.</p>

<p>"The first Page displays BlackCell Instant Rewards and the second Page shows premium Battle Pass Instant Rewards, followed by 100 in-game Battle Pass rewards across 14 Pages and a Completion Page that is instantly unlocked once all other Pages are completed," it explained, adding these pages include both free and paid content.</p>
<p>As for its content, which the developer noted is pretty ample, highlights include new weapon blueprints (there are 30 of them), those aforementioned operator skins, and some new equipment skins.</p>
<p>Players can get their hands on the premium battle pass for 1100 COD Points, or scoop up the 'Battle Pass Bundle' for 2400 COD Points, "including 20+ Tier Skips".</p>

<p>New leaks have surfaced online claiming that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will soon feature collaborations between Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War.</p>



<p><span>The new leaks have surfaced from several Call of Duty data miners, including&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@CODWarfareForum</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://x.com/Vondyispog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vondyispog</a> on X (formerly Twitter), who general</span>ly have had a good track record of data mining leaks. Such details were soon corroborated by leaker <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1856495650252411297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>, who had apparently heard of such crossovers in January 2024.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of such a collaboration, either. A couple of months ago, rumors circulated from data miners that a Call of Duty X Halo collaboration was intended for Modern Warfare 3, but it was pushed back for unknown reasons. </p>



<p>It is unclear when such collaborations will be available in Black Ops 6, but the recent update added data strings to the game, which could suggest that they’ll be added sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing Halo, DOOM, and Gears of War skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6? Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

			<p>There are certainties in life. Yes, death, we all know about death, and of course, taxes – unless you’re a celebrity with offshore accounts – LEGO should be the third, though. The certainty of stepping on it. The certainty as a parent of finding bits of it in your pockets. And the certainty that no matter your age, you’re likely within a few feet of a piece of it at all times. It’s like rats, but yellow and less bitey.</p>
<p>If that’s an unusual way to start a Lego game review, that’s only because Lego Horizon Adventures is an unusual Lego game.</p>

<p>Previous licensed games tended to be based on huge properties like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Star Wars</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/04/18/lego-the-hobbit-review/">Lord of the Rings</a> and Harry Potter, filled out by Lego’s own brands like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/09/the-lego-ninjago-movie-video-game-review/">Ninjago</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/14/review-lego-city-undercover-wii-u/">Lego City</a>. In a climatic shift, Lego Horizon Adventures is instead based on Guerrilla Games’ Horizon video game series, which thus far has been exclusive to Sony’s own consoles, with a dip of its toes in the frosty PC waters. So, Lego Horizon Adventures presents a lot of firsts, both for Lego, and the Horizon series, and while it’s certainly a step forward, in some places it’s a step back.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures has been developed by Studio Gobo in partnership with Guerrilla Games, Sony preferring to lean on a relatively unknown team – better known for helping to co-develop other big properties than their own titles – than partnering with longtime Lego developer Traveller’s Tales and Warner Bros. In some ways, that’s a good thing. Traveller’s Tales have produced so many Lego titles, that it feels as though it’s hard to innovate within that space, whether through simply knowing what works, or the weight of expectation. Lego Horizon doesn’t have the same preconceptions, though the average gamer on the street may not see it that way.</p>


<p>Lego Horizon Adventures feels more in line with the Lego movies, and there’s certainly a key intent to mimic the fun and frivolous tone of films like The Lego Movie and Lego Batman. The character animations also align with them, so you find a Lego game that feels suitably modern and up-to-date.</p>
<p>That’s also certainly true in the game’s visuals. Lego Horizon Adventures is the best-looking Lego game we’ve seen, each area packed with Lego-filled detail. It’s a shame then that this beautiful setting often feels so lifeless and repetitive. As you progress through the chapters you’ll encounter new areas, and while they’re initially interesting and exciting, they soon become mundane, with fewer and fewer ‘wow’ moments. They are there – my 8-year-old son marvelled with wide eyes at a train hanging from a cliff edge with a scorpion-like robot clutching at it – but overall, it doesn’t make enough of the original game’s post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
<p>They do at least nail the tone for all the family. The two of us regularly chuckled at the conversations between the characters, though often at different bits. If you’ve played Aloy’s previous adventures you’ll enjoy the way that Studio Gobo poke fun at her – “I’m just a girl with a bow” – as well as the way the other main characters are presented, but not knowing them didn’t seem to hurt my son’s enjoyment either. This is still pure family co-op gaming, and though it’s not refreshingly new, it’s reassuringly reliable.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures is very linear, which starts to hurt your enjoyment the longer you spend with it. There’s little to none of the light puzzle-solving the previous Lego games have been known for, and while there is building, it’s not useful in any way, beyond firing some studs at you as a reward. Even my son noted that the building and the treasure chests were notably worse than the last Lego game, The Skywalker Saga. And he’s eight.</p>
<p>The only real place that you feel some of that creative magic is in your home hub of Mother’s Heart. The steadily expanding village lets you add a progressively more outlandish array of decorations, while customising and building new houses and plots. Alongside the expected Horizon designs, you can spend your studs on decorations that draw from other Lego franchises, though you’re limited to Ninjago, Lego City and Lego itself. It’s pretty fun seeing Aloy appear in cutscenes as a punk rocker or a hot dog, but it’s more of an fun aside rather than an essential distraction.</p>

<p>Throughout the game, the true focus is on the combat, and Lego Horizon Adventures does at least get that right. Aloy’s bow is accurate and destructive, while other characters like Teersa can fill the screen with exploding chickens. Using your Focus, you can highlight enemies’ weak spots, and hitting them rewards you with a massive dose of damage. Fans of the series will enjoy seeing the different creatures in their Lego-fied forms, and they lose none of their impact or viciousness despite being made of plastic. You can really crank the difficulty up too, and while Normal mode was suitable for an 8-year-old, if you’re coming to it as an adult there’s plenty of challenge to push you to the edge.</p>

					<p>Sony’s Horizon franchise has always felt like it had the potential to tap into a younger demographic, what with its plucky youthful protagonist, largely bloodless robot dino combat, and environmental messaging, but Sony never really pitched the games that hard toward kids – until now. This week sees the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which reassembles 2017’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> into a plastic-y kid-friendly form.</p>
<p>Will Lego Horizon Adventures attract a whole new audience to Aloy’s exploits? Or does Sony’s arrow fall short of the intended target? Time to break this blocky adventure down.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures sticks to the broad strokes laid down by Horizon Zero Dawn, in the sense that you play as a redhead named Aloy with a mysterious past who has to save a world overrun by aggressive robo dinos and fanatical cultists. Beyond that, most of the original game’s complex backstory involving competing AIs, cloning, and other sci-fi chicanery has been jettisoned, presumable to keep this game approachable for younger players. Hearing Ashly Burch and other original HZD cast members (<a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feature-sylens-recast-following-lance-reddicks-untimely-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minus Lance Reddick, sadly</a>) doing poppy kid-friendly versions of their characters is interesting, and the plot being boiled all the way down to “you have to stop Helis because he hates trees” is amusing in a way, but <em>so</em> much has been sanded down in this retelling that the story becomes rather uninteresting.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While this version of Horizon Zero Dawn’s story isn’t that compelling, the franchise’s world still looks very impressive done up with Lego. The makers of Lego Horizon Adventures went with a fixed isometric camera, which allows them to pack every inch of the screen with a huge amount of detail and plenty of flashy effects, including ray tracing. The game offers the choice of a 30fps Fidelity mode and 60fps Performance mode on PS5, with both running very consistently, even with tons of stuff flying around on screen.</p>
<p>That said, while the isometric approach allows for lavish visuals, it doesn’t necessarily serve the core gameplay that well. True to the original Horizon games, Aloy largely fights with a bow in Lego Horizon Adventures, but ranged combat has never got along with isometric camera angles very well. This is particularly true in this game, where you’re constantly having to aim at machines’ glowing weak spots. There are varying levels of aim assistance you can turn on, but playing as Aloy and most of her friends never feels as precise or enjoyable as it should.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures5-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I say <em>most</em> of her friends, as playable characters Aloy, Varl, and Teersa all use ranged attacks, but Erend, who isn't unlocked until nearly halfway through the game, wields a big ol’ melee hammer. Playing as Erend feels more impactful and gratifying than any other character, but even he’s not perfect, as it's pretty clear Lego Horizon Adventures was largely designed around ranged combat, with almost every enemy scooting around quickly and spamming long-range attacks. I still preferred taking control of Erend, but there's no ideal, fully satisfying character to play as.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures’ core gameplay not quite stacking up is frustrating, as the game definitely does some things right. A lot is borrowed from the core Horizon games, most notably the series’ large array of enemy machines with unique attack patterns and weaknesses. Add a variety of unique weapons and gadgets, interactive environments, and throwable explosives to the mix and you get combat encounters that are much more complex than your typical Lego game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Almost <em>too</em> complex for the game's less-experienced target audience. Lego Horizon Adventures throws a lot at you and playing on medium difficulty, I actually saw the Game Over screen a decent number of times. There are a variety of difficulties to choose from, but younger kids may find even the lower levels a bit overwhelming. Of course, there is a drop-in co-op feature so parents can lend a hand, and you should prepare to be called in to assist more often than you would with your typical Lego game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFlegohorizonadventures7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In between combat, Lego Horizon Adventures doesn’t offer all that much. Level design is very linear and repetitive, with players simply following the trail of studs along a narrow path to the next objective. Occasionally, there will be a short branching side path with a cache of studs or something to build at the end of it, but that's about as complex as things get.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really <em>want</em> more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures carries over a lot of the things previous Horizon games did well, offering lush visuals, a likable cast, and a wide range of robo dinos to take down. Unfortunately, not everything survived blockification, with an overly-simplified story, sometimes-unsatisfying core gameplay, bland level design, and an overall lack of content resulting in a Lego game that’s a few bricks shy of a load.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil 9 is going to feature two unkillable stalker enemies and a Resident Evil 4-inspired atmosphere, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BiohazardDeclassified" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biohazard Declassified</a> and reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, the new entry in the series, which has yet to be fully revealed, will feature two series mainstays as playable characters—Jill Valentine and Leon Kenney—who were the main focus of two playtests held in April and September.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil 9 April 2024 playtest was focused on Jill Valentine and was set in an abandoned hospital on an island. The main objective was navigating this hospital, which was decorated with a moon with an infinity symbol sigil representing a cult, to find a serum that would fight the infection affecting the residents, mold-infected zombies, which fought with a variety of weapons such as knives, axes, and scythes. Jill was also armed with some standard series weapons like a shotgun, pistol, and knife and had the ability to craft ammo using other items. She was also being pursued by an unkillable stalker enemy called the Goatman, who eventually manages to catch her and infect her at the end of the playtest. Assisting Jill via radio are Chris Redfield and Barry Burton.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil 9 September 2024 playtest, on the other hand, was focused on Leon Kennedy and was set on a beach leading into a forest close to Mr. Simon's lab, which Leon is pursuing as he is supposedly creating bioweapon clones of Evelyn. During the journey, Leon had to fight zombies armed with multiple weapons and avoid another unkillable stalker enemy, a witch with the ability to transform into flies and cause hallucinations. Leon also has the chance to witness zombies praying to the moon by a bonfire, a scene that is likely connected to the cult represented by the moon symbol seen in Jill's story.</p>
<p><iframe title="RESIDENT EVIL 9 || NEW LEAKS | PLAYTEST GAMEPLAY DETAILS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ARboFcEUfLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All the supposed playtest information detailed above suggests that Resident Evil 9 will have a pretty big Resident Evil 4 influence, which wouldn't be surprising considering how the fourth entry in the series continues to be an incredibly popular game and how well last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">remake</a> has been received. As the game is rumored to have a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/">open-world</a> feel, it will be interesting to see how the development team will manage to blend these gameplay elements, if true, with a more open gameplay flow and progression.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. According to rumors, it should be released in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rumor-resident-evil-9-reportedly-launching-in-second-half-of-2025/">second half of 2025</a>, so a proper announcement shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-a-lego-icon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego has been a staple of gaming for as long as I can remember. From the early days on the PC with games like <em>Lego Island</em>, to the more modernized takes we see today based on popular franchise IPs such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga" rel="nofollow"><em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em></a>, there’s no doubt Lego continues to thrive.</p>

<p>Their latest adventure cozies up to Sony’s own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review-merging-past-future-into-great-present" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, focusing on a video game story rather than an existing movie or TV show. We know that the idea first came from Lego’s people, so it’s interesting to see that they were the ones who wanted to explore doing something with Horizon beyond its own game and existing Lego sets.</p>

<p>Thus, we have <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, developed in partnership by both Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.</p>

<p>When I first saw this game, I couldn’t help but ask myself: just who is this for? Is it for fans of Lego? Is it for fans of <em>Horizon</em>? After getting a chance to play it, I’d say the answer is something more in between.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-01.jpg?itok=pGOUVv5a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-01.jpg?itok=rrsqcW9g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Similar to <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> tells the story of a machine hunter named Aloy, who has to set out, gather a crew of characters, and discover her past. All of this is framed by a world settled in the far future – and most importantly, Lego bricks.</p>

<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is at its core a new spin on the existing story we know from <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, but truncated and retold with Lego’s typical sarcastic and oftentimes whimsical humor. Whether or not that works for you is going to depend a lot on how much you connect to Aloy and her friends, and want to see them in a more humorous environment.</p>

<p>On my end, I thought it was a cute way to get those who have played the original <em>Horizon</em> up to speed, but also fun to see these characters break out of their more serious setting. While Aloy and friends lean into a lot of jokes, the antagonist has also been exaggerated to a comical degree, which is to be expected from Lego's usual brand of humor. My only gripe is that they did cut out a lot along the way of adapting the story for a different format. Perhaps that won't be too much of an issue for newcomers.</p>

<p>As for how everything else works out, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> sheds the original game’s open world, and in its place is a series of linear levels that must be completed to advance the story.</p>

<p>Each level consists of a different type of environment, such as mountains, a desert, or the jungle, and Aloy, or one of her companions selected at the beginning of each mission, will be allowed to explore it. You can even hook up another controller and play on-screen co-op, which allows more than just a single character to interact with the set pieces.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-02.jpg?itok=Oox1KaxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-02.jpg?itok=6HokTK8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These linear levels are structured so that the characters can platform through them – climbing up bricks, destroying objects to collect a currency known as studs, and building structures such as ziplines or the iconic <em>Horizon</em> towers.</p>

<p>Scattered throughout each level, Aloy will come across various enemies, and these all have their own special gimmick to them. With a variety of weapons and gadgets at her disposal, highlighted weak spots on each enemy in yellow will help Aloy take them down quickly.</p>

<p>There’s actually a good amount of variety here, which surprised me. This isn’t like <em>Lego Star Wars</em> where you spent most of the time slapping someone with a lightsaber. In <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, there are a lot of different weapons you can play with, and those playstyles extend to the other characters as well. For example, Aloy can equip a flame bow that causes elemental damage, or a bow that fires multiple arrows. The variety helps mix things up when different enemies are about.</p>

<p>While I found myself using Aloy often for her witty banter and access to ranged items, Varl’s ability to use spears was fun for a pure melee approach. It helps break up some of the monotony too, because largely, the linear level approach remains the same throughout.</p>

<p>Aside from that, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> features the Mother’s Heart location from the Horizon games as a sort of hub. Here, you can regroup after each level, and purchase items using the stud currency to build and customize what a lot of this area looks like. The neat thing here is you can purchase classic Lego items too from Ninjago and Lego City, just to name a few.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-03.jpg?itok=-8KxwVeC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-03.jpg?itok=rpuqcQTG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are also smaller quests here on a notice board Aloy can pick up, which amount to things like killing so many of a type of enemy, defeating them using elemental abilities, and more. They’re just little extra tasks that can earn more currency, which Aloy will get in loads anyway from simply playing the game.</p>

<p>Additionally, Aloy can take on Apex Machines – further side quests that involve powerful enemies and help break up the pacing of the story. These quests are still available after completing the main quest, so there’s no real pressure to collect everything at once.</p>

<p>I think what impressed me the most with <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, was the presentation. This is far and away the best Lego has looked to date, with plenty of colors, and the material of the characters and environments looks exactly how you expect Lego to look in real life. Everything is voiced with many of the voice actors returning - it's a solid effort.</p>

<p>It’s clear the development team put a lot of thought into how everything should look, and much of what people loved about <em>Horizon</em> is recreated here seamlessly. The machines are probably my favorite part – what with real kits for some of them already out there. It’s pretty easy to see why this game got the greenlight.</p>

<p>Whether you're a big <em>Horizon</em> fan or not, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> can at least provide some entertainment for both crowds. It's a different way to get into the series for sure, but if you're already a big fan, there's a lot to be had with these characters and the Lego brand of humor. If anything, they've certainly provided a strong template for future Lego games, <em>Horizon</em> or otherwise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sultans-game-is-a-dark-fascinating-and-irrepressibly-horny-oddity<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>I predict I likely won’t have fully gotten to grips with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sultans-game">Sultan’s Game</a> for several more hours, but since I’m considering investing that time - after a morning spent card shuffling and deciding whomst to bone and whomst to murder in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169680/Sultans_Game_Demo/">Steam demo</a> - I’m compelled to spotlight it. It’s deeply imperfect and willfully obtuse, but also absolutely fascinating. I’ll ground you with a slightly wonky and dull allusion to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a>, then guide you through in more or less the order I experienced it. As we progress, you may feel steadily more disorientated. It’ll be like a brewery tour I’ve somehow inherited control of by murder-boning the previous owners. Onward!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The art itself is gorgeous, sitting somewhere between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>’s multi-hued, drive-by horniness and Yoshitaka Amano’s <a href="https://youtu.be/5aoIZtg-isY">1001 Nights</a>, and the soundtrack also does a great job scene setting. For the tutorial - which, I must add, is only really a tutorial for about 30% of the game - you take control of the Sultan. He’s bored of all earthly pleasures, until one day a magician arrives at the door with a box of cards. The cards come in four flavours: carnality, bloodshed, conquest, and extravagance. Each also has a value like 'gold' or 'silver'. To fulfil a card, you need to find a target of equal value to enact it upon. There’s also an option to attempt to bone the tutorial magician, which I picked <em>out of</em> <em>curiosity only</em>. It doesn’t work, anyway.</p>

<p>That the Sultan is a real piece of shit is something I picked up around the time he snapped the neck of the consort with whom he resolved his initial 'carnality' card. The next I got was a gold 'bloodshed' card, which meant I had to personally murder a gold tier character from my court. As you quickly realise, your courtiers here are resources, There’s an almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>-ish efficient tyranny to it all. Many resource management games use some sort of population-as-spendables system, but both the art and the focus in the writing here mean that you do get at least some sense of these characters as people before you 'spend' them on whatever sordid goal the card demands.</p><p>Somewhat mercifully, you don’t actually play as the Sultan after the tutorial, although he is a constant presence. You make a character with a small entourage and an estate on the embroidered map you’ll use to visit various locations and events, and then you’ll draw your first card. You’ve got seven days to resolve it before the Sultan executes you. Once you’ve resolved that card, you get a fresh seven day grace period re: getting your head cut off.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is where it gets a little complicated, but very broadly, it’s a narrative worker placement game. Your main goal is to turn up whatever event will let you use your card, and in doing so, you’ll end up progressing through little story chains. For an early bloodshed card, I had to convince a dude to like me by gifting him a book, which I bought with cash I earned for having my wife watch my estate. But she also had a high 'wisdom' stat, so I was left wondering if she wouldn’t have been better deployed to the Sultan’s palace to keep an eye on the politicking there. You’re not only trying to resolve cards, but you’ve also got separate trackers for your reputation and influence in the city. Bonus cards like ploys or, say, expensive perfume to use while spying the bathhouse can net you some nice buffs, which usually come in the form of rerolls for other events.</p>
<p>As you can likely tell - it’s a lot. Such a lot that I can’t even fully quantify it’s lot-ness for lack of an adequate reference point for how lot-erly it expands, and how this theoretical lot contains and contextualises all the assorts lot-ness within it. Still, despite only grasping about 90% of the prose due to various translation errors, I think there’s enough here for a tenuous recommendation, providing you’re not too put off by the close proximity in which murder and boning are usually found. It’s very dark, but it also feels very vibrant with ideas. At this early point, at least, there’s a very exciting sense of not knowing quite how deep Sultan’s Game goes, which is one of the Best Videogame Things, imo.</p>

            <p>
The boss of EA - publisher of EA Sports FC, Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and Dragon Age - is reportedly in the frame to replace Disney CEO Bob Iger. 
</p>
<p>
A new report by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-explores-wider-field-of-candidates-to-succeed-iger-d1876792">The Wall Street Journal</a> states that EA CEO Andrew Wilson is among the top candidates currently being considered as a long-term replacement for Iger, who oversees all of Disney.
</p>
<p>
Iger is expected to leave Disney in 2026, after steering the company for more than 15 years. His tenure has seen the firm acquire Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and much of 21st Century Fox, launch Disney+ and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">sign a $1.5bn deal with Fortnite maker Epic Games</a>.

<figcaption>Wilson formerly served as boss of the FIFA/EA Sports FC franchise.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBM2xyco_Kg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The Australian-born Wilson has meanwhile served 24 years at EA to date and, while press conferences from the publisher are rarer these days, is the company's most prominent face. Wilson stepped up to become EA's CEO in 2013, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-riccitiello-out-as-ceo-of-ea">the resignation of the controversial John Riccitiello</a>.
</p><p>Wilson's time at EA includes years working as the boss of the FIFA franchise and then all of EA Sports, as the company raked in vast revenues from Ultimate Team and ultimately signed divorce papers with FIFA itself. Last year, Wilson re-organised EA into two distinct operations - EA Sports and everything else - dubbed EA Entertainment.</p>
<p>
Iger, meanwhile, who turns 74 in February, is currently on his second stint at Disney. His initial retirement in 2021 lasted just a year, before he returned due to the firing of his successor Bob Chapek.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for comment. 
</p>
<p>So how is this year's FIFA - uh, EA Sports FC? "This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Adam Williams, former lead writer of Star Wars Eclipse at Quantic Dream, has announced a new game development studio called <a href="https://www.republicgames.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republic Games</a>. To kickstart the enterprise, he received funding from KRAFTON, maker of PUBG and The Callisto Protocol. Their first game will be a dark and mature fantasy roleplaying game set in a world that somehow blends Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Orwell's 1984. In a statement, Williams said:</p>
<p><em>A tyrannical regime is brutally enforcing its ideology and crushing all dissent. But a faction of rebels seeks to overturn the tyrants and expose the lies at the heart of their doctrine.</em></p>
<p><em>We founded Republic Games to make entertaining and meaningful experiences. We're only focused on giving players what they actually want: great gameplay, great story, inspiring characters, and a fantasy experience they will remember. We believe there’s a broad base of RPG gamers who feel they aren’t being catered to anymore. They want a classic, traditional, timeless fantasy. They want a story that responds to their choices, giving them the freedom to go in any direction they want - rather than being told what to think about the story and characters. That’s the audience we’re making this for.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GcMgCNRWQAMFA_7-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before his work on Star Wars Eclipse, Adam Williams was also the lead writer on Quantic Dream's previous game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/detroit-become-human-do-humans-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Detroit: Become Human</a>. Two actors featured in that game, Bryan and Amelia Dechart (who played Connor and Traci, respectively), have <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/1856071335728033850" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> they'll return in this new fantasy RPG.</p>
<p>As for Star Wars Eclipse, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from Quantic Dream that the project was simmering. That was in September 2023. Previous rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a 2026 launch, although a delay to 2027 is reportedly not out of the realm of possibility.</p>

			<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that a PC version of Stellar Blade was on the way, but now Korean developer Shift Up has confirmed that we can expect it to arrive at some point in 2025. The news comes from the latest investor <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, in which the studio also revealed that its sales estimate for the PC version is higher than the PS5's, considering Steam's large user base and the recent explosive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success </a>of a similar action game, Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Shift Up is also planning to expand overseas with a new office to be established in Los Angeles. The company certainly has a lot to invest after the big <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPO</a> worth $320 million they raised in July. However, they also have an ongoing lawsuit to deal with regarding the Stellar Blade IP, as the owner of StellarBlade.com <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> both Shift Up and Sony for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio continues to improve the game. The recent PS5 Pro update <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-playstation-5-pro-max-graphic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> the new Pro and Pro Max graphics presets, both of which support high frame rates. Next week, players can expect a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-photo-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> adding Photo Mode and a DLC collaboration with Square Enix's NieR Automata. All of these patches and DLCs are almost assuredly going to be available from day one on PC.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade got a straight 9 in Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PS5 version penned by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <p>A stupid inside joke I had with a housemate once was asking each other if we were "born in Chornobyl?" as a play on "were you born in a barn?" whenever either of us left the lights on before leaving the flat. This doesn’t make too much sense now I think about it, but such things rarely do. A more accurate jab, in hindsight, might have been "you been running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> at full specs or something?", because based on the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>’s new system requirements, you’re going to need a reasonably laissez-faire attitude to literally any other concern in your life that doesn’t involve acquiring a notably juice-guzzling rig.</p>

"We, as Ukrainians, have our own identity," said Grygorovych. "We identify ourselves as Ukrainians. We have a totally different story and identity than other countries around us, and for us. Historically, we’ve been a very rebellious nation, with a lot of revolutions, and those revolutions were mostly moved by the will to be free, and to get more freedom."</p>

            <p>The studio behind sunny third-person adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rime">Rime</a> and time loop murder mystery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a> has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers-tequila-cancel-game-and-lay-off-staff">cancelled a game last month</a> and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Founders Raúl Rubio and Luz Sancho have left their positions at the company following the insolvency filing, leaving it in the hands of former Chief Operating Officer Térence Mosca, who is now acting as general manager. Mosca says the insolvency is the result of "prolonged market conditions".</p>
<p>"Since its founding in 2009, Tequila Works' game-development philosophy has always focused on 'creating things with gusto'," he said in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency">a statement to Gameindustry.biz</a>. "We are doing everything we can to provide support and guidance to our teams during this difficult time."</p>
<p>But remaining workers are still expected to "fulfil their responsibilities" according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.es/la-desarrolladora-espanola-tequila-works-declara-bancarrota">sources Eurogamer.es spoke to</a> (translated via Google). I'm not sure what responsibilities really matter under these conditions, especially when the studio concedes they may not be in a position to pay the salaries of those workers. But that's the line management seem to be putting out.</p>
<p>The layoffs last month saw the axing of "a small number of roles" the studio said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tequilaworks_with-deep-regret-we-must-inform-activity-7249379290159452160-vRKo/?originalSubdomain=es">post on LinkedIn</a>, which also announced the cancellation of that unannounced game. They noted it was "an incredibly difficult time" at the studio. In 2022 Tencent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-buy-majority-stake-in-rime-and-song-of-nunu-developers">became a majority shareholder</a> of the company, which was welcomed by studio management at the time. But in this instance, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">corporate consolidation</a> has not helped the studio in the long term.

</p><p>Aside from the human cost of all this, it means a studio who made some great games will now likely soon be dust. "I've had such a splendid time with Rime," said John (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rime-review">our review</a>, "[and] so deeply enjoyed its expansive and sumptuous world." And Alice B (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-the-sexy-brutale">once called</a> The Sexy Brutale "a very clever interlocking thing of beauty". </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I really liked <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, a game that’s exactly what it sounds like. It tells an embellished version of the events of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-graphics-screenshot-1851676141&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-graphics-screenshot-1851676141"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a></span>,<em> </em>the first game in Guerrilla’s series of post-apocalyptic open-world adventures,<em> </em>with colorful Lego bricks and the slapstick humor you’d expect from a lovingly made YouTube parody, all wrapped up in a simple but sometimes challenging platformer. But it’s also such a strange experiment by Sony and developer Guerrilla Games that I’m curious as to why <em>Horizon </em>was the series the PlayStation gods decreed should get a spin-off built in Legos.</p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>’ strangest twist to <em>Horizon</em>’s world concerns its main character, Aloy, as she’s a bit of an odd fit for the otherwise cheery and bright world of Lego adaptations. The bow-wielding protagonist of nearly every piece of <em>Horizon </em>media is often characterized as stoic, stubborn, and maybe even a little curt toward people struggling to make sense of a world that is rapidly changing. The Aloy minifigure of <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, by contrast, is a silly little gal who’s just happy to be here. I get the tone shift from super-serious action RPG to family-friendly platformer, but I was surprised Guerrilla didn’t go the <em>Lego Batman </em>route of playing up Aloy’s seriousness against a more comical backdrop.</p><figure id="" data-id="d18998c0adfb4e361b0158e94982f0aa" data-recommend-id="image://d18998c0adfb4e361b0158e94982f0aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Erend approaches a robotic dinosaur." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Erend approaches a robotic dinosaur." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d18998c0adfb4e361b0158e94982f0aa" data-recommend-id="image://d18998c0adfb4e361b0158e94982f0aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Erend approaches a robotic dinosaur." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The upshot of losing Aloy’s broody demeanor is that <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is a genuine hoot. The game effectively spoofs the post-apocalyptic, lore-driven story that fans have come to know and love by poking fun at just how silly it all sounds when you try and describe it to someone who doesn’t play these games. I admire just how willing Guerrilla was to strip the story of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>down<em>&nbsp;</em>to its barest parts, taking none of it seriously. There are some good bits, banter, and buffoonery between shooting Aloy’s blocky bow or swinging Erend’s Lego-on-a-stick. I forget how endearing <em>Horizon</em>’s characters can be when I’m not playing one of these games, and even these exaggerated imitations reminded me that I am at least a little bit attached to Aloy and her friends.</p><p>Though I have my questions and quibbles about how <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>chose to exaggerate the personalities of its characters, when I’m fighting robot dinosaurs made up of Lego blocks, I see the vision behind the whole game. <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>adapts <em>Horizon</em>’s concepts into the usual <em>Lego </em>game structure pretty well. Seeing Aloy and friends turn into blocky blades of red grass as they move through different patches to hide from enemies made me chuckle, but striking foes in weak points and watching them break off like they would in any <em>Horizon</em> game is when <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>clicked. It’s still got a lot of the collectathon platformer dressings of most <em>Lego </em>games, and most of its platforming is pretty bog standard and unremarkable, but there was care taken here to make it feel like a <em>Horizon</em> game.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6bef6062e8ae1015cd421ceeff286e4" data-recommend-id="image://d6bef6062e8ae1015cd421ceeff286e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy stands on top of a tallneck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aloy stands on top of a tallneck." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6bef6062e8ae1015cd421ceeff286e4" data-recommend-id="image://d6bef6062e8ae1015cd421ceeff286e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy stands on top of a tallneck." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though the fights don’t feel as dire and overwhelming in scale as those in the main <em>Horizon</em> games do, the same basic principles from <em>Zero Dawn </em>and <em>Forbidden West</em> still apply. Most of <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> has you running through blocky recreations of Guerrilla’s world, almost exclusively broken up by encounters with hordes of foes that are easy enough to handle in one-on-one duels, but can become chaotic, and even challenging, when they gang up on you. As they do in other <em>Horizon </em>games, each robot has specific weak points to target and break off for extra damage, but it’s not until you reach some of the higher-ranking foes that this kind of precision feels necessary. Otherwise, it’s just about firing arrows in the general direction of an enemy, but there are enough tools and different playstyles between characters to shake things up. Some of these are ripped right out of <em>Horizon</em>, such as the tripwires that are evocative of the Tripcaster in the main games. However, there are also some weirder inclusions, like a hot dog stand that throws explosives around a small area—which, sure, is nice to have, but also felt out of place in a game that usually feels focused on paying tribute to the source material. And that identity issue doesn’t just begin and end at the lethal hot dog stand.</p><p>Though <em>Horizon</em> fingerprints are all over this game as you’d expect, there are also other cross-universe Lego promotions in <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, and those can be pretty jarring. Why is Aloy able to wear <em>Ninjago </em>costumes and engage in other cross-promo silliness? Is that part of the deal of being a <em>Lego </em>game? Is every property set in some kind of multiverse full of other properties spilling buckets of blocks onto each other? It’s a small nitpick in the grand scheme of things, because when <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>commits to the bit of parodying <em>Horizon</em>, it’s at its most enjoyable.</p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is a fun little experiment, one that I wouldn’t be surprised to see Sony do again if this takes off. Could it become a trend for Sony, which has gotten so risk-averse with its big franchises, to create more <em>Lego </em>parodies of its biggest names? Maybe. I would be thrilled to see something like <em>Lego God of War</em> poke fun at Kratos and Atreus’ dysfunctional father/son relationship. <em>Horizon </em>feels like such an oddball pick for a <em>Lego </em>game that I can’t imagine this being just a one-off made to fill the gap between 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470"><em>Forbidden West</em></a></span><em> </em>and whatever’s next.</p><p>Sony is leaning harder into franchise development by expanding its games onto other platforms and even into other mediums <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-level-amazon-armored-core-playstation-keanu-1851627812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-level-amazon-armored-core-playstation-keanu-1851627812">like film and television</a></span> these days. The cynic in me could easily call this a play to expand <em>Horizon</em> and other series into additional avenues of revenue. <em>Horizon </em>already has Lego sets to buy, and brand synergy gets money flowing faster than you can say “tie-in toy.” At the very least, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures </em>feels like a game made with a lot of love for the property it’s based on rather than a cynical cash grab. Whatever comes next, I can at least say that.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-ceo-of-disney/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-ceo-could-be-the-next-top-boss-at-disney.1034388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-ceo-of-disney/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that Electronic Arts’ CEO, Andrew Wilson, is being considered for the role of CEO at Disney and could replace Bob Iger, who has been in the role (on and off) since 2005. In 2026, the figurehead’s contract will expire and Disney is looking for a suitable replacement – and Andrew Wilson is leading the pack.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-ea-to-disney">From EA To Disney</h2>



<p>Per a report from the Wall Street Journal, the head honcho at Electronic Arts is being sized up for the CEO position at Disney. It was claimed that several people are being considered for the role:</p>



<ul>
<li>Andrew Wilson, CEO at EA</li>



<li>Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman</li>



<li>Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, Disney Entertainment co-chairs</li>



<li>Josh D’Amaro, Disney Experiences Chairman</li>
</ul>



<p>Andrew Wilson has been climbing the ranks at Electronic Arts for almost a quarter of a century, having joined way back in 2000. He has been the CEO of the firm since 2013, through many of the company’s highest highs and lowest lows.</p>



<p>In recent years, Disney has been making bold pushes into the world of gaming. In February, the company bought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>, and a couple of years ago, the firm stressed that it wanted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-every-6-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Star Wars game</a> on the market every six months. </p>



<p>In 2023, Bob Iger was advised to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/10/11/disney-execs-want-to-buy-ea-and-become-a-gaming-giant-19645298/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invest heavily in gaming</a> and acquire a leading publisher or development office, and Electronic Arts was at the front of that discussion. For a while, there was a goal for Disney to become ‘a gaming giant’, but Iger wasn’t agreeable to the mission.</p>



<p>With Andrew Wilson at the helm, could we see Disney become an indomitable gaming powerhouse?</p>
