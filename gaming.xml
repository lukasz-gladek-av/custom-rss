			<p>It’s been over a decade since the original release of The Talos Principle, Croteam’s massively successful and critically acclaimed first person puzzle game. While the gameplay of the original and the philosophical narrative woven around it still holds up, the game is definitely looking its age compared to current releases, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/01/the-talos-principle-2-review/">its sequel</a>. To remedy this, Croteam have reworked the original into a gorgeous Unreal 5 showcase, and added some new content for longterm fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Talos Principle: Reawakened | Become a Creator | Coming April 10 | Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQdEC6R-eAY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the original game, Reawakened also includes the expansion Road to Gehenna and a brand new chapter called In the Beginning which serves as a prologue to the events of the main game and takes you back to the very first test of the Simulation (the world in which the game takes place). With 15 hours of content in the main game, 7 for the Road to Gehenna, and 5 or 6 for the new content there is plenty of puzzling goodness to be found here, with even more playtime for completionists.</p>


<p>Newcomers to the series might well be asking, ‘Ok, but what is The Talos Principle?’ Well, what you have here is one of the most thought-provoking and philosophical gaming narratives ever written. Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes took all the best aspects of serious science fiction writing and combined them with a wide range of philosophy to produce an interrogation of being and meaning that perfectly complements the immersive puzzling. You begin by waking up in a weird and paradoxical world made up of classical architectural ruins and futuristic technology. A booming voice from a being who calls themselves Elohim sends you forth to explore and discover your true purpose.</p>
<p>This narrative pushes you through more than 120 individual puzzles and is effortlessly conveyed through a combination of voiced cutscenes and datalogs found in the many computer terminals scattered around the landscape. The questioning of technological breakthroughs and their effects on the meaning of humanity feel even more topical now than they did ten years ago – as is the case with all great science fiction.</p>


<p>Graphically, Reawakened is fantastic. The sacrifice here is that it will require a far more powerful system, but still one that is in keeping with ten years of hardware progression. Unreal 5 can be a tricky engine to master, but Croteam have done a fantastic job here with no real bugs or graphical issues in my time with the game. The extra complexity in lighting and atmosphere really adds to the game’s overall effect, especially given the importance of the former to many of the puzzles.</p>
<p>The open-ended structure from the original game is maintained as you can freely choose the order in which you tackle puzzles, with progression between the main stages requiring a specific set of shapes to be collected but not necessarily all of those available. This means that getting stuck on a puzzle is rarely a game-breaking obstacle as you can go and do other ones and come back to it if necessary. This ease of progression is a real benefit and prevents the frustration that many puzzle games suffer from when you get stuck.</p>

<p>Early puzzles are very simple and revolve around you using a signal jammer to force open gateways or turn off security turrets in order to collect the Tetris-like shapes in each level. As the game progresses, however, more complex combinations of jammers, light reflectors, blocks, and more come into play. While some puzzles seem unfathomably difficult at first, the nature of the level design means that you can break them down section by section and fine-tune your ideas until you solve them. They can require a degree of timing due to moving obstacles and robotic enemies, but even these reward thought over dexterity.</p>
<p>There are some quality of life improvements bundled in, a new rewind mechanic letting you revert the last few seconds if you’ve made a small mistake, and the time recorder now having checkpoints to help with sequencing actions together.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting new addition to the Reawakened package is a fully functional puzzle editor which will enable the modding community to create new worlds and puzzles, effectively ensuring that The Talos Principle becomes endless. While I’ve never been one for level design myself, I look forward to seeing what comes out of this community and it looks like Croteam are excited to see what happens too.</p>

			<p>The Talos Principle is one of video game's most well-known happy accidents. Before its release, players knew developer Croteam for their Serious Sam games. Each Serious Sam game couldn't be any further from the kind of game that The Talos Principle is.</p>
<p>That's why it was no surprise to me when I learned that development for The Talos Principle began as development for a new Serious Sam game. Basic puzzle elements featured in The Talos Principle were conceived as a way of navigating the war-torn world of Serious Sam and eventually morphed into what became the 2014 puzzle game.</p>
<p>More than a decade later and a year after a full-blown sequel, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a>, a remaster of the original game and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/">Road to Gehenna</a> expansion, plus a new expansion called In the Beginning. This remaster is more than just a new set of levels. Everything has been given an Unreal Engine 5-style facelift, with better lighting and textures to provide you with even better-looking scenery while you blankly gaze at a puzzle you're stuck on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>There's also a new puzzle editor that lets you create your own puzzles, though admittedly, I did not get to try that out while reviewing the game on PS5. The puzzle editor is only available on the game's PC version, though Croteam has already stated on the game's Steam page that it'll try working the puzzle editor into the console versions of the game post-launch.</p>
<p>I most enjoyed the developer commentary out of all the new additions in this remaster. For context, just like how The Talos Principle was born out of a happy accident, so was my playing it. As a fan of puzzle games, it remained one of my blind spots in the genre. I'd heard plenty about it over the years and been told to play it by some friends, but I never got around to it.</p>
<p>That's why I was intrigued to review it when the opportunity came, because pretty much by accident, I got to have my first experience with The Talos Principle be the best version of the game so far, complete with the kind of developer insights I love to hear about while playing something calm and meditative. In more ways than I could have expected, The Talos Principle is precisely my kind of game, and I should have listened to my friends sooner.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-3-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Playing through The Talos Principle and the Road to Gehenna expansion for the first time, I experienced many of the same feelings players had 11 years ago. Some puzzles made me feel like an absolute genius when I solved them, while others were so easy to solve that I could run through them, doing whatever came to my head first without taking my finger off the sprint button. Not a contemplative moment was had in many a puzzle, and that kind of power fantasy only gets you so far in puzzle games before you get bored.</p>
<p>Then, all at once, towards the end, plenty of puzzles had me in that blank gaze for longer than I care to admit. Re-treading steps I'd already done that didn't work the first time, to see if something would click into place. And when it finally did, I was relieved, instead of thrilled, to move on to the next puzzle, which is not the feeling you want to have when playing a puzzle game.</p>
<p>This also comes down to the lack of new mechanics in The Talos Principle. I got tired of connecting lasers much faster than, say, opening portals. But by the time I was deciding whether to climb the tower, my motivation to continue hinged more on uncovering the story than it did on solving another laser puzzle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Playing through the original game and its expansion also meant that I was experiencing the story of The Talos Principle for the first time, which also felt like its own puzzle. Discussing the meaning of life or trying to define personhood and consciousness sounds like a conversation I might have with a friend over coffee. This is another reason why The Talos Principle is my kind of game.</p>
<p>I loved the writing throughout, and tired as the trope may be, it's likely not a shock to you at this point that I love rooting through cryptic notes and audio logs to piece together a game's story. It makes my experience with a game feel all the more unique. Even if I'm acquiring every piece of the narrative in the same order another player did, there's no way for me to know that. On that note, I was disappointed that the narrative and the puzzles never weaved into one another in interesting ways.</p>
<p>The QR code notes helped make some humorous connections at times, but otherwise, my conversations with Milton felt separate from the rest of the game, which detracted from the experience. Road to Gehenna changes that, with the object of the puzzles being to free other robots from their prison. The newly added In the Beginning expansion includes more storytelling from Alexandra Drennan, which again helps to weave the storytelling a bit more into the puzzles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-2-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of the new In the Beginning expansion, for my money, these are the most difficult puzzles across the entirety of The Talos Principle: Reawakened. The fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of the 18 puzzles</a> in this new expansion were made in collaboration with some of The Talos Principles' biggest fans again did not surprise me. Getting through these puzzles felt like Nintendo had brought on popular kaizo designers for the next 2D Super Mario game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the difficulty of these puzzles made what should be The Talos Principle: Reawakened's shining star its biggest frustration. The bits of narrative you get from In the Beginning were just as, if not more interesting as what you can find in the base game and the Road to Gehenna DLC, but getting to them was such a struggle that I had a better time playing everything besides the In the Beginning expansion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-4-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Maybe that's because my freshness to The Talos Principle and its inner puzzle workings isn't on the same level as those who've been with this game for a decade. Still, the challenge these levels offer shouldn't stop anyone else like me, who enjoys a good puzzle game and has somehow not played The Talos Principle since its original release, from picking up The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

					<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>The Talos Principle and its expansion Road to Gehenna are undeniably two of the best puzzle game experiences available in video games. That unfortunately only makes the difficulty jump in the new In the Beginning expansion more frustrating, but it remains true for the base game, and both expansions that the struggle is worth it for the writing and storytelling. Especially if you're that diehard Talos Principle fan who can't wait to return to this simulated puzzle-garden paradise. The added developer commentary and amazing visuals from the Unreal Engine 5 upgrade wrap the whole collection up in a nice bow that make The Talos Principle: Reawakened a strong remaster, even more so if you're playing on PC at launch and get the bonus of the puzzle editor.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>The Unreal Engine 5 upgrade looks great
</li><li>The same excellent writing and storytelling that made the original game a gem still feel impactful a decade later
</li><li>A bevy of puzzles that are fun to solve that will make you feel like a genius once you get them</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>The new In the Beginning expansion is difficult beyond the point of frustration
</li><li>Puzzle editor not available to console players at launch
</li><li>Storytelling and puzzle gameplay don't feel as connected as they could be</li>						</ul>

What would put them on a collision course with Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark turned Victor von Doom? Well, after seeing an alleged leak from the set of the upcoming comic book blockbuster, some of them have a theory that’s just wild enough to be not altogether unconvincing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Alongside expected returns like Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Anthony Mackie as Captain America, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571?_gl=1*12v7cvo*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDI5MzEwMi43Ny4wLjE3NDQyOTMxMDIuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571?_gl=1*12v7cvo*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDI5MzEwMi43Ny4wLjE3NDQyOTMxMDIuNjAuMC4w">Marvel also revealed more surprising appearances</a></span> in the May 2026 <em>Avengers</em> sequel, including Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique, and James Marsden as Cyclops. It seemed like a bad Deadpool joke, but it was very, very real. It’s still anyone’s guess how all of those pieces will fit together, but after a fresh leak allegedly from the set of the upcoming blockbuster, there are some interesting ideas about what might actually be going on. </p><p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> <em>If you don’t want to read a description of footage that </em>might<em> be from the set of Avengers: Doomsday or read about what fans think it </em>could <em>mean for the movie, well, uh, you probably shouldn’t have clicked on this article but in either case you should definitely stop reading now.</em> </p><p>Someone uploaded apparent drone footage of what appears to be a set for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> to YouTube (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-avengers-doomsday-set-photo-has-mcu-fans-fearing-the-x-men-are-doomed-from-the-start&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-avengers-doomsday-set-photo-has-mcu-fans-fearing-the-x-men-are-doomed-from-the-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via <em>IGN</em></a></span>) and it depicts what almost definitely seems to be the courtyard of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, aka the X-Mansion, riddled with explosions and craters. The entire thing is surrounded by a perimeter of shipping containers stacked one on top of the other, just waiting to be CGI’d over with some hyper-expensive combat set piece. It looks very much like the type of battlefield you’d set up at your favorite <em>Warhammer</em> miniatures tabletop night. </p><p>So what does it mean? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1juka6h/new_look_at_the_doomsday_set_with_drone_footage/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1juka6h/new_look_at_the_doomsday_set_with_drone_footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well, some fans are going with the idea</a></span> that rather than being a mid-movie climax or final showdown, this fight is actually how <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> will begin, similar to the way <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> kicks off with Thanos fighting the Hulk. “It’d be badass if the intro of this movie was Dr. Doom beating the X-Men’s ass just like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-1784192280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-1784192280">the first ultimate alliance game</a></span>,” user BigPaleontologist520 wrote on the Marvel spoilers subreddit. </p><p>Others took it from there. “Oh yeah! That is an easy way to establish how badass Doom is—single handily finishing off an established superhero team,” responded InnocentTailor. “And getting the geriatric cast out of the movie earlier would make it less jarring to see them as they have aged,” followed up SpiffySpacemanSpiff. It’s certainly a neat, high-impact (and no doubt expensive) way to establish some big stakes in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, which for many already feels like a desperate cash grab after years of Marvel superhero burnout at the box office. Some might feel like it’s a waste to get the aughts <em>X-Men </em>cast back together again just to see them get wrecked at the start, but it would certainly stop the gimmick from descending into purely nostalgic fan service. </p><p>Of course, this might not be the case at all. Just because the X-Men are fighting at the mansion doesn’t mean it’s occurring near the beginning of the movie, or against Dr. Doom and an army of Doombot-like sentinels. With multiverse incursions seemingly at play, the writers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> have the plot tools to basically do whatever they want and make it sorta make sense. Plus the X-Mansion is always under attack. As one Reddit user noted, “I wouldn’t read too much into it, the school blows up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
        
<p>There’s a new game coming from the developer of The Axis Unseen, and it’s not what you’d likely expect. Just Purkey Games, the studio operated by developer Nate Purkeypile, has announced Deedlee Doo! Carkour!, a new “racing” game where you do parkour with a car using explosions.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch on May 12, 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582590/Deedlee_Doo_Carkour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>“Everything in the game is made out of clay in real life,” the game’s description reads. “The sound effects and music are all mouth sounds. If you screw up a jump, children laugh and make fun of you. (Just like real life!) Can you reach the top of the Meowtain?”</p>



<p>Regarding the clay art style, it was all sculpted in real life as the description reads. Some of the sculptures, however, were done by Purkeypile’s own children before they were scanned into the game. </p>



<p>In addition to the game’s announcement, a reveal trailer was also released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You'll have to pay up.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid continued frustration and confusion from fans about how much the Nintendo Switch 2 and its games are going to cost them (especially in the United States, where that seems to be perpetually in flux), we've just learned about yet another charge that may not have been obvious to everyone at first. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 edition doesn't come with the Expansion Pass, meaning you'll have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the new system if you don't already own it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That might sound like a no-brainer, but let me explain. Since the announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2's games and their pricing last week, there's been no end to the confusion about how it's all going to work. What we currently know is that if you already own The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch, you can play that same game on your Nintendo Switch 2, including with the DLC if you've already purchased it, no problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there's also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Nintendo Switch 2 Enhanced Edition of Breath of the Wild</a>. It comes with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-graphical-comparison-treehouse-live">improved visuals and performance</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2">achievements</a>, as well as support for the new "Zelda Notes" service in the Nintendo Switch Online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild on the Switch, you won't get those features automatically, but you can purchase an "upgrade pack" for $10 to get access to all that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that leaves folks who don't own the game yet at all, but might want to purchase it on the Nintendo Switch 2. They can purchase a Nintendo Switch 2 Enhanced Edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at (so basically the price of the original game and the pack). But it won't include the DLC Expansion Pack, so if you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. $90 total for the full Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a statement from Nintendo, who told IGN: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC. That DLC is available as a separate purchase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might argue that that's only fair given that it's effectively what existing owners of the game have already paid anyway, plus the cost of the upgrade. It's not like there's a mysterious upcharge happening here. But it's worth pointing out that most other gaming publishers eventually get around to dropping the price on eight-year-old games, or offer "enhanced editions" for later systems that include the DLC bundled in to help ease the financial burden on players interested in jumping in. A whopping $90 for the most current version of a game that came out in 2017 <em>on the Wii U</em> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">feels painful</a>, especially in light of Mario Kart World retailing at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">unheard-of $80</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">Nintendo Switch 2 costing $450</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">perhaps even more</a>, depending on what Nintendo decides to do about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-sony-and-more-japanese-game-companies-suffer-stock-market-plunge-as-trumps-tariffs-hit-hard">current tariff situation</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it won't matter, and maybe everyone who is ever going to realistically play Breath of the Wild largely already owns at least a base version of the game given how well it's already sold. But if you were waiting to pull the trigger on it (and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom) for a new, shinier system, you'll have to keep the cost of Breath of the Wild's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/12/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-champions-ballad-dlc-review">very good Expansion Pass</a> in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft has released a new Xbox commercial directed by Oscar-nominated director David Fincher and Romain Chassaing that carries a message: "Wake up the human inside." </p><p>In the video, we see a person named Horatio who lives his daily life like a rat, going from task to task with little energy or excitement.

            <p>Xbox has roped in a famous film director for its latest brand trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer in question is titled "Wake Up" and is directed by none other than David Fincher, as in Seven and Fight Club's film director.</p>

<p>Xbox's trailer begins with a poor ol' rat by the name of Horatio waking up to start another day at his desk job with all the other overworked rats out there. Of course, he does manage to get some exercise in beforehand by running on a giant wheel, but even this healthy start isn't enough to distract from the mundanity of his job.</p>
<p>However, once Horatio finally makes it through "a day in the rat race" (oooh, I get it!), he boots up his Xbox to connect with his friends, and this "much-needed dose of fun transforms him into the human he always was", Xbox states. Ahhh.</p>
<p>Xbox isn't the only company to use gaming as an escape from the real, mundane world as a marketing beat. Who can forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-targets-unexpected-demographic-in-quietly-devastating-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ad"> Nintendo's quietly devastating trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fragpunk-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Guitar Studio has announced the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and the console versions of the game are not too far away at all.</p>

<p>As revealed in an official announcement on the&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/news/official/20250410/40587_1226546.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the free-to-play 5v5 hero shooter will be coming to current-gen machines on April 29th. Unfortunately, it's not hitting last-gen consoles, nor has a Switch 2 version of the game been announced at time of writing.</p>

<p><em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>launched on Steam on March 6th as planned, but just a day or so before the game's planned console launch, it was <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a>, with Bad Guitar citing "unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=vTRuhqml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=tOewjM6p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Guitar's colorful shooter&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is launching on consoles later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make up for that delay, Bad Guitar says it will issue "plenty of gifts" to those playing&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>on consoles, including "exclusive time-limited event rewards" from the start of the game's first season through April 29th.</p>

<p>That's slightly confusingly worded, but it sounds as though all console players will be receiving those gifts without having to do anything, which is nice. Additionally, if you bought the Pioneer Bundle on consoles, you'll get "additional gifts".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>will also support crossplay between PC and consoles, and cross-progression will also be supported, so you can take your&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>stuff from PC and enjoy it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S if you like.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar is also promising a "smooth gameplay experience" on consoles, including aim assist for those on controllers, which is designed to "minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input".</p>




<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 5v5 hero shooter with a unique selling point in the form of its Shard Cards, which can be deployed to add effects like buff shots for your teammates, healing, and plenty of other extras.</p>

<p>The game is going up against the likes of Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and it remains to be seen whether it's got the staying power of those games or whether it'll go the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report" rel="nofollow">2K's&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>seems to be going</a>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fragpunk/9mw715j1p29d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 29th.</p>

<p>FragPunk has announced that it is launching for Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on April 29, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-console-launch-gifts-crossplay-support-and-more">FragPunk Console Launch Gifts, Crossplay Support and More</h2>



<p>To celebrate FragPunk’s launch on consoles, the developers have arranged some gifts for players. Players who use newly registered console game accounts can claim the gifts. The gifts will also include exclusive time-limited event rewards that will be available from the start of Season 1 to April 29. The owners of the Pioneer bundle will be eligible for these gifts. More details about rewards and distribution will be revealed close to the launch.</p>



<p>FragPunk players wondering if they can compete with PC players or want to have their accounts on both platforms will be happy to know that the console version will feature crossplay and cross-progression. More details about cross-platform features will be shared ahead of the launch.</p>



<p>FragPunk’s console launch will also bring some buffs to controllers to provide a smooth gameplay experience. Players on the console version will observe that the controller players will have enhanced aim assist. This feature has been added to “minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input and provide an equally competitive environment for all players.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatros-latest-accolade-is-a-surprise-appearance-in-netflixs-black-mirror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a wildly successful awards seasons, the breakout indie game sensation Balatro continues to reach a mainstream audience, with a surprise appearance in the hit Netflix series Black Mirror. The show’s creator is a big fan, and the game’s appearance is the latest accolade for a game with momentum that will not slow down.</p>



<h2 id="h-balatro-s-breakout-success-carries-into-2025-with-black-mirror-appearance">Balatro’s Breakout Success Carries Into 2025 with Black Mirror Appearance</h2>



<p>A number of fans of the show Black Mirror quickly spotted the appearance of Balatro in “Hotel Reverie,” the third episode of the latest series, which stars actresses Issa Rae, Awkwafina, Emma Corrin, and Harriet Walter. The sci-fi-dystopia series released its seventh series today, and its fifth since switching from the UK’s Channel 4 to global streaming giant Netflix. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charlie Brooker, the creator, producer, and head writer for Black Mirror, was at one point obsessed with Balatro, according <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-interview-1236034654/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an interview</a> he did with entertainment outlet Deadline back in August 2024.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This is going to sound so tragic, but right now there’s a game called Balatro. It’s like poker, and it’s possibly the most addictive thing ever created. It’s currently on Nintendo Switch and Steam deck, but it’s going to be released on phones, and at that point I think humankind’s activity is going to drop about 25%. I play that in short bursts when I’m writing to reward myself.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the game wished at the time that maybe Balatro could be the primary focus of an episode of Black Mirror, but most are happy with an appearance in the show. I say “most” since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1jvun13/balatro_is_in_the_new_black_mirror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a number of fans are upset</a> with how the character is playing. One of the Jokers in play is Sixth Sense, which rewards you with a Spectral card if your first hand is just a single 6, but they play a Full House instead. Some with even keener eyes have noticed that the all the Jokers in play line up with the tutorial seed.</p>



<p>After releasing in the beginning of 2024, Balatro ended the year with widespread critical and commercial success. The game has landed several awards over the past few months, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s Indie Game of the Year award</a>, and added a BAFTA for Debut Game just days before the latest Black Mirror series dropped.</p>



<p>What else is next in Balatro’s meteoric rise? A movie appearance? A sequel? Let us know what you think in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

That's what some people are wondering in the wake of the tariff situation that's dominated headlines in recent days.</p><p>If Nintendo even wanted to do this, it would take "years" to get such an operation up and running, New York University Stern School of Business economics professor Joseph Foudy said in an interview.</p><p>"Nintendo would have to set up a final assembly factory in the US, which means finding land, building a facility, and recruiting a workforce," Foudy told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/555749/switch-2-america-usa-production-how-fast-tariffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>Even if Nintendo established manufacturing plants in the USA, that wouldn't be the end of the matter, as the Switch 2's custom parts are produced internationally and would face tariffs when entering the country. Nintendo would also need to employe people for a factory, of course, and this could prove costly as well given labor rates in the US vs. abroad.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1222225698"

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-happened-to-me-i-wrote-those-shitty-tweet-roundups.1160610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tweet-roundup-buzzfeed-kotaku-internet-culture<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have written so many articles in my life as a journalist, often multiple ones in a day. I can’t honestly say I’m proud of everything I’ve written—I don’t <em>remember</em> everything I’ve written—but I have very few regrets. One thing I do feel ambivalent about are all the tweet roundups I wrote.</p><p>At any Gawker site, traffic was the end all, be all of your career. I didn’t work at Kotaku during the time when bonuses, or even your employment, was determined by traffic, thank god. But even after that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/15/traffic-ben-smith-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">era</a>, traffic was on the forefront of everyone’s mind. An article that did under 20,000 views was often considered a failure. It is strange to look back and realize that there was an expectation for me to, every day, attract enough people to the website to fill Madison Square Garden.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to do this was by writing tweet roundups, a format pioneered by <a href="https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buzzfeed</a> where a writer goes on Twitter, finds some tweets, and then puts them into an article. I first did this when I worked as the assistant editor of Paste Magazine’s comedy section, where every week I found tweets from comedians and took screenshots of them and put them in a slideshow. In the Gawker office, there was a big TV screen dedicated to showing the current traffic numbers for articles on the various websites. Whenever I would write an “internet reacts to…” blog full of tweets, I would reliably end up on the big board.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I looked at this as a way of paying for my serious work—a hundred thousand views on a tweet roundup would offset the relatively lower traffic I got on pieces of criticism. The guilt I feel about these articles isn’t so much about exposing people to attention they weren’t ready for. <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/twitter-is-public-1543016594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tweets are public</a>, and I also tried to only post tweets that were popular, or came from accounts with a following. (We had a variety of conversations over the years about how many followers made an account fair game to use.) My guilt springs from a different source: writing these blogs revealed to me just how malleable reality is once it reaches the internet.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Seeing something intended for a specific audience <em>leave</em> that audience does suck shit every fucking time.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I have written so many “internet reacts” blogs that the entire experience blends together. I do have memories of the ways people would react to finding themselves in these blogs, both negative and positive. My favorite reaction was always people changing their display names to something vulgar, so that now all the visitors to Kotaku would have to read a brief sentence about gay sex or whatever; it seemed like the kind of impish prank I would pull.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes people would get really, really mad. Due to the frequent, careful conversations I had with editors about how to minimize potential harassment, most of the time I thought this was bullshit; once a tweet goes incredibly viral, it’s basically out of your hands. However, as someone who has experienced a lot of internet harassment over viral tweets, regardless of how this happens, seeing something intended for a specific audience <em>leave</em> that audience does suck shit every fucking time.</p><p>I struggled with all of the entire time I wrote these kinds of pieces, even though I called dibs on Kotaku’s “internet reacts” posts every time there was even a possibility I could do them. When I look back on the 2010s, I find it bizarre that this was an accepted form of blogging for so long, even though it was everywhere. With every new album, video game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">television</a>, or cultural event, sites across the internet would elevate the voices of random Twitter people. Sometimes it made me feel generous, like I was helping other people understand the value of talking with strangers on the internet, something that had given a lot to me. The internet has given me real and deep friendships, job opportunities—I met my husband in a Twitter group chat. But the internet has also made me sadder than anything else in the entire world. I didn’t want to ever be the source of a stranger’s sadness in that way.</p><p>But my feelings weren’t just about the harm I could potentially cause other people, even when adhering to the ethics that journalists rely on to minimize harm in all our different forms of reporting. These kinds of articles started to make me think that the internet is kind of just fake. Once I put a frame around something, I was giving it a sense of importance. I got to determine what the conversation was, what the tone was, who the players were. It was a lot of power that I felt uncomfortable wielding.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The internet and the way people use the internet fucks with everyone’s sense of scale.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the pieces, none of that struggle is evident at all. But sometimes these social media roundups look like I’m describing a widespread phenomenon, when the nature of the internet makes it hard to ever really know how big or how widespread a certain conversation is. This demonstrates the inherent power involved in writing and reporting: Your readers trust you, and if you define the contours of a conversation, people will believe you. There are moments when something does truly sweep across the internet to become a global talking point, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like The Dress</a>, but often a tweet roundup is actually just a roundup of things that particular writer is seeing in their own small silo of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a challenge for all reporting—before something is news, it’s just something that some people are talking about. A journalist is a person who talks to those people and writes everything down, and one of the biggest parts of the profession is doing so in a way that creates trust with your audience. But the internet and the way people use the internet fucks with everyone’s sense of scale, including journalists’.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was studying cinema in college, we talked a lot about framing. People love to imagine that documentary is “truth,” but anyone who has dabbled in the form knows that there is always a tension between crafting a narrative and depicting what your camera has captured. The camera isn’t a tool designed to capture the world as we actually see it with our eyes, but to capture the world in the way that the person holding the camera wants to. Non-fiction writing of all kinds is the same kind of illusion; this is why journalists often push back on the idea of “objectivity.” I can only write from my perspective, with my biases, only find conversations that are accessible to me from my view of the internet. I wasn’t writing blogs about what “the internet” was reacting to—I was writing to describe what I see as “the internet.”&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Increasingly, I don’t think there is such a thing as “internet culture,” or I don’t think it’s much different from regular culture.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s easy to see how this can become a problem: If you go on YouTube right now, there are dozens of incendiary videos from right wing grifter types who are trying to create a “phenomenon” out of maybe one or two tweets. It makes me feel gross to know that I participated in this kind of activity, the creation of a “moment” by putting a frame around a conversation. And to my disgust, people like Asmongold use the same reasoning I did when I was regularly writing “internet reacts” blogs: he has <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1766176866786746381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that these posts are public and that if the people who wrote them get criticized, it’s not his fault. But I know that there is a difference between writing a cheeky tweet meant for one’s small Twitter audience and having that same post taken out of context and presented to a school of bloodthirsty piranhas.</p><p>My editor, Riley (of course), thinks that maybe these two things aren’t quite the same thing, but I don’t know if we’d see such a volume of bad faith influencer types taking tweets out of context if The Dress or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/yanny-or-laurel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurel or Yanny</a> didn’t take off in the ways that they did. These were articles that took a conversation that was localized to Twitter and broadcast them to the world stage. Suddenly, these ephemeral moments of Twitter obsession <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wOUH9ImArw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became news segments</a> for normal people. In retrospect, it’s easy to see how taking a bit of fun gossip, grabbing some posts, and then publishing it on a website that often gets traffic equivalent to the population of Albany, NY in a day would perpetuate a conversation, giving it more importance than it truly deserves. You can manufacture an entire news cycle this way, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/how-one-tweet-wreaked-havoc-on-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manipulate the stock market</a>, or create a conspiracy theory <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about a small video game consulting firm</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the way the form can be used maliciously, it makes me feel like maybe all of it—both the Buzzfeed tweet round ups and the reactionary grifter economy—is bullshit. Increasingly, I don’t think there is such a thing as “internet culture,” or I don’t think it’s much different from regular culture. People love gossip, and all of this is just a new way to find and experience gossip. But while gossip can be harmless fun, like trying to understand how a dress can look like different colors to different people, gossip can also be extremely painful, and our pursuit of it can come at the cost of both the subjects of our gossiping and ourselves.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price"><h3>With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem</h3></a><p>Like Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Valve, Epic, and everyone else before it</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s first major event for 2025 in the form of Cursed Hollow, which will give you the chance to unlock all kinds of unique rewards when it debuts next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 17th, Cursed Hollow will operate in a similar manner to other seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a> or Winter's Jest, and the event will also sport a number of improvements based on feedback received for previous updates.</p>

<p>The new event will task you with "identifying ghosts, completing objectives, and discovering the totems scattered across [<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s] maps". Activating totems will affect "that which haunts you - the Forest Spirit", and those effects might be boons or drawbacks for you and your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=6byqXshq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=kox7Cc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cursed Hollow brings creepy totems and a Forest Spirit to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Rewards for the event will be split into two categories: Community and Personal. Community goals will essentially work the same way as previous&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>event goals have, while Personal goals will be "unique to the player".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cursed Hollow will be a little different to previous updates thanks to changes based on community feedback. These include a map rotation system, a shorter duration for the event, and gameplay modifiers similar to those introduced in Crimson Eye.</p>

<p>Of course, it won't just be the seasonal event that debuts in the Cursed Hollow update; Kinetic Games says there will also be a number of permanent gameplay improvements and quality-of-life tweaks, all of which will be revealed in the patch notes next week.</p>

<p>Released in Early Access all the way back in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>also got its long-awaited console release in December last year, with the game going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies on consoles</a> in just over a month.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix's Devil May Cry Has Already Been Renewed for a Second Season]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-devil-may-cry-has-already-been-renewed-for-a-second-season.1160580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Adi Shankar, has been renewed for a second season just a week after its initial air date.</p>

<p>In a fairly simple <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1910331989678338091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix confirms that season 2 of&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is coming "soon", although the streaming giant stops short of announcing a date for the second season's airing. The announcement is accompanied by some appropriately edgy-looking artwork of protagonist Dante.</p>

<p>Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2018</a>, with the showrunner affectionately referring to the show as part of his "bootleg multiverse" alongside his animated&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=JJhw132b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=9FHh7YFA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adi Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will be returning for a second season.</figcaption></figure><p>We got our first look at the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, when a debut trailer was released alongside an initial look at Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>animated series.</p>

<p>Following that, it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series would debut in April this year, and indeed, the series' first eight-episode run premiered on April 3rd to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/devil-may-cry-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mostly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The show revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Dante, who comes into conflict with a terrorist known only as the White Rabbit while also battling the government organization DARKCOM.</p>

<p>Given that the show's timeline doesn't quite seem to match up with the games' story, it's reasonable to assume that the show isn't part of the games' canon, although Shankar could well prove me wrong on that front with the second season.</p>




<p><em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is just one of the shows based on video games to debut in recent years. Others include the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and its sequel series&nbsp;<em>Nocturne</em>, as well as shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, shows based on properties like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">Pacific Drive</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>(yes, another one) are also reportedly in the works, although the UK's Daily Mail cast some <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doubt</a> on the latter earlier today.</p>

<p>You can check out all eight episodes of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>on the streaming platform right now. The show's second season doesn't have a release date or window yet.</p>
