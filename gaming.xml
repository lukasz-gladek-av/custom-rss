            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>From the opening strains of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s beautiful title track, it’s clear that this is an RPG that’s embracing its own sense of style. With French-language vocals and sweeping orchestration, it sets a tone for a game that feels unequivocally French. When you see the twisted remains of Paris, you’ll understand why.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsElVZ0sLtU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur begins in Lumiere, a city set within a fantastical interpretation of France. In this world, the oldest members of society die out, erased by the Paintress, who paints a number on her cursed monolith once a year, erasing everyone of that age. Each year, that number gets lower, slowly but surely edging towards zero. Clair Obscur opens with you bidding farewell to those aged 34, your love amongst them. Gustave, our central character, voiced by Daredevil star Charlie Cox, sets out as part of Expedition 33, a group dedicating the final year of their life to trying to combat this inevitable destruction of the human race, fighting back against the Paintress and her inexplicable taste for number-based death.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur is simply stunning. You should check out one of the game’s early trailers to get a true sense of it, but the team at Sandfall Interactive have captured the fantastical and the unlikely in a way that feels genuinely unique. Sunlight reflects off the dust particles floating through the air, the landscape shifts and shimmers while mist caresses your character. Looking upwards, though, it becomes clear that this is a broken land, with floating rocks and giant growths filling the purple-hued skyline. Beneath it, you soon find the ugly side of this world, coming across the remains of your Expedition, routed beneath the enemy’s banners.</p>


<p>Gustave takes this poorly, sitting amongst the fallen bodies of his bodies and manifesting a pistol that he holds to his own temple. It’s only the interjection of teammate Lune that stops him from joining them. There’s a close-run vein of darkness and depression that Clair Obscur looks to plough, and Cox’s delivery only heightens the sense of pain and loss that lies at the game’s heart. You can expect the drama and emotion to be maximised by the stellar voice cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and Final Fantasy XVI’s Ben Starr, and I found myself hanging on every word of dialogue during the preview.</p>
<p>The Expedition’s health and safety is at the centre of your experience. You can heal the entire group using Chroma Elixirs, as well as keep a watchful eye over the Expedition’s status and key objectives at any time, and this plays into the idea that this quest isn’t just about one person, it’s for every remaining member of the human race.</p>

<p>Combat is played out via turn-based battles, and the same attention to visual design found in the environment has made its way into these encounters. The UI experience has to be the most stylish we’ve seen since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio’s</a>, with your battle wheel letting you access Attacks, Skills, and Items, all of which you’ll need to utilise to prevail against Clair Obscur’s fantastical enemies.</p>
<p>There’s an active element to these turns, though, where pressing the dodge button at the right time might see you escape from damage. If you time it at the last moment, you’ll gain a Perfect Dodge and earn additional charges on your Overcharge Meter.</p>
<p>That Overcharge Meter lets you perform your most powerful attacks, and here too Clair Obscur wants you to be involved, giving Skills extra damage if you successfully time the right button press with your attack. You might wonder about the return of QTEs, or hark back to your favourite Mario RPGs, but they serve to keep you on your toes, unable to look away for a moment.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Parrying, which rather than getting you out of the way, sees you hitting a smaller window of opportunity to repel enemy attacks. If you’re able to successfully Parry multiple attacks in a row, you can answer back with a devastating counter. Parrying feels excellent here, maybe even a little overpowered, but successfully pulling one off gives you a shot of endorphins that most turn-based RPGs can only dream of.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Clair Obscur doesn’t want players to be passive observers during its turn-based battling, and it feels closer to an action title than many other RPGs. You have to be well prepared and engaged if you want to get the most out of it, getting your party through encounters in the quickest time possible, while incurring the least damage.</p>
<p>Giving you something else to think about, some characters can inflict Stains on enemies. These elemental marks can cause additional damage if you’re thoughtful about the order in which you attack, and single attacks might produce multiple effects. Lune’s Ice Lance skill inflicts both an Ice Stain and a Light Stain, and you can then consume them with opposing skills, such as a Fire Skill like Immolation. These also play into Elemental Affinities, and while some might cause additional damage, you might heal enemies if you choose the wrong one.</p>
<p>Tonally, there are aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that remind me of Eternal Sonata, the JRPG set within the dying mind of Frederic Chopin. There’s the same quiet sense of the inevitable that creeps into every moment here, while the exquisite orchestration brings both melancholy and grandeur to the incredible events. There’s a darkness here that’s utterly unmatched, and while some might find the atmosphere oppressive, there’s a kernel of hope to wrap yourself around.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to juggle in Clair Obscur’s combat systems, and I came away from our preview thoroughly invested in the world and its turn-based action. For fans of role-playing games, this is one Expedition you don’t want to miss.</p>

			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 4 missions from Act 1</li>
<li>All 6 playable characters</li>
<li>Experience core aspects of the game (MIssions, Relationship Building, Town Building</li>
<li>Upgrades, Crafting)</li>
<li>Unlimited playthroughs</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours of gameplay per campaign</li>
<li>Local and remote co-op play</li>
</ul>
<p>GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, both of which were recently reviewed on Wccftech. The other highlight is undoubtedly inZOI, which features the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and ray tracing, both available to GFN Ultimate tier subscribers. The game also marks the debut of the NVIDIA ACE technology through the so-called Smart ZOI NPCs, powered by a 0.5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs exclusively on GeForce RTX hardware. inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches tomorrow in early access</a>. Lastly, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a> is also available via GeForce NOW.</p>

MicroProse or whatever currently prospers under the decades-old MicroProse banner have announced that they're publishing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strategos">Strategos</a>, a real-time tactics wargame set in classical antiquity. I hadn't heard of the game before, and my first reaction to the above screenshot was "oh hey, Total War: Rome". Then I veni, vidi, vickied on over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3064810/Strategos/">Steam page</a>, and it turns out that might be a flawed comparison, not least because Strategos is the creation of a single designer and programmer with artists working on contract. Here's a trailer.

Strategos appears much more focussed on battle reenactments than Total War, with seemingly no overworld manoeuvring to worry about, though it does feature some kind of campaign element. It's also an absolute mess of factions and subfactions. There are 120 (!) armies to choose from, encompassing 250 individual units. I don't recognise most of them - Meroitic Kushites, anyone? Spanish Celtiberians? It's like watching somebody fashion shieldwalls from Haribo's back catalogue. There are five different flavours of Macedonian army alone, divvied up according to the lifespan and legacy of Alexander The Great. 
</p>
<p>
The Steam progress notes are heavy on insights about the different playstyles cultivated by these factions, and the corresponding granularity of the AI. Here's a representative excerpt from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3064810/view/621036698051019444?l=english">a post earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>"The AI has undergone various improvements to behavior and deployment. They are able to pick auto drop flanks better, move and maintain their line better, deploy and use horse archer armies more intelligently, and I've added more and better bespoke AI for Lancer lines, overwhelmingly light foot armies, medium foot armies, and bowmen deployments (including some bespoke deployments for bowmen armies that mix staggered lines of bowmen and infantry to protect their shooters, and for certain medium foot armies that will post up in terrain and draw you in with light troops/shooters). There are fixes to pursuit to charge, pursuing and evading with intervening routed units, moving and attacking coherently in formation, using more reserves, having multiple units coordinate against single targets, more intelligent evades based on matchup, pursuers pursuing other pursuers, and fixes to pathing around combats."</blockquote>

<p>
Speaking as somebody who is weary of kiting AI generals in Twarhammer, I like the sound of these intricacies, though the proof will naturally be in the pudding. I also like the sound of the game's army control system, which requires you to place generals within bellowing distance of units you wish to command, or else send a courier on horseback with their marching orders.</p>
<p>You can't, in other words, just micromanage a frontline two miles wide from the sky, like in Total War. I'm definitely more PC strategy gamer than wargamer, but this gives me pleasant memories of the old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-combat">Close Combat</a> series, in which you had to worry about losing radio contact with troopers during straggly, unpredictable engagements.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, here's a rundown of bulletpoints for Strategos:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Simulate Large-Scale Battles - Command thousands of soldiers on-screen in meticulously crafted historical and speculative engagements.
</p>
<p>
- Master A New Scale Of Tactics - Experience the depth of tabletop wargaming in thrilling moment-to-moment gameplay. Strategic unit formations, morale shocks, fog of war, terrain effects, flanking maneuvers, and an advanced command and control system inspired by classic wargaming.
</p>
<p>
- Lead Armies from Across the Ancient World - Choose from over 120 factions and 250+ unique unit types, spanning nearly a thousand years of history--from Greek hoplites and Persian Immortals to the legions of Rome and the rise of the Sasanian Empire.
</p>
<p>
- Customize Your Experience - Conquer alongside the great generals of history in the Campaign mode, reenact specific historical battles, or set up custom battles within the Historical Battle Simulator. Select your army list and allies, units, maps, difficulty levels and AI behavior, or relive historical clashes such as the Battles of Issos and Raphia, with more to come!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A quick chaser: Strategos is also the name of a military training simulator created by Charles A. L. Totten for the United States Army. Published in 1880, it was revived in the 20th century and has influenced a bunch of table-top games. I imagine you can trace its impact forward into video games as well.

But the mobile app has never locked one inside one of its pricey bundles before. To get the shiny Mewtwo full art,  you’re going to need to pay that extra 25 bucks.</p><figure id="" data-id="27eb5cd47ad46223df4899589eeb9da0" data-recommend-id="image://27eb5cd47ad46223df4899589eeb9da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The two current bundles from the app, with their prices in some mysterious foreign currency." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The two current bundles from the app, with their prices in some mysterious foreign currency." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27eb5cd47ad46223df4899589eeb9da0" data-recommend-id="image://27eb5cd47ad46223df4899589eeb9da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The two current bundles from the app, with their prices in some mysterious foreign currency." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shiny-revelry-pokemon-tcg-pocket-ranked-rare-charizard-1851771590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shiny-revelry-pokemon-tcg-pocket-ranked-rare-charizard-1851771590">Shining Revelry marks the appearance of shiny Pokémon to <em>Pocket</em></a></span><em>. </em>It’s a term that bemuses billions of parents, who understandably think it refers to holographic cards, but instead means pocket monsters colored differently to their usual appearance. In the real-world card game, these are enormously popular, thanks to their rarity and novelty. Collectors love ‘em, so it’s not the loveliest move to make one of the most desirable cards locked behind such a hefty paywall.</p><p>What’s even more frustrating is that these bundles don’t even offer value for money. (Well, relative “value,” given the entire store is based on the conceit of us paying real money for imaginary “gold,” in turn to buy sealed packs with incredibly poor pull-rates. We’re paying to gamble, but the prizes don’t tangibly exist.) Inside you get 120 Poké Gold, then a bunch of meh cosmetics (coin, playmat, sleeves, a frame), and the Mewtwo card. To buy 120 Gold at the regular price would cost $20, so you’re not even getting a discount!</p><p>And to reiterate, that “Gold” doesn’t guarantee you <em>anything</em> new. I recently made a sucker of myself and bought some so I could open a bunch of packs at once—I spent $20 and got not one single card I didn’t already have, and only duplicated <em>two</em> special art cards across 20 packs. (I had seven packs in a row contain nothing but two-diamond or lower cards!) That’s the nature of gacha.</p><figure id="" data-id="104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-recommend-id="image://104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-recommend-id="image://104d50cca1bea9b228dcdd0f302de27e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The contents of the new bundle, screenshotted from the app." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you load <em>Pocket</em> today, it’ll ask for an update, which adds Shining Revelry to the app. As has been the case for the last few new sets, there’s no celebratory offer of bonus hourglasses, or fun new challenges to unlock the same. You either spend a small fortune, or you open you’re usual one or two packs. Weeeee.</p><p>There’s another small change: the game has tweaked how Wonder Picks work. The good news: it’s now far faster, without that pointless pause before shuffling. The bad news: for some godforsaken reason it now reveals the other four cards you didn’t “pick” first, so you learn you didn’t get the card you wanted <em>before</em> it reveals the bulk crap you actually got. Wow, great stuff guys. Really thinking this through.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that of the two packs I’ve opened, and the <em>eighteen</em> I can see in my Wonder Picks, not a single one of them features a shiny Pokémon. But at least you can pay $25 to guarantee getting <em>one</em> of them!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now, no additional platforms have been confirmed or announced for <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> beyond Steam, with iOS and Android being announced (and launching) [today]. The PlayStation Store listing was simply a placeholder.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its store pages:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Relive the game that started it all! The original Backyard Baseball ’97, now enhanced to run on Steam. Whether you’re picking your dream team, hitting home runs, or just here for the witty banter, step back into the backyard and experience the game that made baseball fun for everyone!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Play pick-up games, practice batting, keep track of stats, compete in single games or a whole season – you can even set the rules! Backyard Baseball ‘97 features all of the realism and statistics of adult baseball games but with simple, intuitive controls that anyone can master.</p><p><strong>Batter Up, Playground Style</strong></p><p>The rules for Backyard Baseball are a hybrid of Major and Little League rules:</p><ul><li>No leading off</li><li>No Injuries</li><li>Bunting is allowed</li><li>Tagging up is allowed</li><li>You can also practice batting</li></ul><p>To get into the swing of things, choose a batter and face Mr. Clanky for some batting practice. This is where you’ll learn just when to click to make your chosen batter hit that ball!</p><p><strong>One Nation Under Pablo</strong></p><p>For many fans, this is the game that debuted one of the most iconic video game characters of the 90s or any era—the legend himself, Pablo Sanchez. Build a roster from a cast of 30 hilarious child athletes who made Backyard Baseball a cult classic.</p><p><strong>Game Modes</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Random Pick-Up</strong> – A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li><li><strong>Single Game</strong> – You take turns with the computer, choosing players from a random pool of characters.</li><li><strong>Season</strong> – You create a team and manage the team through a 14 game series. The opposing teams are computer generated. At the end of the season the best two teams advance to the BBL playoffs (best of three). The playoffs winner advances to the championship series which consists of the Super Entire Nation Tournament (best of three) and then the Ultra Grand Championship of the Universe Series (best of five)!</li></ul><p><strong>Global Leaderboard</strong></p><p>Compete globally! Steam’s Leaderboard system lets you compete with friends and players around the world. Track your home runs, strike-outs, grand slams, season wins and more in real-time. See how you stack up and strive to reach the top!</p><p>At our core, we are fans first–not just of video games but of the Backyard Sports franchise. Fans have asked for accessible and legal ways to play their original Backyard titles for years, and we are excited to deliver.</p><p>Without having access to the source code, there are hard limitations on the experience we can create. As an example, we can’t support gamepads, nor the Steam deck, in these original titles. We can’t use the original 32bit code to support modern macOS, as even with an incredibly clever wrapper, macOS can’t execute the binaries.</p><p>We can make the game run buttery smooth, stack it with Steam achievements to test your mettle and give you a chance to batter up to compete in the Steam Global Leaderboards for Home Runs. Baseball 1997 runs well, looks better than ever, and creates a new installation for digital preservation within the Backyard Sports catalog that allows the next generation of fans to fall in love with the title that started it all.</p><p><strong>Development</strong></p><p>With the original source code lost in the years since the 1997 release, Playground Productions has teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the original titles and bring them to modern devices. Forming a team of avid gamers and <em>Backyard Sports</em> enthusiasts, Mega Cat accomplished a near-impossible feat by hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds to be compatible with current generation PCs. It was a meticulous process that took a considerable amount of time and effort to revitalize the game. Given the intricacies involved in this remaster, <em>Backyard Baseball ’97</em> is only compatible with PC devices at this time, but both Mega Cat and Playground Productions are working diligently to ensure <em>Backyard Sports</em> becomes available on multiple platforms moving forward.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>So, it turns out that I've been pronouncing Balatro wrong all this time, and now feel like a total spade. I really don't know how to <em>deal</em> with this revelation, it's left me rather <em>flush</em>-ed. </p>
<p>I have been saying B-<strong>LAH</strong>-tro, but that's not exactly how the deckbuilder's anonymous developer pronounces it. According to Naman Budhwar - that is to say, the head of video marketing at Balatro publisher Playstack - LocalThunk puts the emphasis on the 'Bah' in Balatro.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro">GameFile's Stephen Totilo</a>, Budhwar said LocalThunk pronounces the name of his roguelike deckbuilder thus: "<strong>BAH</strong>-luh-trow."</p>
<p>So, my almost throw away effort on the B is not what its maker calls the game. Whoops!</p>
<p>Not that it sounds like LocalThunk will really mind my poor pronunciation, though. Budhwar said it was kind of like "a 'gif/jif' situation", and people can just say Balatro the way that feels right for them  (for the record, I say gif with a hard G).</p>
<p>"He doesn’t really mind how people say it," Budhwar said of LocalThunk, to which Totilo jokingly asked if pronouncing it "<strong>BAY</strong>-la-tro" would still fly.</p>
<p>"Sure, you can say BAY-la-tro, yeah," Budhwar replied, but I am not sure that will ever stick. To paraphrase Regina George, stop trying to make BAY-la-tro happen.</p>
<p>I am curious, what do you call it?</p>

            <p>A voice actor from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> has been recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike, causing others to come out in support.</p>
<p>John Patneaude was the voice of Kinich in the free-to-play adventure from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a>, but in a statement shared on social media they revealed they have been recast due to the strike over AI protections.</p>
<p>"I've been withholding voice-over services during the SAG-AFTRA Interactive Strike because Hoyo/Cognosphere wouldn't offer AI protections in the form of a SAG Interim Agreement," they said. "They'd kept my character's dialogue silent for months, all the while I had made the difficult decision to continue not going in until an interim agreement was signed and this ultimately was why I was recast."</p>

<p>They continued: "Now obviously, a recast is not what I wanted. I'd hoped that any progress behind the scenes would be made and I could come back safely, or that if recast auditions went out my colleagues wouldn't read for them. Unfortunately, I was wrong."</p>
<p>Patneaude described Genshin Impact as a "comfort game during the early parts of the pandemic" and called the role a "dream".</p>
<p>"I would and can return if Hoyo invites me back and signs an interim," they concluded. "I stand by my choices regardless of the outcome. Also, the strike is still ongoing - please don't believe disinformation on the internet."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following Patneaude's recasting, other voice actors from Genshin Impact have come out in support.</p>
<p>Paimon voice actor Corina Boettger has been particularly vocal, <a href="https://x.com/thebirdzulu/status/1904948378838167802">stating on social media</a>: "There is a HUGE difference when you take the role of an actor who is striking for AI protections. You are no castmate of mine."</p>
<p>Replying to a response asking what to do in Hoyo's shoes, Boettger said: "I would sign the SAG interim agreement so that all my actors can have AI protections and then they could come back right away to voice these characters with no gap."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1904969482675884332">Albedo actor Khoi Dao</a> said: "Any video game can bring back their FULL voice cast IMMEDIATELY during the strike, once they agree to enforceable AI protections via a SAG interim agreement, and the game CAN still keep its non-union actors after doing so.</p>
<p>"This is not a union actor vs non-union actor conflict. The goal of the strike is to ensure that this craft isn't lost to AI. We've got a common goal, which is why so many NU actors are holding the line alongside their U cast mates, despite having no obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">similar situation with HoYoVerse's other game, Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Emeri Chase and Nicholas Thurkettle were recast due to the ongoing strike, and only found out once the game's latest patch went live.</p>
<p>Recording studio Sound Cadence Studios responded to the news at the time, stating: "Every contract at our studio features explicit AI protections, regardless of union status. Much of our staff are actors themselves, and could not in good conscience offer other performers work we would not be willing to take."</p>
<p>It added: "We respect the decisions of all actors in navigating the ongoing strike, and fully support SAG-AFTRA in its AI negotiations."</p>
<p>HoYoVerse itself is yet to publicly comment. Eurogamer has contacted the company for a statement.</p>

			<p>Mario Kart 9 may not be an instant smashing success on Nintendo Switch 2 due to the incredible popularity its predecessor still enjoys today, according to former Nintendo of America employees.</p>
<p>In a new video, former Nintendo of America employees Kit and Krysta discussed the next entry in the series, which was the only game shown during the brief Nintendo Switch 2 reveal back in January, saying that it may have a hard time matching the success of Mario Kart 8, at least in the beginning, due to how successful the game is and how it continues to be an extremely popular game due to the support it has received for years after release. Given how difficult it may be for a kid, for example, to convince a parent to purchase a brand-new system just to play Mario Kart 9, which may not look that different from its predecessor to the uninitiated eye, the two former Nintendo employees think that it will be difficult for the game to do better than the 75 million copies the game sold to date combining the sales of the original Wii U release and the Deluxe Switch release. An amazing result, considering how the Switch port was almost an afterthought after the sales of the Wii U release, which were far from amazing.</p>

<p>While much of the Nintendo Switch 2's launch success will likely rely on Mario Kart 9, it's unlikely the new entry in the series will be the system's only<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/"> first-party launch title</a>.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> turns 10 years old this week, and developers Obsidian are celebrating with a patch that "addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more". Oh, and they've also announced plans to give the real-time-with-pausing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> a turn-based combat mode. 
</p>
<p>
What did you get for your 10th birthday? If it wasn't a turn-based combat mode, then your parents officially love you less than Obsidian does Pillars Of Eternity. You might want to bring that up at the next family gathering. I'm already texting my dad.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The forum post revealing all this shares little about how the new turn-based system will work, but I think we can all agree that developers should capriciously add turn-based modes to games more often. I, for one, hope to see more development teams digging up ancient real-time games and sadistically grafting on initiative stats and order bars, like Frankenstein wannabes going through a Clockwork phase. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine if instead of a bunch of cannabis-skinned AK47s and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">seemingly AI-generated anime women</a>, the next Call Of Duty content plop transformed Warzone into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. Imagine if Street Fighter had a dual-turn system derived from deckbuilders, with players queuing up attacks simultaneously. (This has been done, yes? Surely it's been done. One of the Puzzle Fighter variants, perhaps.)</p>
<p>With hand on heart, I cannot think of a real-time game I wouldn't love to rediscover as a turn-based game - it worked out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-review">wonderfully</a> for Gears Of War. Admittedly, this is partly because I am very elderly for a games journalist and now fear and despise any game that expects me to outmaneouvre anything faster than a soap bubble.
</p>
<p>
The other positive here, I guess, is that it's a smidgeon of reassurance for people who worry that the Pillars universe will be first-person real-time from here on out, given the apparent success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. Perhaps Avowed will get a turn-based mode next? Something in the vein of Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, perhaps? Anyway, Obsidian will be soliciting playtesters for their new mode "in the near future". As for that new patch, <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the full changelog is here</a>.

            <p>Join us today to watch the Nintendo Direct, live at 2pm UK time (that's 7am PT, or 10am ET for those of you watching in America).</p>
<p>As a reminder, this Direct is focused solely on the original Nintendo Switch. So don't expect any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> news - that's being saved for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-time-where-to-watch">next week's Direct on 2nd April</a> instead.</p>
<p>What can we expect? Will those rumoured Zelda remakes make an appearance? Will we see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> as a cross-gen game? Or, dare I say it, Silksong?</p>

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will get additional content for free sometime in May, the game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543353138838503653?l=english"> Dev Note post</a> detailing the game's very first balance patch, Creative Director Junho Lee confirmed that a free DLC content update will be released sometime in May. As the new content is still in development, more details will be shared once it's closer to completion. Additional updates featuring some unspecified improvements will also be released in the near future, some of them as early as next week.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new The First Berserker: Khazan balance patch was released today to mark the game's official release following a few days of early access. As part of an effort to keep the game challenging yet fair, the developers introduced some balance adjustments, which include increased damage for the Greatsword Brutal Attack skill, a resource cost adjustment for the Phantom: Heatwave Spear skill, some boss balance adjustments, such as reduced difficulty for the Viper and Maluca boss fights, increased power of certain bosses that felt weaker than they should have, improved benefits for Easy Mode and more.</p>
<p>While I found The First Berserker: Khazan to be a balanced game overall, I had very little doubt that the Maluca boss fight would be adjusted following release, as it was one of the most difficult bosses in the game, requiring excellent knowledge of all the defensive options the game has to offer. Hopefully, these balance adjustments will help more players get into the game, as it is an action RPG that is more than worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/"> review.</a></p>

As of today, March 27, it's available on platforms that didn't even exist when the game debuted: smartphones and tablets for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backyard-baseball-97/id6740349666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2qZH_9nmCyxb_gYycCVhW6c_EkcZ7D4nV6wUaS0rLtlduYRXJlQEKO9VrtjxDjgkG7qOl0nm5osbFrVa6FRG2OJlnHemcvfzxPRwVOwnQGD_6ZuKpxnbHczwY_sefEb6hkEsB3MF8urEEvhIXgEf5uJtAkaJepkZ5khP36cvCJ-888oPviaCc0RxJYIuNjd08NMgMOBK9-o392kjvEQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Android</a>.</p><p>Backyard Baseball '97 brings the same experience you might know from PC to smartphones and tablets, featuring touch controls and a few on-screen buttons that replace things like the ESC key that pauses the game on PC.

In subsequent installments, the games tackled a variety of sports like football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and even skateboarding. Reboots of the series have occurred several times since then, first in the PS2 era with 3D takes on the formerly 2D series, and then again a few years later with a pair of Xbox 360 exclusives. A new game in the series hasn't been seen since 2015's pair of mobile-only sequels that were later removed from mobile stores.</p><p>Though Backyard Baseball '97 (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-soccer/" data-ref-id="5000-6785">Backyard Soccer '98</a>) doesn't feature real-life pro athletes, some later games did when they originally debuted, and Playground Productions has indicated at least some of these players will be returning to future revivals as they release.</p>

        <p>17 people let go, including a senior combat designer</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to <a href="https://spr.ly/l/6010F8AdQ">a social media statement</a>, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by <a href="https://x.com/TheMarkVernon/status/1905041591141802451">this Xitter post</a>, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.)
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">wrote Graham last year</a>. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year."
</p>
<p>
Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">being published by Amazon Games</a>, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Embracer announced plans last year to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">split themselves three ways</a> in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion</a>. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises.
</p>
<p>
Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has today added its latest booster pack, Shining Revelry, and alongside it a new card only obtainable by purchasing with real money.</p>
<p>The new booster pack adds a further 72 cards to be collected, as well as a fresh set of Deck Missions and Themed Collections.</p>
<p>Yet in the store is a new bundle under the Premium section, which includes a unique promo Mewtwo EX card. The bundle costs £18.49.</p>

<p>The bundle also includes a Shiny Mewtwo coin, playmat, and card sleeve, as well as a Shiny Radiance frame and cover, plus a bunch of gold.</p>
<p>Still, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a bundle rather than being obtainable the usual way by opening booster packs.</p>

<p>For those looking to complete their deck, you'll need to cough up the £18.49 for the privilege - at least for now. Perhaps the promo card will be introduced elsewhere in the future.</p>
<p>Another bundle has also been added for the same price, though this does not include a unique card. Instead it has accessories designed around Sinnoh region champion Cynthia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the update has altered the Wonder Pick animation - it's now much quicker, perhaps to stop players guessing their order.</p>
<p>Shining Revelry, as the name suggests, adds a number of shiny Pokémon to the digital card collecting game, including a black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Ranked Matches will also join with this booster pack</a>, with the first in-game session beginning tomorrow, Friday 28th March.</p>
<p>Later this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">trading feature will be overhauled following a backlash from players</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit and a huge-seller, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchises fortunes are Kalypso Media, who purchased Commandos back in 2020 and immediately announced a completely new entry in the series. That game, Commandos: Origins, is fast-approaching release. Developed by Claymore Game Studios, we were lucky enough to be invited to see some new gameplay and, boy-oh-boy, based on current evidence Commandos fans are in for a treat; Commandos Origins looks excellent!</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting in an Allied Prison, deep in Africa, the demo immediately introduces us to the Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the Prison complex, each utilising their unique abilities to help the other to their objective. The stealth mechanics appear reliable and accessible, with obvious viewing cones showing what your foes can see, allowing the Commandos to slip past unnoticed. The game even depicts visual sound waves, so you know exactly who will be alerted if you opt for a noisy takedown.</p>
<p>So far, so prescriptive stealth game. Things get way more interesting when the Germans invade the prison. Tanks smash through walls, soldiers shoot it out on the streets, and captured Allied soldiers are held at gunpoint; rather than escape, it’s up to the Commandos to save their comrades. Suddenly, the game becomes open and free-form, numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves. Do you sneak past the tank, then double back to destroy it with a bomb? Perhaps knocking some loose masonry on an unsuspecting Nazi’s head is the way to go? Maybe you should help a squad of Allied soldiers pinned down by taking out a sniper for them? Or just pull out your machine gun and go wild? Possible strategies are interesting and varied, and many objectives, it seems, are entirely optional.</p>


<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters with smooth animation crawling through debris, kicking down doors, or garrotting Nazis. Talking of successfully garrotting Nazis, you can pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly conceived plan carried out to, well, perfection. In a later snow-covered level, we see the Sniper eliminate a German Official, whilst the iconic radio left by the Green Beret lures another solider to their doom; all carried out with precise military efficiency.</p>
<p>Levels in general are going to be humongous, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Indeed, we are promised levels that take several hours to fully complete (and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters). There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, as we see the Green Beret clamber across a telephone wire to sneak past an electrified fence; how such a thin wire could support the weight of this hunk of man is beyond us, but he certainly looked cool doing it.</p>
<p>All of the iconic Commandos return, a highlight seems to be the spy, who can impersonate German Offices – and other characters – to move freely round the map. Though the Driver promises to provide much merriment, thanks to his ability to take control of German hardware, so surely blowing up some troopers with their own Panzer will be an option?</p>

<p>To our mind, the only question mark remains the quality of the controls on console. When quizzed on how they approached implementing the controller into a game that is best suited for mouse and keyboard, Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director of Claymore Game Studios, stated that there were challenges but remained tight-lipped over the solution.</p>
<p>Still, there was plenty of Commandos brilliance on display in our all too brief time checking out the game, leaving us salivating for the chance to try Commandos: Origins ourselves. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/commandos-origins-gets-a-sneaky-april-release-date/">the game launching on 9th April</a>, we don’t have long to wait to do so.</p>

Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $59.99 and the Iconic Edition priced at $79.99. All pre-orders will receive the F1 75 Celebration Pack (suit, gloves, and livery). The Standard Edition also gets the F1 World Starter Pack (10K cash and F1 World Resources) and 5,000 PitCoin. The Iconic Edition, on the other hand, will receive:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>F1 25 includes Braking Point 3, the latest chapter in the series' story mode, with Konnersport now battling for championships as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point 3 comes with multiple difficulty settings in an attempt to cater to returning vets and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>The popular My Team game mode has been improved. Players will now be calling the shots as the owners of their F1 team. On the track, F1 25 will feature the latest version of the EGO engine, which Codemasters says will deliver enhanced circuit authenticity powered by LIDAR technology. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed in the coming weeks through the F1 25 Deep Dive series. Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters, said:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory. This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059520/F1_25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for F1 25 also lists the game's minimum and recommended requirements.&nbsp;<span>By the way, they're nearly identical to those listed for&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a></span>, so don't expect big visual improvements.</p>
