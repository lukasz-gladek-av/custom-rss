And, if you’ve been confused where your Photo Mode images go, wonder no more: The file path is now shown in game when you take screenshots, and file names are simplified (with the date now included). You can also bind your arrow keys to input mappings now.</p><h2 id="h22718"><a id="gamepay"></a>Gameplay Changes</h2><p>As far as gameplay goes, you can now compare new rings against currently equipped rings in <em>either </em>slot, and the Glint option description is a little different. Some weapons got new icons to help differentiate them, and it’s easier to see where your companion’s Enchantments are.</p><figure id="" data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Extended dodge also won’t get weirdly wonky for Rooks of the ‘Mage’ persuasion., Some skill text has been changed to be more clear (and accurate), and Antaam Champions do a bit more damage (as intended), and instances where enemies and companions would get stuck or in out-of-reach places have been alleviated. Speaking of fixes, that brings us to the bugs that Patch 3 aims to squash.</p><h2 id="h22719"><a id="bugs"></a>Bug Fixes</h2><p>All kinds of bug fixes are included, but not all of them will have obvious or substantial effects. The general focus is on fixing issues encountered during cutscenes, mesh and polygon interactions, and some incredibly minor balance adjustments to get some items to work as they were originally intended to.</p><p>Getting into specifics, Rook won’t suddenly change body shapes or adopt strange expressions during or after certain cutscenes. Some other cutscene issues were fixed as well, including strange, stretchy cloaks and clothing clipping through the character. The patch also addresses times where music would randomly stop playing or the wrong sound effects or songs would play.</p><figure id="" data-id="e96fa1e75cad52debe8e2a3847748641" data-recommend-id="image://e96fa1e75cad52debe8e2a3847748641" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows character selections in Dragon Age." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows character selections in Dragon Age." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e96fa1e75cad52debe8e2a3847748641" data-recommend-id="image://e96fa1e75cad52debe8e2a3847748641" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows character selections in Dragon Age." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pop-in issues and camera stutters have been addressed as well, and your preferred HDR settings will now save properly (finally). </p><p>Issues involving the Codex, skill trees, quests, merchant inventory, quest objectives and cinematics, exploration, loading autosaves, really bright visual effects, stat buffs, and weapon modifiers have been fixed.</p><p>As a little bonus, some characters and environmental textures have been touched up to look better.</p><hr><p>There is a ton to do in Thedas, and with this patch landing your journey should go a bit more smoothly. Get back out there, Rook, and put that photo mode through its paces for me.</p><p>You can find the full patch notes on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-3-release-notes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-3-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official blog post</a></span>.

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved strategy games. It started as real-time strategy matches against AI opponents in titles like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, and Company of Heroes. I quickly found myself drawn to base-building and colony sim titles for the sense of progression and expansion they offer, though, and few compare to RimWorld. But then, there’s also Oxygen Not Included. They’re both exceptional, both offering countless hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of hours of gameplay. Which do you choose? Why not both? You can score two of the best colony sim games for under $35 with the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/46465/Terraform_Titans_Duo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Terraform Titans Duo</a> bundle on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rimworld">What is RimWorld?</h2>



<p>RimWorld is often considered the quintessential colony sim game, following in the footsteps of titles like Dwarf Fortress but offering a unique spin on the story generation mechanics. You’ll take control of a science fiction-fueled colony full of intelligent pawns that must contend with unique enemies, flora, fauna, psychology, climate, interpersonal relationships, and more.</p>



<p>After spending 1,000 hours playing the game, I can tell you that even the base version is worth every penny. But with the expansions and countless mods, you’ll easily score hundreds of hours from RimWorld if it’s your type of game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-oxygen-not-included">What is Oxygen Not Included?</h2>



<p>Also in the bundle, we have Oxygen Not Included. It’s another sci-fi colony sim game that focuses on the dynamic crew as they overcome obstacles, like alien lifeforms while harnessing the power of the asteroid they’re currently stranded on. For instance, you must consider logistics, like piping water and waste to and from the colony, to ensure no one falls ill. It’s complex and compelling in equal measures.</p>



<p>With ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews, Oxygen Not Included is a grand time for any colony sim or base-building game fan!</p>



<h2 id="h-score-them-both">Score Them Both!</h2>



<p>With this partnership between Ludeon Studios and Klei Entertainment, you can currently score both colony sim games for less than $35. Oxygen Not Included is on sale, dropping the price of the bundle to its current total. You really cannot pass this one up!</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below if you grab the bundle! Don’t forget to stop by and share screenshots of your colony in our General Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you know it can cost up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$500,000 for a spot on Opening Night Live 2025</a>? That’s an insane price to pay, and many indie developers can’t afford such extreme advertising costs!</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fortnite-remix-finale-event-featuring-juice-wrld/1100-6527953/" data-ref-id="1100-6527953">Fortnite Chapter 5 and Remix Finale event</a> takes the stage in-game on November 30, it will feature a pack of four iconic musical artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD. Like previous in-game concerts, such as those starring Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, the event is likely to be a kaleidoscopic audiovisual roller coaster. Still, by including the late Juice WRLD, who passed away in 2019, this in-game concert will also be decidedly different from any before seen in Fortnite: It will be the first to use an artist's likeness posthumously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-defends-use-of-a-i-in-new-movie/1100-6525952/">something that Hollywood is also grappling with as of late</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently spoke to Nate Nanzer, Epic's head of global partnerships, in a music-focused interview that hit on the developer-publisher's decision to bring Juice WRLD to Fortnite. Nanzer told me Epic had long hoped to do something like this with the late artist and explained why the company feels now is the right time.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something that our players have been asking for for years and years and years, and we've wanted to do it, but we wanted to find the right moment," Nanzer said. "We obviously want to do it in the most respectful way possible. We worked very closely with his mom and his label, and we were able to find the right moment where it felt right, around this event, and he has new music coming out, so all the stars kind of aligned around this moment."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer mentioned that Juice WRLD himself was "a big Fortnite player," and though the Epic executive didn't say this, it stands to reason that Juice WRLD would want to be in the game if he could say so today. Still, even with the involvement of his family and his music label, for some, the inclusion of a deceased artist's likeness in this manner may always cross a line. In the movie world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-plans-to-sue-anyone-who-makes-an-ai-replica-of-him/1100-6527453/">Robert Downey Jr. recently said he plans to sue anyone who tries to create an AI replica of his likeness</a>, and that even if it were to occur after he has died, his "law firm will still be very active." Events in 2012 surely predate many of Fortnite's biggest fans, but the Juice WRLD concert also recalls the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbrFmPBV0Y">Tupac "hologram" that once performed at Coachella</a>. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773" data-ratio="0.6015625" data-width="896" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773"></a><figcaption>Epic says players have begged for a Juice WRLD in-game concert, but when--if ever--is the right time for it?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the Fortnite world, I haven't personally seen a lot of pushback to Juice WRLD's involvement in next weekend's event. Certainly, there have been some feelings of ethics-based squeamishness, but the prevailing sentiment on places like the game's subreddit and popular Discord servers is one of excitement, perhaps owing to the often younger player pool in Fortnite. Whereas older players and onlookers may see this as a line being crossed, younger players who have spent years growing up within Fortnite may more quickly accept this as a marvel of modern technology, and they may be excited to finally have the Fortnite Juice WRLD event Nanzer says has been one of the community's most requested.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our community loves his music. We have data [that shows he is] still extremely popular. And I would say, I can't quantify this, but when I look at Reddit threads, or Discord chats, or Twitter threads, Juice WRLD comes up over and over and over again. I mean, people have made Juice WRLD concerts in Fortnite Creative and [Unreal Engine for Fortnite]."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer added that he feels fans of the late artist will come out of the event with positive feelings. "We're hopeful. We know our players have been asking for it, so there's a lot of pressure to really deliver it the right way. I think people are really gonna love what we have coming, like, I think it's done in an awesome way. I think if you're a Juice WRLD fan, you're gonna feel good about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">The debate over when it is or isn't acceptable to use a deceased person's likeness won't end when Fortnite Chapter 5 does next weekend, but Nanzer told me the company wants "music to permeate everything in Fortnite," which likely means this isn't the last time Fortnite will court controversy, even unintentionally, as it strives to fulfill its vision of a multimedia metaverse. In fact, there are already rumors that a future Fortnite collaboration will revolve around XXXTentacion, a musical artist who was murdered in 2018 at the age of 20.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is a tastemaker on a global scale. Much of the games industry over the past half-decade has been mired in chasing lucrative trends that Fortnite started or had massive success with. Once meant to be nothing more than a survival game, Fortnite is today an increasingly hard-to-define platform that doesn't merely feature pop culture; it shapes it. As Epic continues down this path of making the ultimate <em>everything</em> experience, it's inevitably molding what the future looks like, whether we're ready to live there or not.</p>

But as much as <em>The Veilguard </em>can be defined by its similarities to games of the past, so, too, is it notable for its differences.

Is it an anthology putting multiple heroes into a game of hot potato with the universe’s crises? Or could it learn a thing or two from its science fiction sibling <em>Mass Effect,</em> and commit to being a series built on choice and consequence rather than feeling burdened by it? More so than past games, <em>The Veilguard </em>positions the series to go either way, and its failings are evidence that BioWare needs to make a decision one way or another as it moves on to whatever comes next.</p><figure id="" data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare’s messaging on why it made the call to shave cross-game connectivity down to three choices and a character creator has been spotty, with the team claiming they only imported choices <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they could meaningfully represent</a></span>. <em>The Veilguard </em>gives us a new, heavily customizable protagonist in Rook, a mercenary recruited by fan-favorite party member Varric, and it takes place in the northern regions of Thedas, far removed from the events of the previous <em>Dragon Ages</em>.

Overall, we still get a flattened version of that character, one who arguably should have been the protagonist fighting against Solas, the ex-party member turned antagonist. I played my Inquisitor as a resentful atheist dragged into a holy war, but the man who bears his title in <em>The Veilguard</em> only resembles him in voice, not beliefs. In a vacuum, I don’t blame BioWare for not being able to match the very particular story I wrote in my head with a pre-defined character. But that problem could have been solved if I had been controlling him this time around.<br></p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>only imports three choices, but it doesn’t feel fully disconnected from games of the past. A lot of its narrative comes from worldbuilding we’ve watched unfold over 15 years. Multiple characters like <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ Witch of the Wilds Morrigan, <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s storyteller Varric, and <em>Inquisition</em>’s Tevinter pariah Dorian make appearances throughout the game in roles of varying importance. BioWare carefully writes around the specifics of what you might have done in previous games so each of these party members could have feasibly ended up where they have regardless of what you’ve done. The handling of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Isabela is more questionable, as dialogue in <em>The Veilguard </em>heavily implies she was recruited during the second game, though it’s possible to play <em>II </em>without her in your party if you don’t actually get around to asking her to join. This is a very specific scenario that few players probably ever saw, but it’s an example of how, even as BioWare tries to be respectful of past choices (largely by not bringing most of them up), some paths are bound to slip through the cracks.</p><figure id="" data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Admittedly this is the kind of nitpicking that only the sickest of sickos like me could ever engage in because we’re the only ones who even notice, but it’s the trap BioWare has set for itself. Establishing choice, consequence, and carryover as a pillar of your studio’s ethos means that fans can spend years imagining what their decisions might mean in the future, only for the reality to not match the theories that have been spreading through the community as what seemed like huge choices end up being a mere footnote in the grand scheme of things. Some of the biggest choices in previous games ended up funneling to the same outcome, and people were inevitably upset to see that magnified tenfold in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s limited import.<br></p><p>It’s clear that BioWare has aspirations that often get gradually chipped away throughout development as time and resources restrict what’s possible. Fans have datamined <em>Veilguard </em>files that imply some decisions that weren’t imported were meant to be at one point in production, and there’s an art book full of references to choices and consequences that never made it into the final game. Ex-<em>Dragon Age </em>writer David Gaider has been dropping bombs on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> about the logistics of recognizing different decisions in sequels. The actual, realistic possibilities of reactivity in these games will likely never match the expectations. Having existed in online BioWare spaces for over a decade, I know a lot of fans want a diverging main plot in response to their decisions, but that’s often not feasible given the budget and time constraints of AAA games.</p><p>That’s the promise we imagine when we talk about choice and consequence, right? Games like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>could be, in a perfect world, digital choose-your-own-adventure books or tabletop games that react to every little thing we do with an infinite number of outcomes and branching paths. But if that isn’t feasible, what is reasonable to expect?<em> Mass Effect</em>, despite its problems and some glaring exceptions, was able to deliver on some major choices by the time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span> rolled around thanks to its fixed perspective of protagonist Commander Shepard. <em>Dragon Age </em>has pulled off stunning moments like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334">Here Lies the Abyss questline</a></span>, but none of those change the core plot. Perhaps some disappointment over this is on fans for not having more measured hopes, but I can’t help but feel like <em>Dragon Age </em>is fundamentally ill-equipped to deliver the choice and consequence that BioWare’s pedigree has conditioned people to expect.</p><figure id="" data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dragon Age </em>is, ostensibly, an anthology. It jumps around the world of Thedas and, with each new entry, gives us a new protagonist to inhabit and a different problem to solve. Meanwhile, it also imports choices from previous games as it teleports us to the other side of the universe. <em>Dragon Age </em>has always wanted to have its cake and eat it too. The stories it tells are so directly tied to the people at their center that the protagonist switch that occurs with each new game has always felt like an arbitrary choice, not one that actually serves the tales it’s telling. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s flattening of the Inquisitor<em> </em>was the most damning example, but <em>Inquisition</em>’s transition from <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Hawke to the Inquisitor was hardly seamless. Corypheus, the antagonist of <em>Inquisition</em>, debuted in <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s <em>Legacy </em>DLC and was directly tied to the family lineage of Hawke. When the Champion of Kirkwall appeared in <em>Inquisition</em> as a customizable NPC, they were similarly flattened and also unwilling to stick around to solve the problem they’d started in the previous game. When the heroes we embody are so quickly discarded, even when they have deep personal ties to what’s going on, is it so surprising that the minutiae also falls down the chasm with them?<br></p><p>Now that <em>The Veilguard </em>has only imported three choices, none of which acknowledge the specifics of the larger world, it’s interesting to look at the game and realize that a lot of its big decisions feel more insular than those in previous games, like they might not need to be imported into the next one. Broadly, the main plot of stopping the elven gods doesn’t change no matter what you do, and even the final choice is more about deciding the flavor with which the same final event happens. Most of the variables you can alter happen within the story of <em>The Veilguard</em>, rather than the story of <em>Dragon Age </em>writ large. That isn’t to say the game isn’t gesturing toward the future; it’s just that there are fewer choices that feel like they’re being put on a shelf to be examined later, even as the game essentially wraps up most of the lingering lore threads of the past and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436">paves the way for a new conflict</a></span>.</p><p>All that being said, the final image we see in <em>The Veilguard </em>is a Marvel-esque tease indicating that the titular group “remains vigilant.” BioWare has already confirmed that it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has no DLC plans</a></span> for the game as it shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>, so whatever comes next, it sounds like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">the party</a></span> is going to play some part in the next game. And after seeing the way <em>The Veilguard </em>handled the Inquisitor, I don’t want the same fate to befall Rook, with them turned into another flattened version of a previous <em>Dragon Age </em>protagonist. If <em>The Veilguard </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">essentially wipes the slate clean</a></span>, BioWare has the opportunity to go one of two ways: doubling down on the anthology format that hasn’t worked for the series and gradually making choice and consequence a smaller pillar of its identity, or trying something more focused that doesn’t have to draw from every side of the universe but can better represent player choice.</p><figure id="" data-id="0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-recommend-id="image://0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-recommend-id="image://0c0ffef770bdba4e55958edfbefed283" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan, Rook, and the Inquisitor talk to Solas." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This has been my 1600-word lead-up to my real point: Rook should be the protagonist of the next <em>Dragon Age </em>game. Many of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s big decisions feel so tied to them, their relationships, and their experiences as a mercenary dragged into a leadership role, that they feel primed to serve as the face of the franchise moving forward. They’ve found alliances across all of northern Thedas, have storylines that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615">don’t seem tied up yet</a></span>, and their arc in <em>The Veilguard</em> seems destined for more stories. Just because <em>Dragon Age </em>has handed off old conflicts to new heroes with each new game in the past doesn’t mean it has to keep doing so. If BioWare wants a fresh start, it’s the perfect time to try something new.<br></p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s biggest problem with continuity was never that carrying choices over in a meaningful way was impossible, it was that its constant expansion in scope and shifting perspective made it more difficult to craft stories that satisfactorily reflected the choices made. <em>The Veilguard </em>can serve as a new beginning. Letting it<em> </em>function as a kind of narrative starting point from which to branch out, along with letting Rook provide a consistent perspective through which we can experience the chapter or chapters to come, all approached with more forethought than we’ve seen the series demonstrate in the past, would be the best use of this game’s potential.</p><p>If we’re shedding the old to make way for something new, it’s worth examining the shortcomings of the past. I don’t know what BioWare has planned for the next <em>Dragon Age</em>, but I would love to see the studio take a leap of faith with a hero who hasn’t been sanded down into an NPC yet. <em>Dragon Age </em>has had multiple chances to find its own Commander Shepard. The best time to do it would have been when the Inquisitor was in the spotlight ten years ago. The next best time is right now. Rook spends all of <em>The Veilguard </em>learning to be a leader, and now that the training wheels are off, maybe it’s time to let one person steer the ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is a big open-world FPS that is all about surviving extreme situations with very few resources in a digital recreation of the very real Chornobyl Exclusion Zone filled with (not real) mutants, monsters, and mercenaries. And while you might not be shocked to hear that in this harsh and painful video game world you sometimes have to kill wildlife, you might be surprised by how often it ends up being a dog at the end of your barrel. </p><p>Within the first 20 minutes of booting up <em>Stalker 2</em> on Xbox Series X I was forced to gun down a dog that attacked me in the  prologue. I didn’t think much of it, but I also don’t really mind killing <em>anything </em>in a game. Perhaps I’m a cold bastard. Perhaps its because I grew up in a rural area where animals died frequently due to coyotes, cold, and so on. Not sure. </p><p>But as I continued to play, more dogs kept getting killed. And even I, a cold-blooded monster in video games, started to feel weird about it. </p><p>Sure, the dogs in<em> Stalker 2</em> are mutated a bit, but they still growl, bark, and whimper when shot, and they look an awful lot like a dog you might have as a pet, so it still might be uncomfortable for some.</p><p>For example, right after the prologue/tutorial section wraps up, a cutscene plays in which a dog bites your character’s foot and wakes you up. Before he can shoot it, the poor animal is grabbed by a weird radioactive anomaly and spun into an explosion of blood and skin. </p><p>Then, I had to kill a few more dogs on my way to a town where I could get quests, buy and sell loot, and stash some of my stuff. I wondered if there were other enemies in the game. (There are and <em>oh god</em> they are deadly and scary.)</p><p>Once I reached town and watched a few cutscenes, I talked to a bartender and asked about work. He gave me two missions, one of which involved tracking down some stray dogs and killing them. Then, after I left the bar and explored the town, a different NPC called out to me and asked I wanted to help out with a job. The job? Killing a pack of dogs. At this point, I did start to wonder if everyone in this town hated dogs. </p><p>Leaving town to do a different quest involving a person hiding from a few different groups, I tracked down a possible location for the target. I arrived and ran into bandits who just so happened to have a bunch of wild dogs in their base. I mean, I assume they were wild strays because when I killed them after they attacked me, nobody in the base cared at all. Perhaps they’re even more coldhearted than me?</p><p>This all happened in the first 3 to 4 hours of <em>Stalker 2.</em> As I continued to play, the dog killing became a bit less common, but they are an enemy you’ll run into a lot and NPCs will ask you to kill them during (what I think are) randomly generated quests. </p><p>So if the idea of killing a dog in a video game makes you squeamish or it just sounds like a shitty experience, than I’d recommend not playing <em>Stalker 2</em>. And if you do enjoy killing dogs in games, that’s...weird, but uh, boy, this new game is for you! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a perfect time for Iron Wolves to be thankful as Destiny 2's Iron Banner event will make its return next week. The Iron Banner usually brings along new weapons and ornaments, and this event will be no different as it introduces both a new armor set and rocket sidearm into the the loot pool. </p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-11-21-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny</a> announcements, the name of the armor set was revealed--Iron Intent--with pieces "worthy of Weyloran, Nirwen, and Orewig" themselves. Players will know those names as great Iron Lords, who've all had weapons and ornaments named after them throughout the years. The Iron Banner will return to the game starting on November 26, with the match type of Control for the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765"></a><figcaption>The new Iron Banner armor set, Iron Inent, for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg"></figure><p>The armor has a Norse-adjacent aesthetic with the Titan helmet almost looking like a hammer with the Warlock mask having studded horns. All three have intricate braiding embossing up and down the plates. Destiny has had similar ornaments before with the Valhund set, but still very different in presentation.</p><p>Along with the Iron Intent set, the announcement teased the first-ever Stasis rocket sidearm. It also revealed that it would be possible to get the weapon with the Loose Change perk with Chill Clip perks. As Iron Banner events are now two weeks long, there's plenty of time to get the perfect roll on the new weapon. The few rocket sidearms in the game have proven to be excellent, and the current Artifact has a lot of Stasis weapon-centric perks, so it should be a pretty desirable weapon. </p><p>The previous Iron Banner brought new versions of old favorites, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-claws-of-the-wolf-god-roll-guide/1100-6524666/" data-ref-id="1100-6524666">Claws of the Wolf</a> pulse rifle and Crimil's Dagger hand cannon. This will be the last time the banner is raised and Lord Saladin's sigil is lit during this episode, and if you missed out, it's a great time to make your enemies hear the howls and know fear.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Songs Of Silence Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/songs-of-silence-rules.1042356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Songs Of Silence</em>, man, where has this game been hiding? Last week I had never even heard of it. For the week since I have been doing nothing but playing this game.</p><p>It's a strategy game I've seen billed as everything from a 4X to an auto battler, and many other things in between (I'll take my own swing at what it is in a second). Set in a fantasy world where two races of ancient humans have battled so long they've literally split the world in two, you can play skirmish maps or fight your way through a narrative singleplayer campaign that features both sides caught in a war that threatens to destroy them both.</p><p>For all the tags and descriptors being thrown around about this game--it comes slightly out of left field, so it's difficult to precisely pin down--I'd say the overall experience is closest to playing a <em>Total War</em> campaign if you'd given the <em>Total War</em> series to an engineer and said "trim as much of this as you can while still keeping the overall vibes". Your objective in every <em>Songs of Silence</em> game, whether in the campaign or a skirmish map, is broadly the same: take and hold settlements on a strategic map, which accrue resources you then spend on upgrades, unique buildings or new units.</p><p>Leading your armies are hero units, which in RPG style are unique and can be levelled up, and who also have special abilities they can employ on the battlefield. The armies themselves, meanwhile, are made up of a wild variety of fantasy units ranging from cheap infantry through to expensive, gargantuan behemoths. See what I mean? I'm basically describing the outline of <em>Total War: Warhammer</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yENpBzdm5PE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Only<em> Songs of Silence</em> does away with so much of <em>Total War's</em> faff. Diplomacy? Boring, so it's gone. Trade? Little more than tick-a-box, so it's gone too. All that's left is the heartbeat of Creative Assembly's series: the elastic to-and-fro of armies manoeuvring about a map that's always just slightly too big for them to hold down, and settling things on the battlefield in real-time when two of those armies clash.</p><p>Which is the point where <em>Songs of Silence</em> starts to get <em>really </em>interesting,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> because it's an auto battler</a>. You're the one building the armies, deciding on their composition and arranging them into formation, but once a battle starts every unit will (mostly) run off and do its own thing, with the player left as a bystander. The only direct input you have on proceedings is to play cards, which is a lot more important than it sounds, because they're the lifeblood of <em>Songs of Silence</em>.</p><figure></figure><p>On the battlefield, each leader gets their own deck of cards with special abilities they can play, and as you progress through a game and level your generals up you'll earn both more and better cards. Defensive abilities, offensive abilities, spawning new units on the battlefield, slowing your opponent down–there's a ton of ways you can influence the battle, even if you're not micromanaging each unit individually.</p><p>As a serial auto-resolver in long <em>Total War</em> campaigns, this is great. Look, I appreciate all the work that goes into <em>Total War's</em> real-time battles, and in decisive moments I'll usually always take control of them and have a blast, but over the course of a sprawling campaign that could feature dozens or even <em>hundreds </em>of engagements, I just can't be bothered taking charge of <em>all </em>of them. <em>Songs of Silence's</em> brevity is a great middle ground here, as I get some involvement, but can then kick back and watch a battle unfold in what is sometimes just a matter of seconds.</p><p>Cards can also be played on the strategic map, replacing much of what other games would build into an interface full of buttons (<em>Songs of Silence's</em> screen is beautifully uncluttered as a result.). These can buff armies or, more commonly, allow you to build structures and improvements on your settlements. Wherever you play these cards, on the battlefield or the map, the act is immensely satisfying; there's a flashy animation and feel to dragging a card onto the map and seeing a big stone tower come roaring out of the ground.</p><p>This all comes together to create an intoxicating pace. You just glide through <em>Songs of Silence</em>, frictionless, from one task to the next, never stopping or needing to pause, dancing in rhythm between moving an army on the map, upgrading something then having a little fight. Management is brief, battles are short, it's like strategic tapas in a genre that's normally only interested in huge steaks.</p><figure></figure><p>Helping drive all this is the fact I could not ever take my eyes away from the screen. Just look at this game. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is <em>stunning</em>. The splash art, the character design, the illustrations punctuating the end of every battle, the card art, the animation of all your little armies zooming around, the unit design, the little sensory thrill of playing a card, it's all wonderful.</p><p>The old cliche isn't as robust as it once was--stuff like <em>Endless Legend</em> and even recent <em>Fire Emblem</em> games have helped--but strategic fantasy in video games is still too often a generic, nondescript thing, one series' elf blurring into another series' stout human infantry. Not here! This game looks like nothing else out there (well, maybe a little like <em>Banner Saga</em> if you squint), and the story it's telling, complete with fantastic voice-acting, is also one that's well-told. This game's got a <em>world</em>, and it is an interesting place to spend some time in.</p><p>I have no idea how this game flew under my radar for so long--I mean I do, games media is broken and Steam's discovery is almost useless because simply too many games are coming out--but hey, whatever, I found it eventually. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is one of the most refreshing strategy games I've played in a very long time, and an unexpected artistic triumph at that. It's ironic that it's an auto battler, a genre often derided for being so hands-off, because I've been glued to this all week long.</p><figure></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2023 sci-fi blockbuster was one of my personal top-10 games of the year but didn’t land on as many people’s lists as <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its fantasy-based sibling, however, <em>Armored Core VI</em> is a lot more straightforward with short missions and generous checkpointing that lets you focus on tough boss fights without worrying about backtracking or losing XP when you die. Plus the grim industrial vibes and anime mech drama are immaculate. </p><p>Who knows how long both games will stay on sale. The games aren’t currently discounted on the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts or Steam, though the digital discounts might be coming closer to Black Friday. So far FromSoftware hasn’t indicated if <em>Armored Core VI</em> will get its own <em>Shadow of the</em> <em>Erdtree</em>-sized expansion, but I’m still holding out hope that it eventually will. Maybe sometime in 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All in all, Helldivers 2 and Final Fantasy Rebirth VII did incredibly well, with both of them winning four awards each. Black Myth: Wukong also did reasonably well for itself, getting two awards during the ceremony.</p>

            <p>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I've yet to play any of them. I likely won't play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/">via Steam</a> soon.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is much akin to the previous games in the series. These are traditional roguelikes, in which you head into a randomised dungeon split across many floors and attempt to delve ever deeper using the resources you find along the way. It's also got some neat online features, such as the ability to rescue or be rescued by other players should you collapse on a particular floor, so that you can continue with that character.
</p>
<p>Serpentcoil switches up the setting, introduces somewhat rudimentary 3D graphics, and modernises the UI a little, but should otherwise be deeply familiar to anyone who has played previous games in the series.
</p>
<p>The last Shiren game was The Tower Of Fortune And The Dice Of Fate, which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a relatively recent game, given it launched on PC and Switch in 2020. Alas, no, it first launched on Nintendo DS in Japan in 2010, and in the west for the Vita in 2016. That makes Serpentcoil Island the first new game in the series for 14 years.
</p><p>Serpentcoil Island also launched on Switch back in January of this year, which means you can find out every detail about the game if you're so inclined. It was pretty well received, with Famitsu giving it 38 out of 40.
</p>
<p>Why won't I play it? Because I find my patience for traditional roguelikes has lessened, these days. I might have plunged into my last procedural dungeon. Whatever appetite I do have left, I'm saving for the far more ambitious and wild Caves Of Qud, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-teases-a-10-release-date-with-a-tricksy-riddle-about-beetle-moons">due a polished 1.0 release on December 5th</a>. I do continue to enjoy listening to others wax lyrical about these games though, so if you think I'm wrongheaded and I should give Shiren his due, please pen a passionate ode in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-reveals-new-stealth-gameplay-details.1042314/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Observe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIElO8_Jtec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Smoke Bomb" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ-AWZISiK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Grab Mechanic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4HB6S_Mew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive has announced it's banning mods from public online sessions, blaming them for a "non-negligible" amount of server instability seen by players - even those who don't have mods installed.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen incredible community engagement since launch, and we've noticed that some players have started to create and share mods for Space Marine 2," game director Dmitriy Grigorenko wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english">message to the community shared on Steam</a>. "Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity."
</p>
<p>
"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players," Grigorenko continued. "Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don't have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods."

<p>
As a result of the studio's findings, mods will be prohibited from all public online sessions once Space Marine 2's next major update arrives in December. "You will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed," Grigorenko emphasised. That doesn't mean the end for Space Marine 2 mods, however. Acknowledging them as "a source of fun and creativity", Grigorenko confirmed players can still use mods online in private Operations lobbies, and they'll also be permitted in custom Eternal War lobbies once launched.
</p><p>
"We will also be providing an easy entry point to our backend for games with mods installed," Grigorenkoso added, "so modders won't have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch." Additionally, the studio intends to give modders access to some of its own tools at a later date, "so they can develop mods with greater ease".
</p>
<p>
Space Marine 2's December update also introduces the Dark Angel Chapter Pack, the Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, plus a new PvE map set on Demerium, titled Obelisk. And if that's still not enough Warhammer to fill your December, Games Workshop recently confirmed Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">include an animated Space Marine 2 sequel</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nows-the-best-time-to-listen-to-aftermaths-52-pickup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professional DC Comics expert Alex Jaffe and I have been rereading the ambitious comic book <em>52</em> and podcasting about it. We’ve just reached the halfway point, and even if you haven’t read the series before, we think this is a great place to join us.</p><p>1985’s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> is a fantastic book on its own merit, but is also a fascinating look at DC Comics’ “events,” which are a way to both boost sales and resolve tricky editorial problems. Through this, writers and artists try to cohere the DC universe from something sprawling and inconsistent into a logical world with more concrete rules. DC has had dozens of such Crisis events, some more successful than others. <em>52</em> is a series that spun off of such an event, but is so, so much better than the circumstances of its creation.</p><p><em>52</em> was an experiment in American comics that worked exactly once. After the event <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, the DC universe jumped ahead in time by one year as a way to explain the new radical status quo for the characters. To help readers learn what happened in that missing year, four of the most popular DC comics writers–Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Grant Morrison–got together to put out a weekly series exploring the events of the DC universe in real time, week by week.</p><p><em>52</em> did not do a particularly good job of telling the editorially mandated story of that missing year, but it did something much better: it was a successful weekly comic book that revitalized several smaller DC Comics characters. For manga readers, that may sound like no big deal, but the American comic books industry does not have the infrastructure to support a weekly, full color comic book. As Jaffe and I have explored this comic in depth, we’ve learned how many times this project almost failed. Most recently, I learned that in one week, the line art got lost while in transit to the Brazilian studio that inked the book, and they had to do a rush job working off photocopies that were overnighted. The fact that this comic book was released on time every week was a miracle. The fact that it’s <em>also extremely good</em> almost defies reality.</p><p>If you haven’t read <em>52</em>, feel free to start at the beginning of the podcast and read along with us. If you just want to start listening, <a href="https://aftermath.site/52-pickup-podcast-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest, episode 27, is a great place to start</a>. Jaffe and I summarize each of the simultaneously running plotlines in the book. For Aftermath subscribers, we have a ton of bonus episodes for people who want to know more about the projects that spun off of <em>52</em>, including many aspects of the DC extended universe movies (except the Zach Snyder films, which Jaffe will not watch unless he personally receives three thousand dollars). We’ve also spoken to artists who have worked on <em>52</em>, including Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, and Geoff Johns. I have not given up on interviewing Grant Morrison, and if anyone has their contact information please do reach out.</p><p>Understanding <em>52</em> is the key to unlocking the entirety of DC comics. It is an exercise in its star writers exploring their specific fixations, working with and around an editorial mandate, and following in the tradition of <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> to use fiction to solve other editorial problems. I doubt we’ll ever see a comic book like it ever again, but you may see adaptations of bits and pieces of this book in popular culture as James Gunn takes control of the DC movie universe. I mean, it already began before his tenure—The Rock’s <em>Black Adam</em> movie is directly inspired by the Black Adam storyline in <em>52</em>. But Gunn in particular has the same fondness for the freaks and losers of the DC universe as the writers of <em>52</em>, like Peacemaker, Vigilante, the Creature Commandos. His comic book inspiration for the upcoming <em>Superman</em> movie comes from a <em>52</em> writer, Grant Morrison. These are the kinds of stories and characters that truly differentiate DC from Marvel, and made a lifelong DC obsessive out of me.</p><p>Jaffe and I have already embarked on reading the second half of the series, where the narrative gets even weirder. I hope you’ll join us.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-eyes-buying-out-board-game-companies-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee Group plans on acquiring more board game companies. The global board game publisher's future was uncertain after its spin-off from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Embracer Group</a> and being saddled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">considerable debt</a>. But thanks to recent events, their new strategy is mostly unchanged from their old one.</p>

<h2>Asmodee Group's Future Acquisition Plans</h2>

<p>According to its Capital Markets Day <a href="https://ir.financialhearings.com/asmodee-cmd-2024" rel="nofollow">presentation</a>, Asmodee Group plans to restart its strategy of buying smaller board game publishers and distributors following their separation from Embracer Group.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=5LTGCh3k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-game-board-image.jpg?itok=KkimFzmJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This strategy is central to how the company has become one of the largest tabletop companies in the business. The broad group of companies under Asmodee's ownership includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-arkham-horror-lovecraft-letter-eldritch-twist-on-classic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Z-Man Games</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fantasy Flight Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-is-coming-to-board-game-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Catan Studios</a>.</p>

<p>In the presentation, Asmodee Group's CEO, Thomas Koegler, states they have a pipeline of more than 20 acquisition opportunites. Those opportunities include social and party game studios across the US and EU, and local distribution players to help strengthen their position in established companies.</p>

<p>According to Koegler, the acquisition targets being monitored are companies Asmodee knows well. Most of them are business partners the company interacts with on a daily basis spread across distribution and publishing. None of these companies were explicitly named.</p>

Those circumstances include being bought by Embracer Group in 2021. This was part of a string of purchases by Embracer, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive and The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-lord-of-the-rings-prototypes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> IP.</p>

<p>This came to an end when one of Embracer Group's deals fell through and they were saddled with <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/13/asmodee-owner-embracer-group-to-make-layoffs-to-help-tackle-1-5bn-debt-pile/" rel="nofollow">$1.45 billion</a> in debt. This lead to layoffs, selling studios, spinning off Asmodee Group and saddling them with €900 million in debt.</p>

<p>That debt is less daunting thanks to an investment by Embracer. As part of the proceeds of selling mobile game developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Easybrain</a>, Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-intends-to-contribute-eur-400m-to-asmodee-and-presents-asmodees-financial-targets-dividend-policy-and-net-financial-debt/" rel="nofollow">is investing</a>&nbsp;€400m into Asmodee Group.&nbsp;€300 million will go towards the debt, the&nbsp;€100 million remainder will go to strengthening their balance sheet ahead of their company listing, allowing them to continue their M&amp;A business strategy.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is making changes to how it handles stealth, versus other games in the long-running series. Gone is the companion eagle who can spot enemies for you, for a start; instead, players can hide in the - hey - shadows, lie on their tummies for the first time, and make use of a "shinobi and assassin arsenal" of smoke bombs and bells.
</p>
<p>There are old moves that are coming back after an absence, too: Shadows will allow for 'double assassinations' again.

<p>Ubisoft outlined their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/4478361902017151340">approach to stealth in a new blog post</a>, which also includes links out to brief illustrative videos.
</p>
<p>"For the first time in the Assassin's Creed series, hiding in the shadows will make you invisible to enemies. During nighttime, any pocket of shadows becomes a dynamic hiding spot in which you can progress without being seen. This applies to both interiors and exteriors," explains the post. "The ability to use shadows in this way invites you to carefully study your environment for hiding opportunities and routes... or create them yourself by destroying lanterns with a shuriken."
</p>
<p>Likewise, "Naoe and Yasuke are the first protagonists able to go prone in the series." While lying down, you can roll in any direction, crawl under certain buildings, and commit special ankle-based assassination attacks.
</p>
<p>The post mostly focuses on Naoe, one of Shadows' two protagonists, who will carry a smoke bomb, shinobi bells for tossing to distract guards, throwing knives called Kunai, and shuriken which can stun enemies. Yusuke seems to have a similar set of stealth capabilities, but with a different arsenal and some unique wrinkles that will apparently be outlined at a later time.
</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is the return of double assassinations, a one-time iconic feature of the series. "By equipping the Tanto as one of your main weapons and unlocking the dedicated skill, you can eliminate two enemies standing next to each other at once with your Hidden Blade - whether on the ground or from the air," says the post.</p>
<p>The various RPG mechanics of more recent games of the series still remain, however, so it's possible to try to have your attempt denied if you have neglected your "Assassin Hidden Blade upgrades". The assassination prompt will change colour to let you know the outcome in advance: white if it's an instant kill, yellow if you'll deal just some damage, and red if it won't work at all.
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was originally supposed to come out this year, but was delayed until February 14th, 2025 seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">at staff's urging</a> and in response to somewhat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">lukewarm sales of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Outlaws continues to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-latest-patch-is-out-and-aims-to-make-stealth-and-combat-more-satisfying">receive patches to improve its own stealth systems post-release</a>.
</p>
<p>I love a good lie down in a video game, so these changes sound appealing to me. I still hate that enemies can out-level a knife, though. My reward for the risk of getting close to an enemy, particularly a strong one, should be the ability to take them out in a single blow - although I realise that other philosophies of stealth may be valid also.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Increasingly, people have gotten in the habit of pre-ordering DLC too, paying up front for content that won’t be delivered for months or even years, if ever.

Anything that ends up delayed could then potentially be eligible for a partial refund. “By offering a Season Pass, you are promising future content,” the new guidelines to development partners read. “In the process of launching a Season Pass you will be asked to commit to a launch timing for each content release in the Season Pass. That launch timing is a commitment to both customers and Steam.”</p><p>  Steam adds that while game development is complex and challenging, with delays sometimes necessary and understandable, companies will only get to reschedule DLC and season pass release timing once. “If you aren’t ready to clearly communicate about the content included in each DLC AND when each DLC will be ready for launch, you shouldn’t offer a Season Pass on Steam,” the company writes. </p><p>In addition, season passes are supposed to include at least one piece of content that’s already accessible at launch unless it’s for a currently unreleased game. Even if there aren’t customer complaints in a given instance, Steam reserves the right to auto-refund players for any potential violations of the new rules. And if any DLC is cancelled outright, players will get the “value of unreleased DLC” refunded into their accounts instead of relying on whatever in-game currency or other make-good the companies promise instead. </p><p>It sounds like the sections on Steam store pages beneath the buy button that list all of the microtransactions included in a game are about to get even more chaotic to look at, but at least it will hopefully incentivize companies to be more conservative about what they promise and charge for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-naoki-yoshida-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What you need to know about the content rollout, how it's handling free-to-play, and more.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-mobile-announced-tencent">Final Fantasy XIV is coming to mobile</a> thanks to Lightspeed Studios raised plenty of questions among fans, including which content it will feature and how it will incorporate monetization. Now, Final Fantasy XIV Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida has answered at least some of these questions in a new video released exclusively to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we were keen on the idea of a mobile version, we had doubts about adapting some core aspects such as monetization and core gameplay to be more accessible to mobile users. Therefore, we provided challenging feedback to the Final Fantasy XIV Mobile dev team," Yoshida explains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida goes on to reveal that Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">indeed start with A Realm Reborn</a> — the original campaign that helped reboot Square Enix's struggling MMORPG back in 2013. The rest of the content will then be "released gradually based on player feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, Final Fantasy XIV and FFXIV Mobile will be developed and operated independently, with FFXIV naturally being ahead in its release schedule," Yoshida says. "However, we see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision. We will continue to provide guidance and feedback as the project moves forward, hoping that both versions will grow hand-in-hand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is the Final Fantasy XIV will be relatively similar to the PC and console version, though Yoshida does not say whether it will unify accounts or progression. In addition to "faithfully recreating the story for mobile users," it will incorporate elements like the Gold Saucer, Triple Triad, and crafting and gathering. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We see FFXIV Mobile as a sister title and we are thoroughly involved in its supervision</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the battle system, Yoshida doesn't offer many specifics on how it is being adapted to mobile, but does allude to its virtual joystick and how the actions are being tuned for touchscreen play. "In particular, when it comes to the battle system, which involves player parties, we had to adjust each duty and its mechanics to ensure players would have a satisfying experience. Our battle and content designers as well as myself personally played through early builds and provided feedback on how to create a multiplayer experience that would be enjoyable to mobile users."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the biggest difference between Final Fantasy XIV Mobile and the original release on PC console is that the former version will be fully free-to-play. However, that doesn't mean it will include "gacha" play or other exploitive mechanics. Instead, Yoshida says it will be geared toward encouraging "long-term engagement."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our goal is to ensure that players can enjoy Final Fantasy XIV for a long time while generating a small and sustainable revenue allowing as many people as possible to play the game. So, there's no need to worry too much — just dive in and enjoy the game," Yoshida says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida says that team will aim to gather feedback and begin conducting tests, including monetization in various regions globally. It will launch first in mainland China and gradually expand to a global release. In the meantime, Final Fantasy XIV continues to move head on PC and console, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail expansion having come out earlier this year</a>, and it sounds like there's still plenty more to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For us, there's no finish line," Yoshida says. "As long as I'm still around and haven't retired I will continue to give my all to Final Fantasy XIV."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Few video game developers have had to deal with the things that GSC Game World had to face while making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. The Ukrainian game developer behind this first-person shooter survival-horror title was derailed by Russia's invasion of its country in 2022. But the game was finally released earlier this month with some noticeable issues. Fortunately, a day-one patch has reportedly dealt with some of those problems, while others remain.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-tech-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer and Digital Foundry</a>, the patch arrived after reviewers had already played through Stalker 2. The good news is that this patch seems to have significantly helped the game's frame-rate performance. But the site notes that "the game still suffers from everything to minor, amusing bugs to more serious issues and heavy CPU utilization." On Xbox Series X, the game is said to occasionally freeze entirely for a few seconds when visiting large towns, before continuing with an erratic rate of frames per second.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHQ3jAeza60" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cHQ3jAeza60" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Overall, the first impression left by Stalker 2 remains positive. GameSpot's Richard Wakeling wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">Stalker 2 review</a> notes that it "boldly sticks to the studio's vision of a seamless open-world survival shooter, which the series has always strived to be. It's rough around the edges and uncompromising in a way that is sometimes off-putting. Yet the series' emergent gameplay remains intact and is further complemented by a fascinating setting and the most accomplished combat in the series so far." However, Wakeling also reiterated many of the technical issues stated above, as well as crashes and other bugs that hampered the experience.</p><p>Xbox released the behind-the-scenes documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> last month, which chronicles the ordeal that GSC Game World's team went through in order to complete the game during war time. Ultimately, many of the developers had to leave Ukraine to finish the development while others remained behind to fight for their country. That war continues to this day with no resolution in sight.</p>
