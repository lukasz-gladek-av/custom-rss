            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Robot Entertainment has revealed the post-launch&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and it includes a new War Mage, a new enemy type, and much more.</p>

<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement" rel="nofollow">announced last year</a>, launched for PC and Xbox Series X|S today, but Robot Entertainment isn't resting on its laurels. The developer took to Steam earlier today to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2273980/view/533214336538116486" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">share its vision</a> for where&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will go in the future.</p>

<p>In the post, Robot Entertainment organizes forthcoming updates into two categories: In the Works and Coming "Soon", and "The Road Ahead". It's probably not too difficult to guess what each category represents.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=Mhu4OMCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-roadmap-skeletons.jpg?itok=DGfyTDK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>has barely been out a few hours, but its developer has already shared the game's post-launch plans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the former category, Robot Entertainment promises a new War Mage in the form of Master Gabriella, who's appeared in previous&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>games as well. She'll have "an exciting kit of tricks" and will reintroduce Arcane magic into the game.</p>

<p>Next up, the Resort Canal map will ask you to defend two rifts simultaneously, and it'll take place in the game's Coastal biome. You can also look forward to a new Unstable Orc enemy, which takes a great deal of punishment before it dies to compensate for its slow movement.</p>

<p>Rounding out the Coming Soon category are an Alchemy lab, which will offer you buffs for each run, and a new Gnome Balloonist Sentinel, which will "add more ceiling space for traps".</p>

<p>As for the road ahead, Robot Entertainment says it plans to support&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>"for as long as possible", and that the studio has "ideas for a wide variety of content and features".</p>




<p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series, combining the franchise's traditional action-tower defense hybrid gameplay with a new roguelite-inspired approach and "deeper progression systems".</p>

<p>You can grab the game right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/orcs-must-die-deathtrap/9p0302f6v9vt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

The report follows <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1883938087446995432">teases made by the official Sims account on X</a> as part of a 25th anniversary celebrations roadmap, as well as a few other scattered hints in various bits of promo as collated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i1frue/the_sims_1_2_and_3_might_be_rereleasing_for_the/">Redditor skyline7284</a>.

<p>The first two Sims games released in 2000 and 2004 respectively, but neither domestic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation game</a> has been easy to play on PC for years. Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) had to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/returning-to-the-sims-1-in-2023-is-a-weird-challenge-i-fully-recommend">install The Sims on a Windows Vista machine</a> from 2008 to revisit it in 2023, and the Sims 2 has long been offline, with the last digital copies removed from sale in 2014 around the time that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> released.</p>
<p>The next Sims thing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">Project Rene</a>, is still in development, although EA have said that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">won't be Sims 5</a>, technically. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">they blogged last</a> September. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."</p>
<p>Paradox cancelled their own Sims competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a> last year, and laid off staff following what one developer called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-devs-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-prior-to-closure-says-laid-off-designer-despite-their-sim-like-exceeding-paradoxs-expectations">"a month in purgatory"</a>.

                <p>Dying Light developer Techland has ambitious plans for its zombie-apocalypse series, as the studio is looking to expand the franchise in the future.

                <p>Microsoft is one of multiple companies looking to strike a deal to take ownership of the popular social media app TikTok, according to United States president Donald Trump. Asked on Monday aboard Air Force One if Microsoft was in the mix to make a deal, Trump told reporters, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-microsoft-trump-ban-china-0335cb0e4f394db3c0a6f06a064c5e64" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including the AP</a>, "I would say yes."</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-value-jumped-by-77-billion-after-announ/1100-6480732/" data-ref-id="1100-6480732">Microsoft officially announced plans to buy TikTok</a>, which sent the company's share price surging. Microsoft later <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/09/13/microsoft-statement-on-tiktok/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">abandoned</a> its buyout attempt, with CEO Satya Nadella saying the deal was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-says-failed-tiktok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-worked-on-2021-09-28/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"strangest thing I've ever worked on."</a> Now, Microsoft may be back at the negotiating table.</p><p>Trump said other companies are in the mix to buy TikTok as well, but he didn't name them outright. It was previously reported that Activision founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980?AID=11557093&amp;PID=5835937&amp;SID=01HW8CZB4VGN2YZN49J1WFXY5Q&amp;subid=digidip&amp;cjevent=c4115b2d025211ef810600720a82b824&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=digidip&amp;tier_4=3743973&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fwhy-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bobby Kotick was assembling an investment group to buy TikTok</a>.

Trump recently extended the deadline for TikTok to find a new owner in the US by 75 days, with the deadline now being April 4.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about national security over TikTok based on the company's ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance.

			<p>A new year means another entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry’s flagship wrestling franchise</a>, and today 2K Games unveiled WWE 2K25. After a few years of relatively conservative updates, it seems like developer Visual Concepts is going all out with WWE 2K25, which adds a new island hub you can explore with up to 50 other players, a Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase mode, and a roster of over 300 Superstars, with no restrictions on who can fight who – yes, intergender wrestling is in. You can check out the first teaser trailer for WWE 2K25, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OTC is ready for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWE2K25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWE2K25</a>! ☝️☝️☝️ <a href="https://t.co/tx4p6Fj9Ks">pic.twitter.com/tx4p6Fj9Ks</a></p>
<p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href="https://twitter.com/WWE/status/1884080756705685505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And here’s a look at the game’s covers and some early screenshots…</p>

</figure>


<p>WWE 2K25 most standout new feature will likely be The Island, an online hub similar to ones seen in NBA 2K for years, in which you can interact with other players and complete various challenges. Interestingly, The Island will feature its own storyline, in which you vie to impress Roman Reigns that's completely separate from the usual MyRise story mode (which is still in the game). The Island will be exclusive for the current-gen Xbox Series X/S and PS5 versions of the game (it seems PC players will have to sit the feature out).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Bloodline Rules Showcase will open things up somewhat, offering three different types of matches – ones that let you relive history, ones that let you change history, and dream matches that never got to occur in real life. Want to know how a historic Bloodline member like Yokozuna might match up against the current roster? Now you can.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K25…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Match Types and Gameplay Improvements:</strong> Intergender wrestling makes its long- awaited debut in the WWE 2K franchise! WWE or player-created Superstars from the men’s and women’s divisions can now compete against each other to set up limitless matchups across all game modes. Additional features include the return of Chain Wrestling, Bloodline Rules Match, Underground Match, and new barricade diving! More details on each new match type will be shared soon.</li>
<li><strong>MyGM Online Multiplayer:</strong> Intrepid GMs can take their show on the road and challenge general managers worldwide in the enhanced MyGM for WWE 2K25, now with online multiplayer for up to four players. Players draft WWE Superstars and Legends to their weekly show’s roster and lead their brand through multiple-week seasons with a bigger selection of General Managers, cross- brand Premium Live Events, and more.</li>
<li><strong>MyRise:</strong> Players guide their Superstar from the women’s or men’s division in a singular, multi-gender MyRise storyline where Bayley, Kevin Owens, and other Superstars infiltrate NXT in an attempt to take control of the entire WWE. Featuring new personality choices that lead to specific storylines, as well as brawl environments, unlockable arenas, characters, useable objects, and more, plus new ally storylines involving Jey Uso, Bianca Belair, Seth Rollins, and other Superstars.</li>
<li><strong>Universe:</strong> WWE 2Ks sandbox mode receives upgrades to give players greater control over their Universe experience, including the long-awaited return of Promos! The new system includes multiple promo types and outcomes with new cutscenes and branching choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like WWE 2K25 is looking to mix up the formula a bit -- following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cautious but steady improvement</a> over the past few years, we'll see if the gambit pays off. As usual, WWE 2K25 will come in an array of different editions, including the basic standard edition for $70 on both current and last-gen consoles, the $100 Deadman Edition, and the $130 Bloodline Edition. Everyone who pre-orders any edition gets the Wyatt Sicks Pack, which includes characters Uncle Howdy, Dexter Lumis, Nikki Cross, Joe Gacy, and Erick Rowan. Meanwhile, here’s what’s included in the Deadman and Bloodline Editions of the game…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadman Edition</strong> – “Deadman Edition Bonus Pack” which includes Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Undertaker and Original Undertaker (‘90) Persona Cards and playable Superstars, a useable Urn object, Undertaker ‘95 Mask cosmetic item for The Island, and Brother Love Manager, plus a Season Pass to all five post-launch DLC character packs and 15,000 VC.</li>
<li><strong>The Bloodline Edition</strong> - All bonus content included in the Deadman Edition, the Ringside Pass (Season Pass plus Superstar Mega-Boost), The Rock Nation of Domination Pack, which features a Rock Nation of Domination Persona card and playable Superstar, plus The Bloodline Edition Bonus Pack, which features Mattel Elite Series 114 Jey Uso and Mattel Elite “Greatest Hits” Roman Reigns Persona cards and playable Superstars. Also Family Above All Hoodie, OTC Shirt, Yeet tank Top and Yeet Sunglasses cosmetic items for The Island, while for Steam only, it includes an additional 32,500 VC. Also included is the WrestleMania 41 Pack which features the WrestleMania 41 Arena, two WrestleMania 41 Main Event Superstars Persona cards and playable Superstars, and a new Superstar Persona Card (TBA), which will all be available Summer 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWE 2K25 hits PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who drop the cash for the Deadman or Bloodline Editions can play a week early on March 7. Look forward to a Wccftech preview and review of WWE 2K25 over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Dead Drop’s Workbenches in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 represents a big step up. The hand-holding is gone, and you need to go on a serious expedition to find all the Collectibles if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission 1’s Workbench Collectible</a> is child’s play compared to the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>. Dead Drop is the first big, open map to explore. It has 19 Collectibles to find—including three Workbenches. Finding these is imperative to give Harry the best chance of surviving the never-ending onslaught of German troops.</p>



<p>I’ve provided a simple and easy-to-use map showing you the locations of every Workbench, but if you need a few extra details with more specifics, we have that too.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-2-dead-drop">Every Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance Mission 2 Dead Drop</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Force your path. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The little Cog symbol represents a Workbench</strong>—and I’ve circled them for you anyway. Each one is equidistant from the other and they’re spread fairly well around the map. There’s no necessary route to take to find all of <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance’s Mission 2 Workbench locations, but I’ll provide my experience and how I found them.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-1-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 1 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s just behind this door. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Start Dead Drop and head to the broken stone bridge. Go left, and climb up the vines to get into a broken tower. Climb the tower, kill the guard, and head through the castle doorway. Pick up the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Propaganda Poster</a> on the stairs to your left if you haven’t already, carry on up, and go into the house. </p>



<p>Charge down both sets of stairs and exit the house left. Head West through the streets—doing your best to avoid becoming a human bullet sponge. <strong>Using the screenshot “Every Workbench Location” screenshot earlier</strong>, you can see the Workbench is found in a big building in the very Southwest quadrant of the level. Reach the building, and the Workbench is up the stairs and behind a locked door—after you pass through a mini-courtyard area.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-2-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 2 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go up to the courtyard and look left. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s time to head North from this building. Head left past the “<strong>Find Vertigo’s Dead Drop at the Balisca” Main Objective</strong> building. Pass through the gardens and keep running in a straight line—<strong>watch out for the Sniper ahead up high</strong> who can easily spot you. You should eventually reach a small flight of stairs to go down, situated next to a barbed-wire fence and locked door. </p>



<p>Go between the houses and run around to the entrance of <strong>the “Locate Vertigo’s Office” building</strong>. Head up to the main gate and into the courtyard. Immediately on your left is a locked door. Either open it manually or use Bolt Cutters. Inside is the second Workbench.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-drop-mission-2-workbench-location-3-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Dead Drop Mission 2 Workbench Location 3 in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Go through to the other side, and down the stairs. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the easiest way to reach Workbench three is to follow the natural road around the top of the map, sticking to the outside parts of the map and using walls for cover. <strong>Go past the “Find Stolen Resistance Files”</strong> area, and opposite it is a building with open doors.</p>



<p>Go through this doorway and the other open doors round the back. Turn right, and go down the stairs. Go right again, and you should see a locked door. Once more, either pick the lock, or use Bolt Cutters, go inside, and the Workbench is right there!</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope this guide was useful and you have all three Workbenches ticked off and added to your collection. I’ve put together other handy guides to help your Sniper Elite Resistance experience too: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All mission names</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is</a>.</p>

But, which Xbox game series get you most excited? Which gave you more enjoyment than any other in the glory days of the 360? Or if you’ve never owned an Xbox console, which are you most looking forward to coming to other platforms like PlayStation, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-starfield-coming-out-on-ps5-phil-spencer-wont-rule-it-out">Microsoft seemingly continues its plans to share its library with the world</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are many legendary game series to choose from (especially since Microsoft’s acquisitions of both Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. That means this tier list can include any series associated with Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard, as long as there has been more than one entry into it so far – sorry to MachineGames and Indiana Jones! Give us a sequel, please, and then you can make the cut. Just a reminder that this isn’t an <em>all </em>Xbox Game Series list, so we haven’t involved every single Xbox game series here, but have tried to cover the bases of current relevance and historical impact. Take a look at my personal tier list, based completely on what I’ve enjoyed playing the most over the years, here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/27/screenshot-2025-01-27-at-13-31-16-1737984696270.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Xbox Games Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom is an easy S-tier pick for me, with the past couple of entries being amongst my favourite first-person shooters, and I’m very excited to see that Doom: The Dark Ages looks like id Software is maintaining form. I’ve also placed Forza Horizon in the S tier as they’re, perhaps outside of Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge, the best racing games I’ve ever played. I’m sure Halo in the A tier may raise a few eyebrows, but while 2 and 3 are two of the finest campaign shooters ever made, I can’t ignore more recent inconsistencies and put it in that top bracket. I’m also more of a Fallout person than an Elder Scrolls one. I’d rather own a set of power armour than a dragon, OK?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think Gears of War is Xbox’s best? A big defender of Fuzion Frenzy? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of the Nintendo consoles yourself in a tier list below where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there an Xbox series we’ve missed that you’d like to give a shout-out to?

            <p>Roman Reigns will be the cover star for WWE 2K25, the next in the long-running wrestling series, alongside its largest-ever roster.</p>
<p>It will also include a new The Island mode to complete challenges in a bid to impress "The Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>The new game is set for release in March (7th or 14th, depending on edition) across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam, though The Island will only be available in the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p>

<p>The Island will be a world consisting of areas based on different WWE themes where players can complete quests, take on challenges, compete in live events, and upgrade MySuperstars characters through storyline chapters.</p>
<p>The game's roster, meanwhile, will include 300 wrestlers, including Superstars, Legends, and Hall of Famers - from John Cena and The Rock, to "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Trish Stratus and more.</p>
<p>Other additions include a third-person camera for online matches (controlled separately by each player); the 2K Showcase: The Bloodline's Dynasty mode celebrating the iconic wrestling family dynasty; intergender wrestling makes its debut across all game modes; and the return of Promos in the Universe mode.</p>
<p>The creation suite will also be updated as per each new game, which is considered one of the most detailed and robust <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators</a>.</p>
<p>"I am personally and professionally excited that the Original and Only Tribal Chief and the extended Anoa'i family are the focus of WWE 2K25," said Roman Reigns. "We've been building toward this moment for generations and I challenge players everywhere to show me and my Wiseman, Paul Heyman, what they've got, and prove they're worthy of the attention of their Tribal Chief."</p><p>"WWE 2K25 expands on our winning formula in nearly every aspect of the player experience," said Greg Thomas, president of developer Visual Concepts. "Our new approach to 2K Showcase and MyRISE storylines really tap into the creativity of the development team, and we're excited to see our community enjoy these updated features."</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 is available now to pre-order across three editions: Standard Edition ($69.99), Deadman Edition ($99.99), and The Bloodline Edition ($129.99), with the latter two including new cosmetics and the Season Pass to post-launch DLC character packs, as well as seven day earlier access - that's 7th March ahead of the Standard Edition on 14th March.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark">WWE 2K23 had its online servers shut down</a>, leaving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game currently available with online functionality. It will soon be joined by 2K25 in March in a clear push towards the latest game in the series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Xbox owner Microsoft is currently in discussions to buy social media giant TikTok.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the newly-reinstalled US President Trump, who has now told reporters of Microsoft's involvement (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Reuters</a>). Microsoft itself has declined to comment.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's current status in the US appears precarious, after it was banned by the previous US administration and the US Supreme Court due to national security concerns linked to the app's Chinese owner ByteDance. Here in Europe, the UK government, BBC and the European Commission have banned the app from use on official phones.

<p>
Ahead of returning to office, Trump had signalled he would pause the ban - though TikTok still took itself offline within the US for a brief window, before returning online with a message that thanked Trump personally.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's US ban is now officially paused for 75 days, during which time the social media giant and its compulsive algorithm must either be sold or banned for good. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft is one of a few companies with deep enough pockets to make a serious bid, with various valuations of TikTok ranging around $100bn, and some even higher.
</p>
<p>
Still, as we well know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft seemed happy to shell out $67.8bn just a couple of years ago to snap up Call of Duty and World of Warcraft maker Activision Blizzard</a>. What's $30bn more for control of the hugely-influential TikTok?
</p><p>
Microsoft has been interested in TikTok previously, and got close to a bid in 2020 during Trump's first term in office. Other contenders to buy the social media firm include cloud technology company Oracle, as well as X owner Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>
TikTok would be, by far, Microsoft's biggest acquisition to date. Other than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Microsoft previously paid $26bn for LinkedIn, $19.7bn for speech recognition company Nuance Communications, $8.5bn for Skype, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-usd7-5bn-deal-to-acquire-zenimax-approved-in-the-us-and-eu">$7.5bn for Bethesda owner ZeniMax Media</a>.
</p>
<p>Last week, popular card battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-team-seeking-new-publisher-as-game-returns-online-following-unexpected-us-ban-alongside-tiktok">Marvel Snap returned online with an apology to players</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">it was also made briefly unavailable</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is published by Nuverse, another company owned by TikTok parent ByteDance. Marvel Snap's development team has now said it will seek an alternative publishing partner.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-will-be-around-20-30-hours-long-and-feature-four-difficulty-levels.1093593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-30-hours-long/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero is looking to be much longer than the typical hack and slash games, judging from information revealed during some recent interviews.</p>
<p>As revealed on <a href="https://tieba.baidu.com/p/9446196938?share=9105&amp;fr=sharewise&amp;see_lz=0&amp;share_from=post&amp;sfc=copy&amp;client_type=2&amp;client_version=12.60.1.2&amp;st=1737962073&amp;is_video=false&amp;unique=D7A94B34CF77EF0E45F70BE4B6253665#/">Chinese forums Tieba</a>, it has been revealed in a recent interview that the game in development by S-Game will require between 20 and 30 hours to complete the main story, with 20 hours of additional side content, which should make the game feel more in line with modern action role-playing games that pure action games that are typically much shorter. The game will also feature a total of four difficulty levels ranging from simple to extremely difficult, so the total play time will likely be higher for those who wish to be challenged or want to play through the game multiple times at different difficulty levels. No matter the difficulty, however, players will not have to completely restart boss battles upon defeat, as they will start again at the second phase if they reach it before being defeated.</p>
<p>Speaking about bosses, these recent interviews have also confirmed how Phantom Blade Zero will feature what sounds like a boss-rush mode where it will be possible to fight main campaign bosses again. This mode will also feature some hidden bosses, so it definitely sounds like the game will feature plenty of content. 30 main weapons and more than 20 secondary weapons will be available in the game, so combat should be pretty varied.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat mechanics, I feel S-Game already has them down well, as I really enjoyed the small slice of Phantom Blade Zero I played during<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/"> Gamescom 2024.</a> If traversal, level design, and encounter design are as good as the combat mechanics, the game has the potential to become one of the best action games ever released.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. You can check out the game's latest trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/">here</a>.</p>

But look closer, and it’s clear something just isn’t right. Yes, it’s a game about creating words to fill out a puzzle board. Except those words aren’t actually real — and they all have special powers. Think of it like an alien take on Scrabble. It takes a while to wrap your head around, but <em>Lok</em>’s surreal setup makes for an excellent brain-scratching puzzler.</p><p>There is actually a story of sorts here. <em>Lok</em> takes place in a black-and-white fantasy realm, and your goal is to help little worm-like creatures progress through each level. The stages are grids of squares, and your goal is to turn each one black. (I have no idea how this helps the creatures move, but just stay with me here.) You turn them black by placing letters to spell out words. Completed words will black out squares, and certain words also have the ability to black out even more.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/25/24351112/lok-digital-review-word-game-iphone-android-steam">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzMx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review">Antonblast is an out-of-control platformer with its heart in the ’90s</a></h2><div><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon.

<p>Larian Studios recently informed players that the Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 stress test began on PS5 earlier than intended by accident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, Larian Studio released a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a> confirming that some PS5 users accidentally received early access to Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 before the stress test’s intended date. If you see version 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053 on your main menu, you are also one of the users who received the automatic update. Moreover, the unintentional update on your PS5 doesn’t guarantee access to Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 Stress Test when it officially arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larian <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1883957300123349467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that some regions in Europe and Asia mistakenly received the new patch early “as an update to their live game version in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test.” Players should know that this version of Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 8 is unsupported, and the developers have suggested revert to patch 7. Players will face compatibility issues with save games, mods, and multiplayer if they continue to play Patch 8. If you have already updated Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, here’s how to return to Patch 7.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-return-to-baldur-s-gate-patch-7-after-unintentional-ps5-update">How to Return to Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 After Unintentional PS5 Update</h2>



<p>To know if your PS5 has received the unintentional Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 updates, head to the Main Menu and read your version number. If it is 01.800.000 or 4.1.1.6583053, you have fallen victim to the unintentional update. However, there is a straightforward way to get rid of the issue. Just uninstall the Baldur’s Gate 3 application from your console and then reinstall it to be reverted to patch 7.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Steve Ogg, the actor behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s breakout main character Trevor, has said he wants to return in Rockstar's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> in order to die at the very beginning. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg said he believed the idea would make for a neat moment where he passed the torch to GTA 6's new protagonists - even if it meant getting his head kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"It would be fun if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning. I think that would be cool," Ogg said.

<p>
"Because it also acknowledges the fans... like 'Hey, thank you. Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over'."
</p>
<p>
The moment would mirror an early moment with Trevor in GTA 5, where the character quickly offs GTA 4 character Johnny Kleibitz.
</p>
<p>
Alas, with less than a year until the game's debut, Ogg has said he's not yet been asked to return.
</p>
<p>
In the 12 years since GTA 5's release, Ogg's career has taken off, with roles in The Walking Dead, Westworld and Better Call Saul. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar, meanwhile, has spent the last decade expanding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> with new content, and building the hotly-anticipated GTA 6 - which is currently due to launch (sans Trevor) later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Last week, speculation swirled that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">Rockstar might choose to make GTA 6 cost £80, or $100</a>, ushering in a new industry-wide raise in game prices. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">GTA 6 "parody" game looks set to launch soon on Steam, despite being kicked off the PlayStation Store</a>.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dauntless">Dauntless</a> and Fae Farms developer Phoenix Labs has announced that they are laying off “the majority of the studio”, leaving the future of their two games seriously in doubt.</p>
<p>On a post to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn</a>, the studio writes:</p>


<p>Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.</p>
<p>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.</p>
<p>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</p>

<p>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals – they are some of the best in the business.</p>
<p>The company had previously made significant cuts last year, with layoffs and project cancellations in May 2024 that were estimated to affect around 140 employees.</p>
<p>Our thoughts naturally go out to all of those now affected by these further layoffs, and we hope that, as dire as the games industry is looking right now, they’re able to find fresh work soon.</p>
<p>This latest announcement would suggest that ongoing development for Dauntless and Fae Farm will be seriously affected, and it remains to be seen if and how the company plans to support them going forward.</p>
<p>Dauntless was the studio’s biggest hit getting its full launch in 2019 and able to ride the wave of interest in the Monster Hunter formula. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/25/dauntless-review-2020-switch-ps4-xbox-mobile/">Dauntless review</a>, we said, “Although hardly original in its premise, Dauntless offers an extremely fun and accessible take on the monster-hunting roleplaying game. It wastes no time in throwing you straight into the action and while easy to pick up there’s plenty of depth there for fans of the genre. What’s more Dauntless is completely free to play, gracefully sidestepping those annoying monetisation pitfalls we’re so used to seeing.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-workbenches-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-1-behind-enemy-lines/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s Behind Enemy Lines is Mission 1 and has the first Workbench in the game. The level lacks the depth and complexity of later maps, but it serves as an adequate introductory mission, and you can still miss the first Workbench if you’re not thorough.</p>



<p>Behind Enemy Lines ticks all the right boxes to start a Campaign: Introduces us to Harry Hawker, has tutorials showing us the ropes of the gameplay, and its fairly linear structure prepares us for the more open levels. Plus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> Mission 1 features the Workbench Collectible.</p>



<p>So let’s get the first mission done as easily as possible and get you on the board.</p>



<h2 id="h-behind-enemy-lines-mission-1-workbench-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Behind Enemy Lines Mission 1 Workbench Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>

</figure>



<p><strong>The Behind Enemy Lines Workbench is hidden behind a boarded-up door in Sniper Elite Resistance’s Mission 1.</strong></p>



<p>Using the two screenshots I’ve provided above, you can see how to get to the Workbench. Thankfully, unlike later levels, there’s <strong>only one to find</strong> this time around. However, due to <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a>‘s gameplay and openness, you can easily finish the level and miss it.</p>



<p>From the start of the level, you can only follow one linear path to reach the Workbench area. It requires you to go under the bridge, shoot the Dam, and climb up. Once you get to the top, <strong>the Workbench is in the house in front of you</strong>.</p>



<p>Inside, on the left, you find a boarded-up door. There are three ways to deal with boarded-up doorways in Sniper Elite Resistance: </p>



<ul>
<li>Use a found Crowbar.</li>



<li>Dismantle them using your hands.</li>



<li>Shoot the boards.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each solution depends on the situation. Here, a Crowbar is found next to the door, making this the easiest and quietest solution. </p>



<p>Pull the boards off the door, head inside, and the Workbench is here. Walk up to it and interact with it to register the Collectible, putting the Collectible’s location on the map for any subsequent playthroughs of the mission. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-workbenches-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Workbenches Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<p><strong>Workbenches are used to acquire new weapons and part upgrades and have been featured in Sniper Elite before.</strong></p>



<p>To unlock new Suppressors, recoil-reducing parts, and much more, you need to find Workbenches and use them. It makes the game easier for you and makes the daunting task of completing missions on Authentic Difficulty more palatable—making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance’s Trophies and Achievements list</a> easier as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>This is one of the easier Workbenches to find in Sniper Elite Resistance. Do you plan to find them all? Are you enjoying your Sniper Elite Resistance? Let us know below.</p>

<p>EA could be re-releasing The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 with all their expansions to celebrate its 25 anniversary.</p>



<p>The new claims come courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, who say that a source familiar with EA plans have said that EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on PC.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1883938087446995432
</p></figure>



<p>Its report comes as a flurry of activity has hit the official Sims X (formerly Twitter) account, with the page posting cryptic teases. The latest showed The Sims 2 menu, with the caption “BRB” (be right back).</p>



<p>According to Kotaku, the Celebrate 25 years of The Sims video posted on January 14, which should are “Nostalgia Now” announcement between January 27 to January 31 is the announcement, and release, of The Sims 1 and The Sims 2. So for those excited by the announcement, only have a few days to wait.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064
</p></figure>



<p>Also pointed out by the report is that both games will launch with all of their original expansion packs.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if EA plans to re-release The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 on consoles at a later date.</p>



<p>Regardless, the news will be a warm-welcome to The Sims players, who have been stuck with The Sims 4 for over a decade. While most players are seemingly happy with the games constant updates, a nostalgia trip is almost certainly welcome too. </p>



<p>As of October 2019, The Sims games have generated over $5 billion in revenue and have sold 200 million units across all of its games. In March 2024, it was announced that a Sims film is in development.</p>



<p>Are you excited to replay both games? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>The modder behind Fallout: Nuevo Mexico has cancelled the project to prioritise their mental health and "face reality".</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, Fallout: Nuevo Mexico was intended to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-seen-fallout-london-heres-fallout-nuevo-mexico">rework of Fallout: New Vegas into an all-new game set in Mexico City</a>.</p>
<p>However, a statement from modder Zapshock on the mod's Discord server (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/">TheGamer</a>) confirmed the project has been cancelled. "This project has been my passion, my obsession, and a huge part of my life for years," wrote Zapshock. "I've poured thousands of hours into it, late nights, early mornings, and everything in between."</p>

<p>They continued: "But as much as I love this project, I need to prioritise my mental health and face reality. The team is small (less than four), the workload enormous, and the costs ahead, both financial and personal, are too great. Continuing forward simply isn't sustainable for me and everyone involved, including voice actors."</p>
<p>Zapshock described the decision as "painful" but "necessary" and thanked the community for supporting the project until now.</p>

<p>A trailer for the ambitious project was released last October (above), which revealed the scope of this new wasteland. The ruined Mexico City would have formed a battleground for multiple factions and would include areas like "the decaying colonia of Chapultepec" and "the submerged canals of Xochimilco".</p>
<p>Comparisons were quickly made with Fallout: London, a similarly-sized mod released for free on GOG last year. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>That project, though, wasn't without its problems, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">launching as it did in a shaky condition</a> with performance issues.</p>
<p>Could Bethesda itself ever release a Fallout game outside of America? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-healthy-thanks-to-sneaky-popular-fallout-76-says-todd-howard">Not according to Todd Howard</a>.</p>
<p>"Part of the Fallout schtick is on the Americana naïveté," he said in an interview last year after the success of the Fallout TV show. "For us right now it's ok to acknowledge some of those other areas but our plans are to predominantly keep it in the US."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s Early Access launch has felt a bit like trying to drive British roads over the last couple of years. There’s more potholes than you can shake a stick at, an endless string of road works as water pipes burst and need emergency repairs, as alt nets dig trenches for their own fibre networks, and more. Kunos Simulazioni’s games are lauded as some of the best driving and racing sims out there, but on day one that’s coming with more than a few rough edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, that’s exactly what Early Access is for. It’s there to let developers release early with a subset of content, an acceptance of bugs and issues, and a preview of what’s to come through a roadmap of updates. Even so, Assetto Corsa Evo has stalled at the starting line on some of its key features.</p>


<p>It’s a tale that’s practically as old as online gaming: server issues. Assetto Corsa Evo is planned to be an always online game, tying progression through the career, car unlocks and more to being logged in, much like we see in Gran Turismo 7. While this can be nominally justified to preserve the integrity of a game’s experience when seeing other players, when the servers don’t work (whether that’s launch day overloading or at the inevitable shutdown sometime in the next decade), it locks off major parts of the game. In Assetto Corsa Evo’s case, it meant the first batch of 20 cars was initially locked down to just 5 on day one, until Kunos hurriedly patched the game to make all cars available without the nascent career and driving academy.</p>
<p>Online features are now being separately stress tested through specific beta builds and time windows, working to build it back into the main branch of the game as soon as possible.</p>


<p>That’s far from the only issue at this point, with bugs in setting up racing wheels –&nbsp;though immediately recognised, there’s no obvious preset for my Fanatec CSL Elite and McLaren wheel, and I had to disable other controllers to have it recognised – some complaints over performance with the initial release, a general clunky sluggishness to the menus and making adjustments, and odd choices like listing each car’s livery as though it’s a separate vehicle.</p>
<p>A lot of that can and will be fixed over time, so it’s great to see that the main thing that matters – the physics and handling of the cars – is as accomplished and enjoyable as ever. There’s a good spread of cars included in this initial Early Access launch, from road cars (well, sporty versions of road cars like the Abarth 695 Biposto version of the souped-up Fiat 500) through to a Mercedes GT2. There’s no sign of the GT3 cars that were the star of Assetto Corsa Competizione, so there’s fewer apples-to-apples comparisons to make there.</p>
<p>Cars are generally rather grippy, and you can really get some of the heft that is inherent to the chunkier road cars in the game, like the BMW M4 CSL. At the same time, there’s Brands Hatch and Laguna Seca in the game from the off, both tracks with iconic precipitous drops that give you that stomach-dropping sense of lift as you try to go through them, and you really feel that through both the force feedback and the visuals, the weight of the car moving around through the corner.</p>

<p>The foundations are there, but there’s still plenty of work for Kunos to do for the simulation and the surrounding racing experience. The force feedback can be a bit inconsistent – not least because it sometimes doesn’t want to activate for the wheel – the AI when racing is not the most engaging and a bit dim. The graphics engine also comes off as nice and accomplished, this being a new self-developed engine from Kunos, instead of Unreal Engine as was used in Assetto Corsa Competizione.</p>
<p>There’s a long road ahead for Assetto Corsa EVO, both in terms of Kunos quickly racing to fix up the initial release of the game with online servers, career and events, and the path ahead to the full launch. Some of the biggest draws are some way off into the future, with things like the open world Eifel freeroam region around the Nurburgring, and the essential online multiplayer still to come.</p>
<p>As it stands, then, Assetto Corsa EVO is not yet an essential buy. It’s got a cut price for the Early Access launch, so it’s tempting to grab the game now and dabble with it, but as usual, you’ll also need to accept that it’s a rough draft – and rougher than expected at this point in time. It might not take too long, but there will be a wait for this to start to realise its potential.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> by NVIDIA as one of the games that would be updated with the new features introduced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5090-suprim-soc-32-gb-gpu-review-enter-the-realm-of-ai-charged-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards</a>, which are due to launch in two days. That made perfect sense, given the current support of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and path tracing.</p>
<p>However, we had no timeframe for the addition of those features until the game's developer, MachineGames, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/503940938959160381" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> one a few hours ago. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be updated with those features (alongside some bug fixes) with a patch due in February.</p>
<p><em>We're happy to confirm that Update 3 will release in February and will include support for NVIDIA's latest generation Blackwell GPUs; new graphical features and options; and bug fixes based on feedback you've provided. (Notably, issues that have prevented some players from 100%-ing the game and from climbing vines or squeezing through walls in Sukhothai.)</em></p>
<p>While MachineGames did not mention specific features, they should be NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and the brand new RTX Hair. The former will, of course, provide a further performance boost to an already fairly well-optimized game, and the latter is part of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Kit</a>.</p>
<p>With the new graphics cards, NVIDIA has introduced Linear-Swept Spheres (LSS), a GPU-accelerated primitive that reduces the amount of geometry required to render strands of hair. LSS uses spheres instead of triangles to match hair shapes more accurately. According to NVIDIA, LSS enables ray-traced hair to be rendered with better performance and a smaller memory footprint.</p>
<p>RTX Hair is one half of what NVIDIA is calling the 'RTX Character Rendering SDK,' which will be available later this month. While RTX Hair is set to debut in February with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, there's no news yet on any game implementing the other half, RTX Skin. However, we do know RTX Skin will be available as part of RTX Remix.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has at least one expansion planned, the story DLC titled The Order of Giants. Moreover, it will launch on PlayStation 5 this Spring.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outside-the-blocks">Outside The Blocks</a> is a diorama <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> so beautiful I was initially distrustful of it, as if it was some sort of dazzling carnivorous plant trying to lure me in to munch on my hands. I've had a play of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350220/Outside_the_Blocks/">Steam demo</a> now, and am happy to report that it's still very beautiful, and also that I still have hands: an incredible victory on all counts.</p>

<p>Outside The Blocks touts itself as "the ultimate playground for builders and creators who want to express their artistic side in a relaxing, stress-free environment. Forget about objectives and pressure—immerse yourself in the pure joy of creation". You're free to construct lovely buildings using either granular block-plonking or a tool that lets you manipulate big chunks. Once you've finished with your buildings, you can pop down tufts, streams, pigs, and whatever else you fancy. Or, you could just mess around sculpting foliage for ages, which is what I did.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend the Steam logs, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350220/view/501687870051844705">this one</a> where developer Michał Kubas charts his visit to the small French town of Troyes "renowned for its beautifully preserved timber-framed buildings", all to gather references for modular building blocks. "I gathered 1,750 references of interesting buildings, which I meticulously analyzed and broke down into appropriate modules," writes Kubas. "I can confidently say that the vast majority of them could easily be reconstructed in my game!"</p>
<p>Some features. Terrain features, if you will:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bases &amp; Glass Domes: Frame your masterpiece in style.</li>
<li>Nature Elements &amp; Organic Objects: Add life and vibrancy to your scenes.</li>
<li>Advanced Terrain Editing: Shape the ground to match your imagination.</li>
<li>Epoxy Resin: Easily add water levels for stunning aquatic effects.</li>
<li>Weather Conditions &amp; Lighting Schemes: Set the perfect mood and atmosphere.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I especially love the recreation of epoxy resin techniques - an old modelling trick for creating realistic-looking bodies of water complete with surf I'm familiar with through Warham. This one's TBA for a full release date. And, yep, it includes a photo mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Elder Scrolls, Fallout and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> developer Bethesda has wished veteran voice actor Wes Johnson a speedy recovery, after he was hospitalised last week in a serious condition.
</p>
<p>
Johnson has regularly voiced characters in Bethesda's games for more than 20 years, and appeared in every major project from the studio since 2002's The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927">said</a> Johnson was "not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends".
</p>
<p>
Johnson is currently in intensive care after being found unresponsive in his hotel room last week. The actor had travelled to host an Alzheimer's charity event in Atlanta but failed to attend - at which point the alarm was raised. 
</p>
<p>
The actor's condition was made public via a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/unleash-the-fury-for-the-love-of-wes-johnson">GoFundMe</a> page which has currently raised $140k (£112k), and which it says will go to Johnson's family and help cover medical expenses. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Wes is not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends.</p><p>We wish him well and hope for an easy recovery. <a href="https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji">https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Johnson plays Sheogorath in The Elder Scrolls series, Fawkes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and Ron Hope in Starfield, among dozens of other parts.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Johnson has also made appearances in TV series such as The Wire and Veep, and is the announcer for NHL team Washington Capitals.
</p>
<p>"The Washington Capitals express our heartfelt thoughts and send our best wishes to our beloved public address announcer, Wes Johnson," a statement from the team reads. "We kindly ask everyone to keep Wes in your thoughts and to respect the family's privacy as they navigate this challenging time and focus on Wes' wellbeing."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dauntless">Dauntless</a> have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The studio has been owned by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">secretive blockchain company Forte</a> since some time in 2023. Since that year Phoenix Labs have seen three other rounds of layoffs. The studio saw 140 job cuts in May last year, while 34 jobs were axed back in December 2023. Before that, the company cut loose 9 percent of their workers in May 2023.</p>
<p>Over the same period there has been growing player dissatisfaction with Dauntless, which was generally well received when it first arrived. Edwin called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-preview">"Monster Hunter for people who fear grind"</a>. But recent player reviews complain that free-to-play business tactics have been increasingly interfering with basic design of the game. The game has been on PC and other platforms since 2019 but its arrival to Valve's shopfront in December last year came with a big update called "Awakening".</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of changes, this update included the bizarre decision to essentially wipe every player's character progression and weapon collections to zero. As you might expect, the game quickly attained an "overwhelmingly negative" review average on the store. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, this update was criticised by the studio's former associate producer, Jessie Leigh Gagnon, who said it was no longer "free to slay" in complaints spotted by <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/329756/former-dauntless-associate-producer-criticizes-awakening-update-for-gutting-core-mechanics">TechPowerUp</a>.</p>
<p>"They’ve gutted the core gameplay and crafting mechanics," she said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271577078045540352/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. "The essence of the Slayers (who I named just over ten years ago), has been, in fact, slayed to ribbons. We never would have made decisions that are so blatantly not player focused."   </p><p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/603016424736163000">soon apologised for the way the update was handled</a>, and recognised player distaste for the progress wipe and other changes. They handed out in-game currency and XP as part of this apology, saying that they would work to make things better. "We recognize the need to rebuild trust and improve how we engage with our community," they said. It's hard to see how this might now happen - it's possible even the person who wrote these words is now unemployed.</p>
<p>"We will share more details in the coming weeks," say Phoenix Labs about the future of Dauntless (and the studio's other game, Stardew-like farming simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>). But whatever they say it will be hard to take at face value, given that previous statements insisted the studio's games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-and-fae-farm-devs-lay-off-34-people-but-insist-dlc-plans-and-unannounced-games-unaffected">would be "unaffected" by the periodic layoffs</a>. 

</p><p>On top of these concerns, we also have to remember that behind Phoenix Labs there stands an inscrutable blockchain company in the shadows, smoking the world's forests and typing decisions nobody can see into an iPhone. When Forte bought the studio, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">reportedly instructed management</a> at Phoenix Labs not to tell anybody that the blockchain group were the new owners. Which is, uh, I believe the business term is:  fucked up. </p>
<p>Forte's only other game studio during that time were the mobile game developers Rumble Games. They were shut down by the blockchain company in July last year. </p>

<p>The creative director of Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead Games has announced that he is taking a sabbatical before starting work on the studio’s next game.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s CCO, Johan Pilestedt, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to announce that he is taking some time off. Pilestedt explained that while players started enjoying Helldivers 2 last year, he has worked on the game since 2016 and the Helldivers franchise since 2013. As he worked for 11 years “around the clock” on the same IP, Pilestedt had to sacrifice time with his family, friends, wife, and himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the Helldivers 2 CCO will take some time off to “redeem what was lost” from those who have been supporting him for more than 10 years. Pilestedt has ensured the community that all the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios will be hard at work to deliver amazing Helldivers 2 content to the players while he’s on sabbatical. And once he returns, work “on the next Arrowhead Game” will begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt has also posted an <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884016859676303815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> since beginning his sabbatical, revealing that the first thing he did was start “a game jam with the most senior devs/founders” at Arrowhead Game Studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Helldivers 2 CEO wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-listers to be violently killed</a> in the upcoming movie, as the director talks about Arrowhead’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement with the adaptation</a>.

            <p>It looks like Level 5's forthcoming Fantasy Life RPG is headed to PlayStation as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is set for release on Switch in April this year, following multiple delays.</p>
<p>The series has not been released on PlayStation before but, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:f6jharuhwg5szxe22rfijybf/post/3lgq2tvakj22s">Gematsu</a> spotted, a PlayStation Store page was accidentally published last night and then taken down.</p>

		<p>People Can Fly has revealed that they are a co-development partner for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, working alongside series leads The Coalition on the prequel third person shooter.</p>
<p>The Polish studio has historic ties to the franchise, having been a co-development partner to Epic Games through the original Gears of War trilogy, before then becoming lead developer on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review-xbox-360/">Gears of War: Judgment</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12m0bw1W_tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Gears of War: E-Day will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars.</p>
<p>CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said, “Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.”</p>

<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF added, “Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.”</p>
<p>This announcement will be a boost for the studio, which has had a difficult time of late. In December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">they laid off 120 employees</a> from a headcount of around 700, reduced their self-publishing strategy and scaled back on several projects. As a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, being able to announce a steady gig like Gears of War: E-Day will no doubt be a boost to their profile – there was a healthy bump yesterday, though<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PCF:WSE?window=MAX"> the stock’s trend has been downward since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>That said, their partnership with Microsoft was already known, having <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/310133/people-can-fly-selected-to-make-project-maverick-for-microsoft">confirmed work on a game codenamed Project Maverick back in 2023</a>. This was already expected to be a Gears of War project, given those historic ties, but has now been made clear.</p>
<p>The one thing that <em>isn’t</em> clear is what this means for a Gears of War: E-Day release window. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024</a>, but has no release date announced and was absent from the Developer_Direct stream last week.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> community was briefly awash with rumours than publisher NetEase were playing 4D chess with their hero-loving hearts last week, according to a new report by Michael Cripe for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">Ian Games</a> The rumours began in a Discord for the team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> named Marvel Rivals Leaks, where user Keone speculated that NetEase were seeding fake information on upcoming heroes for dataminers to find.</p>

<p>"It has come to our attention that the devs have set up fake characters to catch leakers," wrote Keone in the Discord. "Not only the ones in the code - but potentially inside sources too". They then gave a list of previously rumoured heroes they now believed were "very likely fake", including Quicksilver, Professor X, and Paste Pot Pete, who I hadn't heard of until now and suddenly I have a renewed interested in Marvel.</p>
<p>The Discord, says the report, had previously found some success catching heroes before their official announcement, such as the Fantastic Four. The rumour gained some traction before reaching datamining group X0XLeak, who weren't so convinced. "Could they be intended troll by NetEase? I guess,” an X0XLeak spokesninja told IGN. "Would it make sense, in my opinion? No. The way I see it, they could have made it way easier if their goal was to troll us.” They also posted <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227">an X thread</a> as evidence that the rumoured-then-unrumoured heroes existed in the game's code, thoroughly re-rumouring them once again. From IGN's report:</p>
<blockquote><p>X0X’s matfacio told IGN that, if NetEase had truly tucked away bait to trick leakers in this way, it would need to know exactly how dataminers are rummaging through the Marvel Rivals backend, explaining: “I think it would require reverse engineering a reverse engineer.”</p>
<p>The existence of new, hidden hero names in Marvel Rivals doesn’t totally poor cold water on the idea that the developers are attempting to mislead, but some believe the studio would have to go through a lot of trouble — likely more trouble than it’s worth — just to keep the more dedicated fans on their toes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That "trouble" includes things like datamined voice line events and gameplay tags, which some community members reckoned represented <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1882535375387697271">far too much work</a> to be part of an elaborate hoax. Keone did end up amending their initial stance, saying that their post spread beyond their control before they could make edits.</p><p>"The primary assumption from the main leakers (separate from me, the ones who have most info) now is that the ‘plants’ are in fact still real. And the developers did not intend for us to find them," Keone says. "That's why I edited the original post and since deleted it, and have worked to help clear up confusion surrounding it."</p>
<p>Please do have a read of the report in full for all the details and context. I don't play Marvel Rivals myself, but I found this one interesting since - while it's somewhat of a well-seasoned nothing burger - it's fundamentally just a group of passionate players wanting to share the excitement of getting new toys to play with. Hell, <em>I'm </em>excited about Paste Pot Pete and I haven't watched a Marvel film since X-Men 2, nor played a videogame in 15 years.</p>
<p>"A server that started small to spread information has now become a cornerstone of information across the entire community, and sometimes we can misinterpret things or make mistakes," Keone told IGN. "We're a group of people working hard to find and share information, and there's never malice behind what we post. We'll work hard to make sure things don't spread like wildfire again unless it's been verified first, and are grateful for everything we've been able to share thus far."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Many secrets lurk throughout Sniper Elite Resistance, including Propaganda Posters to track down. Although optional, they serve a great benefit if you find each one in Resistance, and I’ve pinpointed the location of each Poster in the main Campaign.</p>



<p>The sheer scale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s levels means there’s a lot to do. On top of main objectives and optional side tasks, you can do specific actions related to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophies and Achievements</a> list and also track down the countless Collectibles most levels contain.</p>



<p>One of the most important though—other than Workbenches—are Propaganda Posters. This guide has the location of each Propaganda Poster, where to find them, and what they do in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-propaganda-posters-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Propaganda Posters Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fresh gameplay awaits. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Obtaining Propaganda Posters unlocks special Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You can see different gameplay options on <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main menu. You’ve got the Campaign, Invasion, and Multiplayer, and it also mentions Propaganda Challenges. When you start Resistance, the Propaganda Challenge sub-menu looks uninviting and unreceptive.</p>



<p>This is because all seven challenges are locked from the get-go. <strong>You must find a Poster hidden in seven of the nine levels</strong> in the entire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance Mission List</a>. Each one unlocks a brand-new challenge, but they can be serious time sappers to locate. This is where I step in to save your day.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-propaganda-poster-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Every Propaganda Poster Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<p><strong>I’ve provided my location on each mission’s map below, and this is where the Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Poster is.</strong></p>



<p>Each Poster has a <strong>distinct gloss and shine</strong> which makes it obvious it’s the Collectible. Posters are scattered throughout the levels, but only a specific one is needed. If you want to skip the text, head to my player marker on the map screenshot to quickly and easily find the Posters.</p>



<h3 id="h-dead-drop-propaganda-poster-location">Dead Drop Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Dead Drop Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Start the level, carry on forward, follow the natural path to the castle, and get to the broken stone bridge. Take the wooden bridge to the left of it that takes you to the river, and <strong>break the planks covering the underground doorway</strong>. Head inside, move ahead, and lockpick the door ahead. Climb the ladder, lock pick the door directly in front of you once you get to the top, and the Poster is on the right on some stairs.</p>



<h3 id="h-sonderzuge-sabotage-propaganda-poster-location">Sonderzüge Sabotage Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Sonderzüge Sabotage Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The Poster is on the building right next to the “<strong>Find the missing Resistance Cell” Optional Objective</strong>. Simply, head to this location, and go to my marker on the Map Location screenshot above. You can’t miss the Propaganda Poster.</p>



<h3 id="h-collision-course-propaganda-poster-location">Collision Course Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Collision Course Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make your way through Collision Course until you reach the train tracks—you can’t miss them. I’m giving you the fastest route to the Poster, <strong>but it is a dangerous one</strong>. If you follow the tracks across the bridge, you <strong>unfortunately come face-on with a tank</strong>. Either take it out or run past it. Follow the tracks around the curved track, and the Poster is on a tunnel’s wall on the right-hand side.</p>



<h3 id="h-devil-s-cauldron-propaganda-poster-location">Devil’s Cauldron Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Devil’s Cauldron Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Another simple Poster to find in Devil’s Cauldron. Go to my map marker indicated above. It’s a relatively easy path to get there, and the Propaganda Poster is on the <strong>side of a church with a big watch tower at the top</strong>—fixed with a zip line.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault-on-fort-rouge-propaganda-poster-location">Assault On Fort Rouge Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Assault On Fort Rouge Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is probably the furthest Poster when it comes to travel distance from the start point. Cross the starting bridge, turn left, and go to the area I’ve highlighted. The Assault On Fort Rouge Poster is tucked away in alleys deep in the bottom-left corner of the level.</p>



<h3 id="h-lock-stock-and-barrels-propaganda-poster-location">Lock, Stock And Barrels Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Lock, Stock And Barrels Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>When Harry spawns, go forward, and immediately take the left path taking you <strong>down a hill and toward a wooden bridge crossing water</strong>. You can either go left or right, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong>, as either one has Germans to get past. I went right, demonstrated my expert-killing skills (raising the alarm in the process), and went through an open wooden gate to the house the Poster is on. Use my reference point, as the <strong>Poster is hidden behind a decent amount of foliage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-end-of-the-line-propaganda-poster-location">End Of The Line Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>End of the Line Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This Poster gave the most trouble of all, despite the fact all Posters are found near the beginning of the level. I searched everywhere, but it was <strong>sneakily hidden at the top of a ladder!</strong> From the default starting location, head down the ladder on the left taking you to the East side of the level. You should be in the train yard now, and there’s a big, open hangar. Either climb the ladder on the side of the building, or head inside and go up a flight of stairs, and head to the platform that takes you outside. The seventh and final Poster is on the side of the wall.  </p>



<hr>



<p>You should now have all seven Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Posters and access to every Propaganda Challenge. Good luck trying to get Gold on every mini-mission, it’s not easy! Let me know how you get on and if you’re chasing all Collectibles.</p>



<p>Plan your time with Sniper Elite Resistance carefully as I’ve also whipped up a handy explainer on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is, and the game’s length</a>.</p>
