<p>A shell of an upgrade</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Super Evil Megacorp has today announced that it will be launching an all-new Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for the TMNT roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate</a>.</p>
<p>The new version launches on <strong>16th December</strong>, either as a standalone purchase or as a paid upgrade pack ($2.49, or your regional equivalent) for those who already own the base game, and it packs in everything you'd expect from a Switch 2 update.</p>
<p>The above trailer promises enhanced visuals and frame rate for smooth 4K 60fps play (resolution dropping to 1080p in handheld), and support for local GameShare and GameChat.</p>
<p>It appears that's <em>all</em> that's included in the Switch 2 upgrade at the time of writing — the trailer mentions both the Metalhead and Casey Jones DLC, though it is unclear whether they are included in the new package. We have reached out to Super Evil Megacorp, and will update this post when we hear back.</p>
<p>The performance boost will be a welcome addition. We had a good time with Splintered Fate when it launched on Switch 1 last year, though we noticed plenty of frame drops and experienced a few hard crashes. The game has seen several updates in the time since then, so perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will be the perfect opportunity to dive back in.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>The news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix is trying to buy Warner Bros.</a> didn’t ever look like it would be <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918">good for game players</a>, but a recent investor call by the streamer suggests things are a whole lot worse than we previously imagined. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters told investors that when it came to Warner’s gaming division, it didn’t even factor it into the $83 billion dollar deal. It was apparently considered to add nothing to the company’s overall value, because “they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p> <p>Warner Bros. Games hasn’t exactly shone of late, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">multiple closures</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">extremely talented teams</a>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-season-5-aquaman-offline-update-refund-1851752453">recent flops of <em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em>, but it’s still hardly minor. For one, <em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game of 2023 in the U.S., more popular that <em>Call of Duty</em>, selling 34 million copies in its first year. That’s&nbsp;<em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue.&nbsp;Then you’ve got the <em>Arkham</em> franchise, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, plus the infinite money machine that is every single&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> game from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> to&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> to&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>. Yes, it’s suffered as much as every other arm of the company under David Zaslav, but it’s not something you’d immediately write off as worthless. However, that’s the price Netflix put on Warner Bros. Games when bidding for the whole company.</p>

 <p>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space,” said Gregory Peters on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">December 8 call</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/"><em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>), “we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p>

 <h2>Netflix already failed hard with games</h2> <p>It’s important to put this perspective into context. Netflix has spent <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122"><em>years</em> trying to work out how to make money through video games</a>, and only <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">failed</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">failed again</a>, stripping back expensive forays into the worlds of PC and console gaming and now sticking exclusively to mobile games with a casual emphasis. That makes sense: Netflix is a TV and movie streaming service, and it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">with hubris that it launched its video gaming ambitions</a> into a market that Google had just so spectacularly crashed out of. Big companies look at the sorts of numbers publishers make from a <em>Call of Duty</em> or&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> and think, “We’d like some of that please,” and assume it just happens. It doesn’t, millions gets wasted, and people lose jobs.</p>

 <p>It’s in the aftermath of this that Netflix is attempting its purchase of Warner Bros., so on some level you can understand why a company so disillusioned with gaming might be so <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> with this aspect of the prize. However, it also speaks of some quite spectacular shortsightedness, given the lucrative nature of so many of WBG’s licenses.</p>

 <p>This all suggests bad times are ahead for those surviving developers under Warner’s roof. Peters further comments initially suggest there might be some internal insight, as he says, “Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>Hogwarts</em> is a great example of that<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.” However, “what we’re offering” is the key phrase, given how clear Netflix has recently made its focus on mobile only. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there,” adds Peters, “so we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p> <p>It certainly makes sense to see the IPs Netflix is getting in the deal as opportunities when it comes to its casual gaming development. The&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games are already mobile-friendly and have a broad family audience, while licenses like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Batman</em> can be milked in an endless stream of mediocre cellphone games. But hopes for further entries in Rocksteady’s <em>Arkham</em> franchise seem unlikely to be met, let alone the new owners reviving what Warner Bros. once did best, with game series like <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>FEAR</em>, and other cruelly abandoned Monolith properties.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rogue is the next character set to arrive in Marvel Rivals on December 12 with Season 5.5, and the developers have provided the usual glimpse of her vanguard moves in a new trailer. </p>







<p>Anna Marie, or more commonly known as Rogue, is perhaps one of the most beloved members of the X-Men in the Marvel fandom. Partnered with her <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-gambit-voice-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved Gambit</a>, fans have been wanting to see her inclusion for a long time, and to see her as a vanguard is just the cherry on top. </p>



<h2 id="h-rogue-heading-to-marvel-rivals">Rogue Heading To Marvel Rivals </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rogue: Tempted to Touch | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_CwYQQP21Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At first glance, Rogue looks poised to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-november-20-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake up the meta</a> in a completely unique way. She’s built primarily as a close-quarters brawler, diving into the thick of the fight and dealing impressive damage up close. But she’s far from limited to melee—she can yank enemies toward her and chip away at anyone caught within her damaging aura.</p>



<p>The real show-stealer, though, is her ability to borrow powers from other heroes. Whoever she drains, she can temporarily wield their abilities as if they were her own. The trailer highlights just how versatile this can be: Psylocke’s invisibility, Thor’s lightning strikes—it all becomes part of Rogue’s toolkit, giving her the potential to dominate the battlefield like no other Vanguard.</p>







<p>Her Ultimate amplifies things even further, letting her batter nearby foes while shielding herself and unleashing heavy, punishing blows. A new Vanguard is always an exciting addition to Marvel Rivals, but Rogue looks ready to steal the spotlight in every sense.</p>



<p>It’s always been the season of Rogue and Gambit, and the notorious couple are finally paired together in-game. What do you think of Rogue’s vanguard abilities in Marvel Rivals?

Players on Switch 2 get experience enhanced resolution, improved load times, performance optimisation, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and more versus the OG Switch version, taking advantage of the more powerful hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, this edition offers exclusive Nintendo content from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, including the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Champion’s Tunic. You’ll also get hundreds of unique Creations Club items, with quests, weapons, armor, spells, dungeons, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is selling Skyrim for Switch 2 standalone for $59.99, but there’s a free upgrade for Skyrim Anniversary Edition owners on Switch. Owners of the Skyrim (base edition) on Switch can buy the Anniversary Upgrade for $19.99 to play on Switch and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim’s release on Switch 2 is sure to resurface all those jokes about Bethesda milking the life out of the game by releasing it on all the platforms under the sun. Skyrim has been ported and remastered so many times that it’s become one of the internet’s most enduring memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course busy working on The Elder Scrolls 6, although development chief Todd Howard has indicated it is still some time away. In a recent interview, he teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">Bethesda could shadowdrop The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, as it did with this year’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and now Skyrim on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support. It also sports improved load times and performance in addition to features found in the original Switch version of Skyrim, like Legend of Zelda Amiibo support, Zelda-themed items, and motion controls.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim truly is the gift that keeps giving for Bethesda, as it's still one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>.

Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>

            <p>The team at MachineGames has issued a new update for <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Along with bug fixes such as sorting incorrect manual entries and the correcting the VO balance on some scenes to make the speech more audible, this update has also added a new outfit for Indy.</p>
<p>This one is the Pankot Palace outfit, so yes, the outfit Indy wore in Temple of Doom when he was served chilled monkey brains. That scene still makes me shiver. The outfit pops Indiana Jones into his round spectacles and bowtie. You can see how it looks in-game via the image further below.</p>
<p>As well as today's new outfit, MachineGames has also promised another new outfit still to come down the line. I wonder which one they will choose?</p>

<li>There's still another new outfit to come in a future update… so stay tuned</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug fixes and game updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Main Game</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-update-now-live/</link>
            <guid>1377397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The final major update for Battlefield 6 - Season 1 has arrived with Winter Offensive, the third update that we knew little <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">about when we first previewed Season 1 back in October</a>. This update adds a new refresh of the Empire State map, turning New York into a frozen, snow-filled battlefield. It adds a new Ice Pick melee weapon, new limited-time game modes, and a whole host of tweaks and changes to the game.</p>



<p>The new limited-time Ice Lock version of the Empire State map is one of the highlights in the Winter Offensive update, as are the new limited-time multiplayer and gauntlet modes that pull players through variations of the Ice Lock Empire State map and introduce a new Freeze mechanic limited to the event.</p>



<p>There's also, of course, a new battle pass for players to work through, which is where you'll be able to unlock the Ice Pick melee weapon introduced with this update.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding changes to the game, update 1.1.3.0 includes improvements to hit registration "<em>across all situations that previously felt unreliable</em>," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0">a blog post on the official Battlefield website</a>. There's also enhanced close-range soldier visibility by way of stronger character highlights, refined weapon handling to help players be accurate with their shots more consistently, and improved reliability for some of the most-used gadgets in the game.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have also made a point to improve the game's audio across the board, update the layouts for Rush and Breakthrough maps, and strengthen vehicle clarity. </p>



<p>It's a fairly sizable update and a solid way to end off Season 1, since this is the final major piece of what we knew was coming in Season 1. So far, Battlefield 6 has been the shooter-of-the-year in 2025, taking the thunder that would have otherwise been held by Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll see how well EA and Battlefield Studios can carry its momentum into the new year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has been spotted for something called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, which appears to pretty much confirm the long-mooted remake or remaster of the piratical open-world adventure.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a>, which puts the game at 18 for "violence", "bad language", and "in-game purchases" (because of course; this is Ubisoft we're talking about, after all) was spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pegi-rates-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>, but it's not the first we've heard of a potential <em>Black Flag </em>remake or remaster.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p72wmu/assassins_creed_black_flag_remake_resynced_leak/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">thequaliti</a> spotted text pointing to <em>Black Flag Resynced </em>within the localization table of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. Essentially, the text is a quick disclaimer discussing "creative liberties" taken with history to create the game, but it's another pretty strong piece of evidence, too.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>is probably getting a remake soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's precedent for this, too; in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June last year</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot promised that "some remakes" of titles in the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>series were on the way, and that these projects would "revisit some of the games [Ubisoft has] created in the past and modernize them".</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag </em>seems like a pretty solid candidate to kick off Ubisoft's slate of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>remakes, especially given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="85cef5b0-2392-4049-9109-bfdd7b8e3e95" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">grim fate</a> of the studio's other foray into nautical adventuring in recent years.</p><p>Still, I'd argue that remaking the original game, or perhaps <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, would be a better shout. These are games with (in my eyes, at least) very clear flaws, so giving them another try and sanding down some of the more troublesome edges makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p><em>Black Flag</em>, by contrast, is still a very good game by today's standards, and as an avowed RPG-element-<em>Assassin's Creed </em>hater, I'm worried Ubisoft is going to drown the seafaring, swashbuckling classic in gear scores and incremental loot.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Given the increasing buzz around the so-called <em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Resynced</em>, it may well be that we can expect an official announcement at The Game Awards, which is set to reward some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2025-nominees" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a925a006-6874-4d20-831b-d86ee39af97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its nominees</a> with shiny trophies later this week.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether that announcement surfaces or not.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Unfortunately, I swear it’s not my fault but yes, today is Tuesday, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864">the worst day of the week</a>. But hey, at least we are here together to enjoy another installment of <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint, a daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have data on how well <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC is selling, a weird <em>Stranger Things</em> crossover, and a report of a new 2K studio with connections to that canceled<em> Perfect Dark</em> game.</p> <h2><strong>Bosses Behind Canned<em> Perfect Dark</em> Reboot Reportedly Creating New 2K Studio</strong></h2> <p>First announced in 2020 and then officially revealed in <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">2024 with a snazzy gameplay trailer</a>, Xbox’s <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot had a lot of buzz around it before <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">it was canned by Microsoft in July</a>. The studio behind the game, The Initiative, was also shut down. And now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400">following a reported attempt at Take-Two to save</a> <em>Perfect Dark,</em> the publisher behind <em>GTA</em> and<em> NBA 2K</em> has apparently hired two of the bosses behind the canceled reboot and is funding the creation of a new game studio.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk Trading Card Game (TCG) has been officially announced, featuring characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and Edgerunners. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red has been hard at work developing the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, even revealing its plans to expand the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development foundation by 2027</a>.

<p>In Cyberpunk TCG, players will be tasked with putting together their ultimate edgerunner team by collecting characters from the franchise and putting them up against their friends. Players will receive “stunning custom artwork” with characters from both the base game, Cyberpunk 2077, and the anime adaptation, Edgerunners. The official announcement on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1998407444121243803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) also arrived with a new trailer, showcasing the type of cards players should expect. </p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's long-rumoured Black Flag remake is seemingly even closer to reality after a listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) ratings board website.
</p>
<p>
Rumours of a Black Flag remake first surfaced back in 2023, when it was reported a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">new version of the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was in development at Ubisoft Singapore</a>, which was still embroiled in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>' protracted development at the time. The report claimed the remake was "in its earliest stages" and "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Four years later, the project still hasn't been officially announced (with Ubisoft perhaps keen to avoid a premature reveal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">another Sands of Time-style embarrassment</a>), but that hasn't stopped the evidence of its existence from piling up. Earlier this year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted at the remake's seemingly imminent arrival, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced has <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1998398019352326187#m">appeared</a> (albeit seemingly briefly) on the PEGI website, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. So is Resynced the long-rumoured Black Flag remake? Obviously, nothing is certain until it's official, but at this point - and with that name - it's harder to believe it isn't. And given Ubisoft recently confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">still had an "unannounced title" to launch before 31st March</a> next year, it's probably out very soon.
</p><p>
Which just leaves the small matter of an official announcement, and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s The Game Awards primed and ready to launch its annual assault of announcements, adverts, and Kojimas upon us this week, I know where I'll be pointing my eyes for likely Black Flag remake reveals.

<p>We're just a couple of days out from The Game Awards this week, so it seems highly likely that Ubisoft is planning to officially reveal the game during the upcoming event.</p>
<p>It's not the only thing that leaked from Geoff Keighley's awards bonanza, since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">Sony accidentally revealed</a> the existence of an unannounced character in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> before the game's planned appearance later this week.</p>
<p>Black Flag originally launches in 2013 and saw releases on both the Wii U and the Switch. It's frequently cited as one of the most popular entries in the series alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_ezio_collection">Assassin's Creed II</a>, largely thanks to its excellent navel combat and more lighthearted narrative.</p>

			<p>The legal battle between Unknown Worlds co-founders Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire and Krafton over the development of Subnautica 2 has been one of the biggest surprise stories of the year for 2025. It's had several twists and turns, the most recent of which being <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">accusations of racist comments made by Cleveland towards Korea</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">Krafton's chief executive officer asking ChatGPT if there was a way to avoid paying</a> Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">the $250 million bonus</a> that is at the heart of this battle.</p>



<p>If you've not been following along, there is a bullet-point list at the bottom of this article taking you through all of our coverage of the story so far. Today's latest update comes after recent testimony given by Unknown Worlds co-founders Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire during a trial from November 17-19, 2025, in the Delaware Court of Chancery. </p>



<p>These testimonies given by the co-founders and the evidence displayed at the trial, in Krafton's view, prove a couple of key things. Firstly, the evidence and testimony make it "<em>unequivocally clear there was no preconceived plan by Krafton to remove Unknown Worlds' leadership to avoid the earnout obligation</em>," as has been previously alleged by the co-founders. </p>



<p>Secondly, Krafton states that the testimony and evidence prove that the co-founders "<em>lied and tried to hide their abandonment [of Subnautica 2 and their duties] because they wanted KRAFTON to pay them hundreds of millions of dollars for nothing</em>."</p>



<p>According to Krafton's timeline of events, Cleveland and McGuire were hiding the fact that both of them were checked out from their work at Unknown Worlds on Subnautica 2 until Krafton found out on May 20, 2025, and prior to that date, Gill and other members of Unknown Worlds were being forced into awkward positions where they had to avoid telling Krafton the truth about Unknown Worlds' leadership situation in order to protect the earnout.</p>



<p>Krafton shared excerpts with Wccftech from the evidence and testimony presented, including statements attributed to Cleveland like "<em>I stopped working four months ago and have entered semi-retirement</em>," which Cleveland made on January 8, 2024, in a private message. Cleveland previously admitted that he no longer wanted to work at Unknown Worlds and that he was burned out, though during this trial process he has come back to say he is 'fired up now' and wants to return to work.</p>



<p>A statement shared that was attributed to McGuire emailing the core Unknown Worlds team regarding his title as technical director on January 10, 2024, reads, "<em>I've continued to do bits and pieces of the job as needed, but I stopped using that title years ago when I felt it no longer reflected my primary contribution to the company</em>."</p>



<p>Another statement attributed to McGuire in his personal log on April 29, 2024, reads, "<em>At home, I met with Charlie and Ted to let them know I'm quitting</em>," followed by a statement from Cleveland on the same day where Cleveland expresses sadness at McGuire leaving, and saying that he is "<em>pretty sure [he'll] be doing the same thing</em>."</p>



<p>A statement attributed to Subnautica 2 lead designer Anthony Gallegos seems to describe the frustrations felt by the rest of the Unknown Worlds team, with Gallegos claiming he "<em>can't even get Max [McGuire] to look at some code for [Subnautica 2] water to help us, but he'll make money off a sale from four years ago and get paid to do nothing</em>."</p>



<p>All of that feels pretty damning against Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, and their testimonies don't make their situation look any better. Per testimony from Cleveland, an email sent to Unknown Worlds staff titled "<em>Updates to Our Leadership Team's Roles and Responsibilities</em>" on August 5, 2024, excluded employees from Krafton. Cleveland did not confirm that Gill intentionally excluded Krafton staff, only that no one from Krafton was listed in the email.</p>



<p>Cleveland also admitted in his testimony that he did not directly tell Krafton CEO, Changham Kim, about his disengagement from work at Unknown Worlds. When Krafton's representation put to Cleveland, "<em>You stood to gain potentially tens of millions of dollars more in earnout, and you couldn't send him [Changham Kim] an email because your arms were hurting? Is that your testimony?"</em> Cleveland responded, "<em>That's not a great reason, I admit</em>."</p>



<p>Cleveland also admitted that Changham Kim "<em>seemed alarmed</em>" when he told Kim that he was "<em>no longer involved in Subnautica at all</em>," and could not provide Kim with an update on the state of the game's development.</p>



<p>A further statement from Gill, taken from an audio transcription of a June 10, 2025, call, reads, "<em>If you [Krafton] want to delay the game, just pay it. Just pay the earnout...agree to pay it now, we can sign something tomorrow...it'll be paid, and we'll give you flexibility on paying it. You can pay it over two years, instead of all at once. But just pay it</em>."</p>



<p>With all of the evidence presented last month at the Delaware Court of Chancery and testimonies from the co-founders, Krafton holds firm in its claim that the co-founders<em> "were always concerned first and foremost about the earnout</em>."</p>



<p>We'll continue to update you on this story as it progresses, though this latest batch of evidence seems to be a huge blow to the co-founders' chances of winning the case.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>



<li>On November 18, the co-founders and their legal team allege that Krafton's plan to avoid paying the $250 million earnout <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">was codenamed "<em>Project X</em>" internally within Krafton, and Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, asked ChatGPT</a> how to avoid paying Unknown Worlds the $250 million bonus.</li>



<li>On November 20, Krafton claimed that co-founder <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">Charlie Cleveland made racist comments regarding Korea in his preparation notes for the litigation</a> between Cleveland, his fellow co-founders, and Krafton, and that Cleveland said, "<em>history will remember that Krafton was bad</em>."</li>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, Better Than Us casts you as a master thief whose goal is to infiltrate the swanky parties of the year 2200's richest bastards and manipulate them into looking the other way as you swipe some of their stuff. There's some stealthing, but as you might expect of a game that lists The Count of Monte Cristo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, and the works of Terry Pratchett as prominently among its inspirations as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, your words will be your most formidable weapon.</p>
<p>Lying is key, but you've got to do it properly. "Tell different stories to different people," the game's blurb reads. "Remember who you told what. Build a web of deception so intricate that even the powerful can't see through it. But slip up once—contradict yourself, forget a detail—and everything unravels."</p><p>For all its setting in futuristic floating cities built to save their wealthy inhabitants from the climate change-ravaged Earth below, Little Bat Games make clear that this isn't a cartoonish flight of fancy. Better Than Us' Steam description reveals that it's been "developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida". The game "deals heavily with issues of extreme wealth inequality and faith. It explores philosophical underpinnings of class oppression, effects of climate change on underprivileged populations, and refugees. It also addresses sexual and gender issues, artificial intelligence, and faith in historical contexts".</p>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues," Little Bat creative director and voice actor Cyrus Nemati says of the studio's approach. "Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios." He and fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> alum Sarah Grayson - the pair voiced Ares and Selene respectively - lead Better Than Us' cast.</p>
<p>As someone who loves a good bit of stealth and weaving wordly webs in the likes of Pentiment, if Little Bat can strike that balance in entertaining fashion while offering plenty of freedom in the way you go about prying the possessions from a set of faithfully-rendered fat cats, I can see myself having a ball with this one.</p>
<p>For now, Better Than Us has a 2026 release window and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3954390/Better_Than_Us/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.
