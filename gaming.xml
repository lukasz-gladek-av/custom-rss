<p>Free Counter-Strike 2 cases are hard to come by, and even if you do get your hands on one, it won’t open for free. Counter-Strike cases, the keys that open them, and the items inside have formed the foundation of a trading market now worth millions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to get CS2 cases for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get free Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Players can get one free Counter-Strike 2 case from the in-game weekly care package. Every week, once a player reaches their next XP rank, they can select two of four available rewards. A case is always included in this group of rewards.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The weekly care package resets every Tuesday at 8pm CT. The weekly care package window can be found in the store, but it will pop up automatically after a player levels up their XP rank. Players can level up their XP rank by playing games using official matchmaking. More XP is earned by playing full-length matches in competitive or Premier mode.</p>



<p>Aside from this method, players can also sometimes get free cases from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2 skin gambling</a> websites. In almost all cases, players have to sign up and use the site in order to get the free cases. Cases on these sites are typically site-specific, and don’t have the same odds and items as the official cases bought and sold through Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-cheap-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get cheap Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Getting only one case per week for free is a very slow method for acquiring cases. Thankfully, players with money in their Steam account can purchase cases for just a few cents.</p>



<p>On the Steam community market, players can go to the CS2 section and filter by the “Container” item type. There they can sort by price and find cases that sell for less than $0.50 like the Recoil Case, the Snakebite Case, and the Fracture Case. Players can even put in a “request to buy” at a specific price that will automatically purchase a case when it reaches a low enough price point.</p>



<p>Which case did you get in your last weekly care package? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/wolfenstein-new-order-colossus-machinegames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Despite my respect for the developers</a> and my own fondness for the character, when I saw the first trailer for <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> last year I was worried!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e17p2IVDUU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> It featured a lot of movement and a lot of combat</a>, and I thought (while simultaneously recalling the pedestrian pace of the single best <em>Indiana Jones</em> adaptation to day, <em>Fate of Atlantis</em>) hrm that's weird, it's going to feel off to be playing an Indiana Jones game if he's suddenly been imbued with the strength and agility of a 1930s Nathan Drake.</p><p>How relieving it's been, then, to sit down and finally play the game, and find that he's actually one of the most relatable video game protagonists of all time. Indy is anyone <em>but </em>Nathan Drake. He's 38 years old by the time of <em>Great Circle</em>, getting on by any standards, but I'd wager especially so for the period, without the scientifically-formulated diet and strict exercise regime we expect a reasonably active 38-year-old from today to be engaging in.</p><p>Which is me easing into politely saying Indy is slow as shit. He's not that fit, panting after the shortest jog (though you can boost his stamina via upgrades throughout the game), and his body complains loudly when he has to crawl through things. He's really only equipped to take on one person at a time in melee combat, and even then that can be a struggle. Shooting, while present in the game, is a last resort; professional soldiers are much better at it than a university professor.</p><p>Everything seems a struggle for our guy, basically, and my favourite of Indy's various physical struggles is the game's platforming. There are no death-defying leaps or parkour-like jumps here; you are playing as a 38-year-old man and he moves like it. Climbing your whip elicits grunts like he can't get himself up off the couch, while clambering up a ledge sounds more Sisyphean than Herculean. This dude is struggling to get around, to the point where I feel bad asking him to do anything but walk in a straight line.</p><p>I feel bad partly because I am also a middle-aged man, and this shit is hard! I can't even walk down the stairs on a Friday morning after Thursday night five-a-side, so Indy's body protesting every time he's gotta haul himself over some stones is extremely relatable. There but for the grace of god, and a few decades of time (I even studied archaeology at university!), go I.</p><p>Playing as a slow, creaky 38-year-old doesn't sound fun when you put it like that, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I've seen some reviews paint <em>Great Circle</em> as an immersive sim, owing to how slow and methodical some of your actions are, like having to press a button to put a key in a door then push another button to actually open it. I guess in that way it <em>kinda </em>is (even if the true hallmark of an "immersive sim" is a branching game based on your choices, not a fastidious control scheme), but also this is just the Machinegames way, adapted to suit the material.</p><p>These guys have always obsessed over the first-person perspective, from when a bunch of them worked at Starbreeze on <em>Riddick</em> through to <em>Wolfenstein </em>and now this, and have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of its immersion with every game. While some things are new here compared to something like the <em>Wolfenstein </em>series--like the aforementioned door opening--the slower pace and less audacious moveset is mostly down to the fact we're playing a middle-aged academic here instead of a super soldier wearing power armour. If we're supposed to be walking in the character's boots, and that character is slow and methodical, then so is this game.</p><p>Which I don't think is immersive in terms of the genre label; it's just a recalibration of what we should expect from our playable characters. I like that Indy being slow makes me consider which missions I'm tackling on a larger map at any time, so I don't have to walk all the way across it for nothing. I like that not being able to leap huge chasms or clamber up walls makes me look at each room like I would as a human being, not as some hyperactive jackrabbit with a camera strapped to their neck.</p><p>All of which helps ground you in the experience in the most wonderful way. We're not playing a regular video game with Indiana Jones on the cover, where you can bounce off walls and kill six Nazis in a combo move. We're playing an Indiana Jones game AS Indiana Jones, tedium and downtime and goofs all, which makes it a triumph not just as an immersive experience, but as an adaptation as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-outlaws-review-impressions-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was only just talking about this the other day with <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>! About the joys of a great adaptation, of a team recognising what it is people really love about a thing and bringing it into a game. For <em>Outlaws</em> it was vibes, but here it's the man himself, with players able to possess Indy and play through all his limitations as well as his strengths. In <em>Outlaws </em>I was living in the Star Wars<em> </em>universe, but here the player IS the Indiana Jones universe.</p><p>It's an emphasis that's at the very heart of the game, with director Jerk Gustafsson<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/indiana-jones-the-great-circle-director-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> telling Inverse</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“To be honest, that was probably a harder sell internally...I remember reading this quote, I think it was from Spielberg who said ‘Indiana Jones is a non-superhero superhero.’ That became one of the core values of the project. Of course he’s still fit and can handle himself. But he’s also a 35-plus-year-old professor. I had this goal of trying to make it grounded in that way.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>They absolutely nailed it, and both me and my tired bones are so glad they did.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324594/intel-performance-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-cpus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel’s new Arrow Lake CPUs came out in October promising high performance at lower power levels, but reviews, including ours, noted surprisingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">lackluster gaming performance</a>. Tom Warren said of the Core Ultra 9 285K, “...in many titles, it provides worse performance than the 14th Gen chips it was designed to replace.”</p><div><p>Now, <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Field-Update-1-of-2-Intel-Core-Ultra-200S-Series-Performance/post/1650490">the troubled chipmaker says</a> it has been gradually releasing updates that fixed most of the issues it identified, as <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-arrow-lake-performance-fix-is-now-available-another-update-coming-next-month">reported earlier by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>.</p></div><p>“At the end of the day, there were four root issues that we needed to address, and fixes for those are actually already in the field right now,” Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6rwTGJTcOQ">during an interview with <em>HotHardware</em></a>. “They’ve been coming out over the last two weeks or so in drips and drabs, as update schedules allow.”</p><p>One issue stemmed from a “mistimed” update that was supposed to optimize Windows’ processor power management (PPM) system for Intel’s Core Ultra 200S-series processors. (PPM adjusts the performance of a CPU based on the current power plan, such as Balanced, High Performance, Power Saver, etc). </p><p>Instead of releasing the PPM update before reviewers got their hands on the processors, Intel says it scheduled the update to go out when it became widely available, which may have caused reviewers to see worse-than-expected performance. Due to the missing PPM update, Intel’s performance-boosting Application Performance Optimizer (APO) also couldn’t take effect in games, while “misconfigured” performance settings also had a negative impact on reviewers’ benchmarks.</p><p>A fix was already applied for these issues in&nbsp;Windows 11 build 26100.2161. Intel also says Epic Games resolved a driver compatibility issue <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">causing the blue screen of death</a> when running games with Easy Anti-Cheat, such as <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Intel is planning to release another set of performance upgrades for Arrow Lake CPUs in January, and it will “provide a comprehensive performance update” at CES. For now, Intel recommends updating Windows and applying the latest BIOS update to your motherboard if you haven’t already. Otherwise, you can wait until the “final” performance update next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Sword and Fairy 4: Remake Confirmed, Debut Trailer Released]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sword-and-fairy-4-remake-confirmed-debut-trailer-released.1064952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-4-remake-confirmed-debut-trailer-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For those who had the chance to play the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-and-fairy-7-is-the-latest-stunning-nvidia-rtx-graphical-showcase/">Sword and Fairy games</a> when they were younger, it has now been confirmed that Sword and Fairy 4 is being remade. This has been announced with a debut trailer, which showcases the game with new graphics, as the title has been made in Unreal Engine 5. The developers are using the latest technology to recreate the original Sword and Fairy 4 experience. At the moment, details about this game are very slim. However, it's known that the game will be available on console and PC in the future when it eventually releases.</p>
<p><iframe title="《仙劍奇俠傳四》重製版前導PV（繁中）" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hG4_GqYnKs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is being developed by Up Software and published by Cube Game. Again, it's relatively hard to find any information about these studios and their history in the game industry, as it will bring up a lot of irrelevant results on the search engine.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy 4 is a single-player RPG that is "reborn" using Unreal Engine 5, where you get to go on a journey full of adventure and battle to try and find the immortals with Tianhe Yun's team. On this journey, a hidden truth that has managed to remain hidden away from the public is starting to unravel, with people finding out the truth.</p>
<p>Sword and Fairy as a franchise is the most famous Chinese RPG series, but outside of South East Asia, it's unlikely that you will have heard of it, as it's not widely available internationally. As a result, people have had to turn to emulation and YouTube videos or Twitch streams to see more of Sword and Fairy.</p>
<p>For South East Asian gamers, it's very clear that this franchise means a lot, especially to the Chinese audience. From the comments alone that you can translate via Google, a lot of people are overjoyed and incredibly emotional about the game being remade, showing that the game has had a lot of emotional impact on gamers over the years. Many of the comments even refer to the original game as a masterpiece, so it seems that players are in for a great experience.</p>
<p>As the entire trailer is in Chinese, it's uncertain at the moment whether this game will be available globally or just be accessible to the Asian audience. Minimal details about the game have been revealed, as this is the first sighting of the Sword and Fairy 4 Remake.</p>
<p>The original Sword and Fairy 4 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam</a>, a title that was first released in 2007. However, if you want to play it, the game is only available in Chinese.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Friday, we brought you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">leaked dimensions of the next Nintendo Switch</a> from the most likely source yet: a “3D scan of the actual hardware” obtained by case manufacturer Dbrand. But case manufacturers aren’t the<em> only</em> source of leaks.</p><p>A Redditor named “NextHandheld” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hdvb2d/ive_come_from_the_future/">claims to have seen and touched</a> an actual final retail unit of the Nintendo Switch 2. I spoke with them, and I’ve now heard and seen enough to think they might be legit.</p><p>In particular, I’ve seen two photos of a possible Nintendo Switch 2 dock, and one photo of the <em>inside</em> of a possible Switch 2 controller rail, covered in certification logos and with copper contacts exposed, which also shows its metal kickstand hinge open at an angle. Notably, the dock was <em>not</em> included in the 3D scan that’s circulating among case manufacturers.</p><p>If NextHandheld is telling the truth, we now know a good bit more about Nintendo’s next console. For example: as much as we’d love it to be called the “Super Nintendo Switch,” it’ll likely be introduced as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.  </p><p><h3>Name and date</h3></p><p>Officially, Nintendo has only called it “the successor to Nintendo Switch,” promised to formally announce the new console <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">by March 31st, 2025</a>, and revealed that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">be backward compatible</a> with original Switch games.</p><p>Unofficially, NextHandheld’s source has heard it might be announced as soon as January — and shared what they claim is first-hand evidence with <em>The Verge</em> that it is the Nintendo Switch 2. I saw a picture of a dock, with the same logo as as the original Nintendo Switch, only with a 2 attached. </p><p>And while NextHandheld says they’re “disappointed” that the dock doesn’t seem to have any more ports than the original — two USB-A, one HDMI, one ethernet, and one USB-C likely used for its power brick — it may have a <em>different</em> trick up its sleeve.</p><p><h3>Magnetic controllers — finally with drift-resistant joysticks</h3></p><p>In April, <a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350770848/exclusiva-switch-2-conocemos-en-primicia-nuevos-detalles-de-la-proxima-consola-de-nintendo/">Spanish pub Vandal</a>&nbsp;(which correctly reported&nbsp;<a href="https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350744733/nuevos-detalles-exclusivos-de-switch-pro-pantalla-tamano-dock-llegada-a-europa/">minor details of the Switch OLED</a>&nbsp;before launch) reported that, incredibly, Nintendo might replace the Switch’s controller rails with <em>magnets</em> so your Joy-Cons can magically snap into place. </p><p>Today, it no longer seems incredible, because the photo I saw of a joystick rail region contains no rail: it’s just a long, rounded, hollow area, with a 13-pin connector that sticks out so it can slot into the Joy-Con. NextHandheld says there’s a physical magnetic click when you attach them, and that you’ll press a much larger button on the controller, one that’s physically connected to a magnet, to release. (You can see mockups of such buttons <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">in our Dbrand story</a>.)</p><p>More importantly, the Nintendo Switch 2 might finally get rid of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">the infamous “Joy-Con Drift” that plagues its controllers to this day</a>. NextHandheld claims the controllers will have magnetic Hall effect joysticks, which don’t contain the same deteriorating sensor material and can be recalibrated easily. </p><p><h3>A U-shaped kickstand</h3></p><p>The original Nintendo Switch had a tiny, easy-to-topple gumstick of a kickstand, and the Switch OLED had a wide, flat plate. But the Nintendo Switch 2 will feature a U-shaped rail of a kickstand, according to a photo that NextHandheld shared with me. </p><p>I understand that the 3D CAD file shows the U-shape, too — and case manufacturers have begun sharing images of similar U-shaped kickstands, too. But it looks like it could be beefier than some of the mockups floating around:</p><p><h3>Extra power when docked?</h3></p><div><p>Once upon a time, Nintendo was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade">reportedly planning to release a Nintendo Switch Pro</a>, one that would output 4K graphics when docked to your TV, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained">at least partly thanks to Nvidia’s DLSS AI upscaling</a>. That didn’t happen, but the Nintendo Switch 2’s dock might be designed to let the handheld run a bit faster. </p></div><p>On Reddit, NextHandheld cryptically teased that asking if the dock had a fan was “the right question,” and in a picture shared with <em>The Verge</em>, I can see the alleged dock has big feet <em>around back, </em>ones positioned so it can lie down horizontally without blocking a set of vents. </p><p>While I don’t imagine you’d intentionally put it on its back, as the handheld might fall out of the completely open slot up top, I can imagine Nintendo wanting to make sure the console doesn’t overheat if you accidentally knock it over. </p><p>Intriguingly, NextHandheld says the dock is rated for 60W, while the Switch 2 is rated for 45W, both of which would be substantially higher than the original if true. The original Switch had an unusual 39W charger for both docked and handheld modes, which only provided up to 18W for the handheld.</p><p><h3>The many things we still don’t know</h3></p><p>You can dig through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NextHandheld/comments/">NextHandheld’s Reddit comments</a> or read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hf06co/switch_2_ama_with_next_handheld_summarized/">this early summary</a> for a lot more possible details about the new console. But the Redditor is upfront that they never got to turn the handheld on, or play any games. They don’t know whether a Switch 2 can play original Switch cartridges, or only digital Switch 1 games. They don’t know if it has a microphone, or a camera, or how much storage space it has, or its performance, or anything about its reportedly 8-inch screen, or its launch titles.</p><p>They do say it will launch in dark grey, however, like the original Nintendo Switch, and that it will be followed by a white model, and one themed with a Nintendo game that hasn’t received a themed Switch yet. And, they’re the latest to possibly corroborate a new second USB-C port on the top, though that was obviously revealed in the 3D scan.</p><p>If it’s true that Nintendo will announce the Switch 2 in January, though, you won’t have to wait long for more answers — or to find out if these ones are true.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>

While on court, a woman read their Christmas letters to Santa and handed out gifts. One kid, who worked <em>really </em>hard to get good grades this year, wanted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">PlayStation 5</a></span> console. And that’s what the kid got. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see how happy he is in the video below</a></span>. But that video also claims that after halftime, staff took away the PS5 and replaced it with a jersey. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Boston 25 </em>explained</a></span> that cheerleaders and other people involved in the halftime event were reportedly confused when staff took away the kid’s PS5 gift. Apparently, the child’s uncle, likely the adult in the grey and blue hoodie in the video above, knew ahead of time that the gift would be taken away and failed to share that info with his nephew.</p><p>As you might expect, a team worth billions cheaping out and taking away a kid’s Christmas gift after pretending to give it to him in front of cameras didn’t go over well online. People rightfully called out the team and its staff for the horrible prank, and within 24 hours the Hornets issued an apology. </p><p>On Tuesday, the team said its “on-court skit...missed the mark” and blamed it on “bad decision making and poor communication.” </p><p><em>“</em>Simply put, we turned the ball over and we apologize. We have reached out to the family and are committed to not only making it right but to exceeding expectations,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the team in a statement shared by reporter Nick Carboni</a></span>. </p><p>“We will be providing the fan with the PS5 that he should have taken home last night along with a VIP experience to a future game. Our goal is and will remain to elevate the guest experience for every person that enters Spectrum Center, and to show our fans how much we appreciate their relentless support.”</p><p>And if you were wondering: The Hornets received karmic justice Monday night after taking away the kid’s PS5. The team went on to lose 121-108 to the Sixers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ultimate</em>. Gioeli alleges he wasn’t rightly compensated for these and other uses of the song.</p><p>Gioeli says in the lawsuit that he has personally “maintained and registered” the song with licensing agency BMI, and also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds the copyright</a></span> that lists him as the author that holds the rights and permissions for the composition and lyrics. According to the lawsuit, Gioeli says he was only aware “Live &amp; Learn” had been used in the original release of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, and was only clued into all the other times it had been used by a fan in 2024.</p><p>Gioeli is looking to the court for clarity on who owns the masters of the original song and is seeking compensation for all the uses of the song beyond those in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Gioeli confirmed earlier this year that he had signed a deal with Paramount allowing the use of “Live &amp; Learn” in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He has been in contact with at least two lawyers regarding the dispute, one from Sega who told him he didn’t have rights to the song, and another who allegedly called the song a “joint work,” making Gioeli entitled to “50 percent of Sega’s profits” from the song. The singer’s lawyer says that damages would include $500,000, along with at least another $500,000 for unpaid royalties.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Polygon</em>, Gioeli said he wants to maintain his relationship with Sega and doesn’t want this to sully the memories fans have made with Crush 40’s music.</p><p>“I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega,” Gioeli said in his statement to <em>Polygon</em>. “I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just.”</p><p>Crush 40 have been featured in several <em>Sonic</em> games since the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, having contributed music to games like <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, and <em>Sonic and the Black Knight</em>. Though their contributions to the series have become more scarce in recent years, their music has been re-used in several games, including this year’s <em>Shadow Generations</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        It works well, but there still aren't enough modern, console-style games.

      The Backbone One attachable game controller for the iPhone.

    <div>
                      
                      
          
<p>In theory, it ought to be as good a time as ever to be a gamer on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Classic console emulators have rolled out to the platform for the first time, and they work great. There are strong libraries of non-skeezy mobile games on Apple Arcade and Netflix Games, streaming via Xbox and PlayStation services is continuing apace, and there are even a few AAA console games now running natively on the platform, like Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil titles.</p>
<p>Some of those games need a traditional, dual-stick game controller to work well, though, and Apple bafflingly offers no first-party solution for this.</p>
<p>Yes, you can sync popular Bluetooth controllers from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and 8bitdo with your iPhone, but that's not really the ideal answer—your iPhone isn't a big TV sitting across the room or a computer monitor propped up on your desk.</p>
<p>A few companies have jumped in to solve this with attachable controllers that give the iPhone a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck-like form factor (albeit a lot smaller). There's a wide range of quality, though, and some of the ones you'll see advertised aren't very well made.</p>
<p>There's some debate out there, but there's one that just about anyone will at least put up for consideration: the Backbone One. That's the one I picked for my new iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I have loaded with emulators and tons of games.</p>
<p>Since many folks are about to get iPhone 16s for the holidays and might be in the market for something similar, I figured it'd be a good time to write some quick impressions, including pros and cons. Is this thing worth a $99 price tag? What about its subscription-based app?</p>
<h2>Switching from the Razer Kishi</h2>
<p>Here's some background, real quick: I previously owned an iPhone 13 Pro, and I played a lot of <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. I wanted to try the controller experience with that game, so I bought a first-generation Razer Kishi—which I liked for the most part. It had excellent thumbsticks that felt similar to those you'd find on an Xbox controller, if a little bit softer.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That said, its design involved a back that loosened up and flexed to fit different kinds of phones, but I found it annoying to take on or off because it immediately crumbled into a folding mess. The big issue that made me go with something else, though, was that the controller worked with a Lightning port, and my new iPhone traded that for USB-C. That's a good change, overall, but it did mean I had to replace some things.</p>
<p>The Kishi I had is now discontinued, and it's been replaced with the Kishi V2, which looks... less appealing to me. That's because it ditches those Xbox-like sticks for ones more similar to what you see with a Nintendo Switch. There's less range of motion and less stability.</p>

<p>The Backbone One has similar drawbacks, but I was drawn to the Backbone as an alternative partly because I had enough complaints about the Kishi that I wanted to roll the dice on something new. I also wanted a change because there's a version with PlayStation button symbols—and I planned to primarily play PS1 games in an emulator as well as stream PS5 games to the device instead of a PlayStation Portal.</p>
<h2>Solid hardware</h2>
<p>One of my big complaints about the first-generation Kishi (the folding and flimsy back) isn't an issue with the Backbone One. It's right there in the name: This accessory has a sturdy plastic backbone that keeps things nice and stable.</p>
<p>The PlayStation version I got has face buttons and a directional pad that seem like good miniature counterparts to the buttons on Sony's DualSense controller. The triggers and sticks offer much shallower and less precise control than the DualSense, though—they closely resemble the triggers and sticks on the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.</p>

<p>I feel that's a big downside. It's fine for some games, but if you're playing any game built around quickly and accurately aiming in a 3D environment, you'll feel the downgrade compared to a real controller.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The product feels quite sturdy to hold and use, and it doesn't seem likely to break anytime soon. The only thing that bugs me on that front is that the placement of the USB-C port for connecting to the phone is in a place where it takes enough force to insert or remove it that I'm worried about wear and tear on the ports on either my phone or the controller. Time will tell on that front.</p>

<h2>There’s an app, but...</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is not just a hardware product, even though I think it'd be a perfectly good product without any kind of software or service component.</p>
<p>There is a Backbone app that closely resembles the PlayStation 5's home screen interface (this is not just for the PlayStation version of the controller, to be clear). It offers a horizontally scrolling list of games from multiple sources like streaming services, mobile game subscription services, or just what's installed on your device. It also includes voice chat, multiplayer lobbies, streaming to Twitch, and content like video highlights from games.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Unfortunately, all this requires a $40 annual subscription after a one-month trial. The good news is that you don't have to pay for the Backbone One's subscription service to use it as a controller with your games and emulators.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone anywhere was asking for a subscription-based app for their mobile game controller. The fact that one is offered proves two things. First, it shows you just how niche this kind of product still is (and transitively, the current state of playing traditional, console-style games on iPhone) that the company that made it felt this was necessary to make a sufficient amount of money.</p>
<p>Second, it shows how much work Apple still needs to do to bake these features into the OS to make iOS/iPadOS a platform that is competitive with offerings from Sony, Microsoft, or even Nintendo in terms of appeal for core rather than casual gamers. That involves more than just porting a few AAA titles.</p>

<h2>The state of iPhone gaming</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is a nice piece of hardware, but many games you might be excited to play with it are better played elsewhere or with something else.</p>
<p>Hit games with controller support like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>, and <em>Infinity Nikki</em> all have excellent touch-based control schemes, making using a gamepad simply a matter of preference rather than a requirement.</p>
<p>While Apple is working with publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft to bring some hardcore console titles to the platform, that all still seems like just dipping toes in the water at this point, because they're such a tiny slice of what's on offer for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or even Nintendo Switch players.</p>
<p>In theory, AAA game developers should be excited at the prospect of having iPhone players as a market—the install base of the iPhone absolutely dwarfs all home and handheld consoles combined. But they're facing two barriers. The first is a chicken-and-egg problem: Only the most recent iPhones (iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 16 series) have supported those console AAA titles, and it will take a few years before most iPhone owners catch up.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Emulators like RetroArch (seen here running on an iPhone 16 Pro Max) are the main use case of the Backbone One.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The second is that modern AAA games are immensely expensive to produce, and they (thankfully) don't typically have robust enough in-game monetization paths to be distributed for free. That means that to profit and not cannibalize console and PC sales, publishers need to sell games for much higher up-front costs than mobile players are accustomed to.</p>
<p>So if mobile-first hardcore games are best played with touchscreens, and gamepad-first console games haven't hit their stride on the platform yet, what's the point of spending $100 on a Backbone One?</p>
<p>The answer is emulators, for both classic and homebrew games. For that, I've been pleased with the Backbone One. But if your goal is to play modern games, the time still hasn't quite come.</p>

The 990 Pro is a superb high-end SSD for PC, and it's one of the best SSDs you can buy for PS5. Since it has a heatsink preinstalled, it's PS5-ready out of the box.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vote-for-your-favorite-games-of-2024-in-the-ign-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A bracket of 64 titles will crown one ultimate winner.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From iconic names like Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy to indie sensations like Balatro and Animal Well, 2024 has provided gamers with a variety of incredible experiences. IGN is in the process of picking our game of the year, but now you have the chance to have your voice heard too in the IGN People’s Choice Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With our partners at Truth, we’ve selected 64 of the best titles of the year to be placed in a bracket and randomly sorted into groups. They’ll go head-to-head, with the winner moving on to the next round and the loser being eliminated. As the rounds progress, the competition will get tougher, until there’s only one title left standing as the fan-voted Game of the Year. If you’re familiar with how March Madness brackets work, it’s the same concept.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Tournament Schedule and How to Vote</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Voting will take place on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndotcom/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s Instagram</u></a> starting today, December 18. We’ll post the matchups to our Instagram stories around 3 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. CT / 12 p.m. PT, and you’ll have 24 hours to vote. The 32 winners will move on to the next round, where the process will repeat. Here are the dates when each round will be posted (around the same times listed above), so make sure to check back on our Instagram stories to continue voting for your favorite games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Round 1: December 18</li><li>Round 2: December 20</li><li>Round 3: December 23</li><li>Quarterfinals: December 27</li><li>Semifinals: December 30</li><li>Finals: December 31</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Which Games Are Grouped Together?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, the bracket placements of the 64 games we selected were randomized. They were split up into four groups, like the regions of March Madness. Group 1 is led by some heavy hitters: Helldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. But they’ll have to go up against breakout indie Animal Well. Plus, three popular sports games: Madden NFL 25, College Football 25, and MLB The Show 24. And you can’t look past the beautiful visuals of Unicorn Overlord and Infinity Nikki.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 2 is led by the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, but it’ll face stiff competition from a trio of RPGs — Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. There’s also heralded remasters and remakes from Nintendo with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And we can’t leave out the technical marvel Senua’a Sage: Hellblade II, or another standout indie in Lorelai and the Laser Eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 3 ended up stacked with three games that have been cleaning up during awards season: Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Black Myth: Wukong. They’re joined by an eclectic group of competitors. There’s entries from massive franchises in Star Wars Outlaws and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (which will face off against each other in Round 1). There’s games from other long-running series in Tekken 8 and Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. There’s the latest version of sports franchises in EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25. But also some notable new IPs with Stellar Blade and Slitterhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding things out, Group 4 is also full of some big names. First, there’s indie darling Balatro, which has also done very well for itself this awards season. But it’ll have to get through two huge RPG sequels in Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Dragon’s Dogma 2, as well as a popular RPG remake in Persona 3 Reload. And they’ll be up against several family-friendly opponents in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, LEGO Horizon Adventures, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Plucky Squire. Not to mention the often overlooked Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and surprise hit Enshrouded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see, this year is going to be a hotly contested race. So make sure you head over to Instagram to vote for each matchup and help determine which games will move on and which will be sent packing. It’ll all build to a big reveal of the fan voted Game of the Year. Happy voting!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-this-week.1064874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=46B0licP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=o0FY1M-Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video shows one of the features called NPC Copy &amp; Customize. As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=1VvhT2nK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=xFxSVshY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Custom NPCs made in this way or put into their own custom character area of the NPC sidetray, allowing Game Masters to quickly find and utilize their creations.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025.1064841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>



<p>Who else is worth watching when the CS2 2025 season begins?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

<p>In a statement the team said, “We will be shutting down (shut down) the Dark Alliance servers on 2/24/2025 and it will no longer be available to purchase starting that day. The base game and all DLC are still available to play in offline single player by anyone who currently owns it.”</p>

<p>In our Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance review, Reuben said, <em>“Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance fails to live up to both the potential of its placement in the D&amp;D canon and the legacy of the Dark Alliance name. As a mediocre-to-good game, depending on whether you’re alone or with friends, the whole experience is sluggish and dull in execution, and sails close to the average tabletop D&amp;D session where you play for four hours and somehow only walk down a single corridor, but without the enjoyment that comes with that experience.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Year 2 Content is Planned for Ubisoft’s Skull and Bones]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-year-2-content-is-planned-for-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-skull-and-bones.1064793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft plans to release year 2 content for its quadruple A game Skull and Bones.</p>



<p>That’s according to sources who have knowledge of the plans for the pirate action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Year 2 Season 1 is set to kick off sometime early next year with brand-new PvP gamemodes, places of interest (POIs), new world tiers, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also understood that Ubisoft is exploring more premium crossover events, with one source saying that one idea includes a Black Flag crossover event around the time of the release of Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian). But whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The news that Skull and Bones will be having Year 2 of content might surprise some, as the publisher <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently canceled XDefiant</a>, its free-to-play offering that saw nearly 300 people lose their jobs.</p>



<div><p>However, sources tell me that Ubisoft is fully committed to continuing the game’s support and that the player numbers “might surprise people.” Still, Insider Gaming could not verify the game’s current player count statistics.  At the time of writing, though, Skull and Bones get just shy of a peak of 200 concurrent players in 24 hours on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The game is currently slashed from its £49.99 price tag to just £20.00&nbsp;on the <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/skull-and-bones/6295077a27efc536e38350a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft store page</a>, with the publisher also offering a 6-hour free demo for those on PC should you wish to try.</p></div>



<p>Earlier this year, Insider Gaming reported that one week after the games release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skull and Bones saw an estimated 850,000 players</a>, which also included those who had played via Ubisoft’s free 8-hour game trial.</p>



<p>What do you think of Skull and Bones nearly a year on? Will you be giving Year 2 content a go? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Pikachu ex was perhaps the best, followed or rivalled by Mewtwo ex. Charizard ex followed in third place, and Starmie ex in fourth. Of these, Mewtwo ex and Starmie ex have received a slight boost, while Pikachu ex seems to be the target of a meta shift as many new cards are poised to take it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">Mythical Island is built around Mew</a>, the mythical relative and predecessor of Mewtwo. It therefore includes many Psychic type cards, but it's not the headliners like Mew ex itself that provide a bump but instead a new Item called Mythical Slab.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/slab-1734544821806.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look at the top card of your deck. If that card is a Psychic Pokémon, put it into your hand," reads the effect. "If it is not a Psychic Pokémon, put it on the bottom of your deck."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card draw effects are incredibly important in card games as they essentially reduce the random chance element and allow players to pull exactly which cards they need to execute winning combos. It's the reason why every deck in the game runs Poké Ball and Professor Oak; they let players draw cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mythical Slab is another card draw exclusive to Psychic types, so including it in a Mewtwo ex deck is practically an instant bump. It lets players dig through their deck quicker and pull the likes of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir to execute the deck's best play, removing some of the random chance that's perhaps the Mewtwo ex deck's greatest flaw.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/vap-1734544859120.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Starmie ex, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">a new Vaporeon variant threatens to make the infamous Misty card even more powerful</a>. It allows the transfer of Water Energy between Pokémon, essentially meaning Misty coin flips of three or more are no longer wasted and can boost myriad Pokémon at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, being a Fire type deck that's weak to Water, could see some reduced play as a result of this boost, but is otherwise largely unaffected by the Mythical Island expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Pikachu ex which seems to take the most hits, with several of the new cards seemingly designed with taking Pikachu ex down in mind. Pidgeot ex, for example, despite being weak to Electric Pokémon like Pikachu, has an ability that works directly against Pikachu ex's.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/pidgeot-1734544909048.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A three Colorless Energy attack does 80 damage plus 20 more for each of its opponent's Benched Pokémon. Unlike other meta leaders Pikachu ex relies on having a full Bench, as its attack does 30 damage times the number of Pokémon there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking the Bench against Pidgeot ex will only lead to disaster though, with Scattering Cyclone doing 140 damage in that instance, enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Colorless card can also take down Pikachu ex in one turn too. A new Tauros card is fairly simple, being a basic Pokémon with 100 HP and a single attack called Fighting Tackle. It does 40 damage for three Colorless Energy, unless its opponent is an ex Pokémon, in which case it does 120 damage.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/tauror-1734544948531.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This won't take down Mewtwo ex in one hit, nor Charizard ex, nor Starmie ex, but is just enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit. These Colorless cards likely won't fit into the aforementioned meta decks but they will fit into the also popular anti-meta category, in which players build decks with the sole purpose of taking down the likes of Pikachu ex and Mewtwo ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-meta-may-have-a-new-champ-as-celebi-ex-dominates">what's emerged as a potential new threat to the meta is Celebi ex</a>. It can be combined with a new Serperior card that doubles the value of all Grass Energy, allowing Celebi ex to do up to 100 damage with just one energy, up to 200 with two, up to 300 with three, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-major-update-as-mythical-island-expansion-drops">Mythical Island just arrived yesterday</a>, December 17, and the meta will no doubt continue to chop and change as time goes on and players discover new combos.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/celebi-1734544986791.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main game arrived around six weeks earlier on October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> may be out now, but the PS5 itself remains a popular gift this holiday season. A PS5 was even seemingly given to one young fan attending a Hornets game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina earlier this week. The NBA team brought the kid out to the court and pretended to give him a PS5 for Christmas before quickly taking it back after the cameras cut away.</p><p>The giveaway was captured on social media by Adam Turner, who shared the video below. Turner also said the Hornets only gave the kid a jersey after taking back the PS5.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You guys want to see a cheap sports organization?<br>In this video my best friend&amp;his nephew get called onto court for a special segment where they gift the kid a PS5 publicly… w/cameras off they TOOK IT AWAY and gave him a jersey.<br>😂 Take a bow <a href="https://twitter.com/hornets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hornets</a>… crushed the kid <a href="https://t.co/mcj5hhsuM5" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/mcj5hhsuM5</a></p>  — USMNT_STAN (@StanUsmnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This caused such an uproar that the Hornets subsequently issued an apology that claimed the giveaway was meant to be an on-court skit. The Hornets went on to say that the team has reached out to the family of the boy to offer him a PS5 and a VIP experience at a future home game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/hornets-apologize-after-pretending-to-give-child-ps5-and-taking-it-away-off-camera-230954440.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yahoo Sports</a>, the boy's uncle was informed ahead of time that he wouldn't be keeping the PS5, but apparently no one told the child. The story quickly picked up steam nationally and in the local press before the Hornets reversed course. Turner <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1869243676637217209" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequently wrote</a>, "Credit to Hornets for making it right [and] taking immediate action. Owning mistakes is a great thing and often organizations try to cover their tracks."</p><p>Until last year, NBA legend Michael Jordan was the controlling owner of the Hornets before selling the majority of his stake to a new ownership team.</p>
