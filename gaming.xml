		<p>Netflix has closed down its Southern California game studio, known as Team Blue, with the streaming giant seemingly reassessing the most ambitious part of its gaming strategy, if not the wider plan.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Game File</a>, Team Blue was reportedly charged with making AAA games, and Netflix had made some significant hires to that end, with former Overwatch producer Chacko Sonny, Halo co-creator Joseph Staten, and Sony Santa Monica’s art director Rafael Grassetti, having all been lured to the promise of whatever Netflix had planned.</p>


<p>The closure will naturally affect all of the staff at Team Blue and lead to the cancellation of projects, though these were reportedly still only in the early stages of development – the aforementioned trio joined in late 2022 and early 2023.</p>
<p>They still have their Helsinki-based studio, Texas-based mobile developer Boss Fight Entertainment, as well as Oxenfree develoer Night School Studio and Cozy Grove devs Spry Fox. It was reported this summer that they had <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/netflix-video-games-80-in-development/">more than 80 games in development</a> with both owned studios and external partners.</p>

<p>Team Blue was a bit of an outlier to Netflix’s broader strategy of creating tie ins to their TV series and filling out a library of smaller, predominantly mobile games to fill out a library of distractions for their main TV subscription. Yes, that has included things like Stranger Things, Emily in Paris, Queens Gambit and other tie-ins, but there’s also the GTA remaster trilogy, World of Goo and plenty others.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-face-collab-coming-to-hunt-showdown-1896-on-october-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you've been hoping for <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a> to experience some horror this season, then you won't have to wait much longer. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has paired up with Fun World to introduce <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204800/Hunt_Showdown_1896__Ghost_Face_Rampage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost Face</a>, the iconic killer from the slasher movie Scream, to the world of Hunt. The Ghost Face Rampage DLC comes with a couple of items that will make your game a lot of fun, including Ghost Face as a new Hunter. There are also two weapons and a tool that comes with the DLC. This includes the Hush, which is a Frontier 73C Silencer, Whisper, a Bornheim No. 3 Silencer and Life Taker, which is a knife.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost Face® Rampage | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_jvzit55Rc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As stated in the name of the weapons, they are completely silent, which offers players the opportunity to be a real danger on the battlefield and the opportunity to assassinate other players in close-quarter combat, as well as get some shots in from a distance with the Silencers.</p>
<p>For those who want the opportunity to try out this fun collaboration, the Ghost Face Rampage DLC will be available for $9.99 and will be available via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 as of October 24, 2024. To make sure Ghost Face didn't stick out like a sore thumb, he received a new design that allowed him to fit into the world of Hunt: Showdown 1896. Stefan Heinrich, Lead Art Director had this to say about the creation of Ghost Face:</p>
<p>"The character design was interesting to work on as it had to fit into the gritty, dark corners of the 1890s setting that Hunt is famous for. For example, the iconic mask is now a hand-carved wooded mask, weathered and cracked, a tattered battle worn duster replaces the robe and to complete the look, leather holsters and gear have been added, giving him the tools of a 19th Century Hunter while maintaining his iconic style."</p>
<p>There have been plenty of collaborations over the years of Hunt, and this is the first horror collaboration for Hunt: Showdown 1896, and will also be accompanied by an in-game event named Harvest of Ghosts which will be live until 25 November, 2024.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about the DLC and the event, make sure to check out the trailer, which is just over a minute long, to get more details on what you can expect from the Ghost Face Rampage DLC for Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-finally-revealed-for-november.1016244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leikir Studio and publisher Dotemu have announced the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>release date, so we finally know when they're bringing the long-awaited strategy RPG to PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1590760/view/4513261623769734603" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on November 5th, so you won't have much longer to wait if you've been eagerly anticipating the game for a while.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/all-of-summer-game-fest-2021-announcements">2021 Summer Game Fest celebration</a>, and it was originally intended for launch in 2022 before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-until-2023">delayed to 2023</a>. Naturally, it was then delayed further, so it's nice that the release date has been announced at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=cC1SfEy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-slug-tactics-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=9I_XybNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the release date been revealed, but it turns out that <i>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</i>is getting a fun little cameo at launch in the form of three characters from the&nbsp;<em>Ikari Warriors</em> (and, by extension,&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters</em>)&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern will be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, two of them returning from making cameos in previous&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>titles. Leona was first introduced in 1996 fighting game&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters '96</em>.</p>
<p>They'll each have a different special power to offer: Clark has "immense strength", Ralf uses "fiery punches" to attack his opponents, and Leona can "replace fallen enemies with decoy afterimages".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, it is, believe it or not, a tactical RPG spinoff of the&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>series. Rather than the frantic run-and-gun action of the main franchise,&nbsp;<em>Tactics&nbsp;</em>will offer a more thoughtful and considered gameplay style.</p>
<p>The game will feature a host of hand-crafted maps across its campaign, as well as "die-and-retry roguelite progression", lots of weapons and mods to choose from, and several iconic&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>characters for your army.</p>
<p><em>Metal Slug Tactics&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009982" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Metal-Slug-Tactics-2018254.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on November 5th.</p>

The channel’s final video went up today, and Sakurai capped it off with two surprise announcements. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,194842,197298" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The first unexpected reveal was that the content for his channel was almost all created at the start. The Sakurai that many fans thought they were seeing in each new video was actually from the past, as the videos were shot years ago. That Christopher Nolan-esque twist kicked off a final video for the channel dedicated to how it was made and what the famed game director plans to do now. Not surprisingly, it includes going back to making them.</p><p>Sakurai’s second reveal was that he had been pitching a new project back when the channel first started. The time jump means that, assuming the pitch got greenlit, the director’s new game might be ready for an official announcement not too far in the future. Whether it’s a game in the mold of <em>Smash Bros.</em> or something completely different, and whether it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-specs-leaks-nintendo-screen-release-date-price-1851651185">for the Switch 2</a></span> or another platform entirely, remains to be seen. </p><p>“I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed,” he said in the final video. “I’m sorry I can’t share more about this project, but assuming we’re able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the video, Sakurai shared a detailed look at how he organizes his day, plans out his official work and side hustles, and even when he goes to bed and how much sleep he gets (only about six hours on average). He also included some interesting stats about production costs and channel milestones. Sakurai estimated it cost about $600,000 to get all of the channel’s content edited and translated, as well as pay licensing fees for certain footage and crossover episodes with other companies. Had he billed himself for all of his own work and time scripting everything, the costs would have been even higher. But Sakurai confirmed it was all in service of an educational channel that he didn’t make any money from. </p><p>“It really was a silly decision,” he said. “However, and I truly mean this, I consider this an investment toward a brighter future for games.” He continued, “The world is constantly seeing new game releases. Lots of people are doing their best out there. Rather than add one more title to that deluge, I thought the channel might give all games a little quality boost and I hope from the bottom of my heart that I’ve contributed at least a bit of wind to the industry sails.”</p><p>In total, Sakurai released 260 videos, over 19 hours of content, with over 80 million views across it all, totaling 498 years of watch time. His Japanese and English language channels have over a million subscribers combined. Unfortunately, he also points out that given the “volatility” of the YouTube algorithm, there’s no telling when his videos will stop getting recommended and fade into the content background radiation of the rest of the platform. For now though, it sounds like the<em> Smash Bros.</em> icon will have more to share about his future game projects soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They point toward the occasional stuttering issue, but primarily the faithful recreation of the original, the superb voice acting, and improved combat mechanics that make the game feel more modern and alive. It’s a tense and frantic experience, and it seems to resonate with most people. Of course, there are even more positive reviews begging for Bloober Team to tackle the other <em>Silent Hill </em>titles, and after this game’s success, that’s a distinct possibility.</p><p>Whether

<p>Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to debut a whole heap of new Mastery Camos and bonus Camos to attain. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears are required to unlock them, so read on for full details about BLOPS 6’s extensive list of unlockable Camos.</p>



<p>Camos don’t just make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-launch-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a> look pretty, they provide an added layer of challenge to an already intense online multiplayer experience. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> not only brings back the classic Prestige System to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveling up</a> more fun, but it comes equipped with a backpack overflowing with creative and colorful Camos. </p>



<p>You’re dying to know about the Mastery Camos, I can feel it, and I’m going to delve into Black Ops 6’s most elite Camos, along with everything else you need to know.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Hours of content lie in wait. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 6’s Mastery Camos—and Camos in general—are <strong>special weapon skins unlocked by completing challenges and meeting requirements</strong>—such as getting a certain amount of headshots.</p>



<p>The Camo system has been a staple of the Call of Duty franchise dating back to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare where you needed to score headshots to unlock Blue Tiger, Red Tiger, and eventually Gold Camo. Fast forward to recent CoD games, and there are dozens, dare I say hundreds—of unlockable Camos to grind toward now.</p>



<p>The most coveted of all though is Mastery Camos—and they are the best of the best; requiring a lot of time and effort to obtain. I’m going to explain each set of Camos in Black Ops 6 and how to get them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-progression-leveling-prestiging-challenges-intel#weapon-camos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision has explained</a> each weapon is broken up into three distinct Camo categories: <strong>Military Camos</strong>, <strong>Special Camos</strong>, and <strong>Mastery Camos</strong>. Furthermore, the unlock conditions for a weapon’s Camo depend on the weapon itself, as well as which game mode you are playing.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 requires a certain amount of kills, Zombies asks for Critical Kills, and Warzone demands Eliminations.</p>

<p>When all nine Military Camos have been earned for a weapon, it’s time to pursue the Special Camos. “<strong>Each Weapon has two unique Special Camo Swatches per mode that can only be earned with that weapon only</strong>,” explains Activision.</p>



<p>The publisher is keeping the nature of Special Camos a secret, and it’s a surprise to be discovered for the full launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-mastery-camos">Mastery Camos</h3>



<p>You can earn <strong>four Mastery Camos for each gameplay component</strong> of this year’s main Call of Duty package: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone—giving you <strong>12 Mastery Camos</strong> to earn in total.</p>



<p>Again, these are endgame skins likely to take many hours to unlock—so be patient, you can sport the skin once you’ve put the work in!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth.1016199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kong-survivor-instinct-review-showing-teeth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a somewhat humorous precedent set with this Monsterverse malarkey. Here we are, a universe with giant sprawling kaiju that simply cannot stand each other, and in the middle of it? Terry Terranceson, 43, is on his way to a 9-5 so he can make ends meet, but Abbadon’s turned his place of work into a ground for spider spawn, and insurance might not cover it. It’s something <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em> touches upon if nothing else.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from the Poland-based 7Levels, a publisher and developer of several small, kitschy titles like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/railbound-on-track-for-puzzle-fun">Railbound</a> </em>and <em>Inbento</em>. When compared to their past catalog, <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em> is arguably their most ambitious title to date, with explicit tie-ins to the Legendary Pictures Monsterverse movies. With that much riding on it, you’d be sure of an intense adventure.</p>
<p>You play as David, an oil rig worker who is alerted of a Titan attack involving Kong happening in the city. Concerned for the safety of his daughter Stacy, he makes his way towards the inner city, crashing his car and ending up in between Kong and Co. smashing the place up. After butting heads with a rogue organization known as Hyenas, led by Alan Jonah from the Monsterverse films, David attempts to avoid both him and Kong in a race to save his daughter.</p>

<p>This may all sound terribly exciting to you, the reader, but <em>Survivor Instinct</em> is heading towards a more somber, deeper route. Whenever you start the game up, it warns the player that the narrative will deal with serious themes, such as “DISASTERS” and “DEATH”. The rather inexplicable description of these themes made me think the game was to take a much more stern tone, and the gameplay certainly expanded that belief.</p>
<p>It’s a 2.5D realistic platformer, by way of your <em>Flashback</em>’s or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadlight-directors-cut-review-lot-more-needed-to-be-cut"><em>Deadlight</em></a>’s, with Metroidvania-esque level design, and some ruff-n-tuff combat that felt reminiscent of something like Ubisoft’s <em>I Am Alive</em>. It’s the combat that’ll get the most focus throughout, as from near the start of the game up until the end, you will be dealing with several Hyena forces, and constantly learning how to effectively work the combat mechanics.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it’s all quite intuitive and balanced to a point. There’s a good mix of techniques to use in order to keep the enemy second-guessing, both melee and ranged combat have their benefits, and certain arenas provide environmental traps. It’s when the option to parry arrives, which is where the game falls apart, difficulty-wise, as nothing stops you from simply spamming the button and getting enough hits in to not worry.</p>

<p>Enemies can also respawn in areas previously visited, a rare occurrence not just through spawn chance, but also because this is the most linear Metroidvania you’ll ever play. It’s more like microcosms of the experience as levels, so… yeah, just linear. It’s hard to explain, but there’s never an instance where you feel <em>Survivor Instinct</em> BEING a Metroidvania elevated the quality of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Progression is a double-edged sword here. On the one hand, the actual growth David has mechanically, against both the forces of Hyena, and the titans duking it out around him, is pitch-perfect. Character upgrades, while tied to story progression, are placed appropriately, tools get switched out with other, better solutions, and the level design does well to implement all of them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, points of no return plague <em>Survivor Instinct</em> right to the very end, to the point where the definition of a Metroidvania is stretched to the point of tearing apart. Almost everything you can acquire in an area is grabbed then and there, there is no desire to return to find more because it’s already been found, or it's tied to a narrative beat nearby.</p>

<p>Still, <em>Survivor Instinct</em> has other ways of providing excitement, like the actual implementation of Kong and his Monsterverse buddies. Every once in a while, David will be forced to escape the gargantuan force of his undefeatable foes, which results in some fairly intense and engaging chase sequences. The levels crumble around you, the scale is recognized, and they vary how you can outsmart and outrun them.</p>
<p>They’re sprinkled all throughout the main story and are indeed one of the few things you’ll look forward to as you progress through the story of <em>Survivor Instinct</em>. I won’t explicitly spoil the story, but it’s a rare case of watching a completely static chain of events play out, one that refuses to move forward or backward, and disregards characterization, motivation, and theming, all for the sake of previously-established LORE.</p>
<p>It’s to the point where I personally feel its dedication to the Legendary Pictures Monsterverse hurts it.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Well, picture it like this. Imagine if, say, Alfred Hitchcock’s version of <em>Psycho </em>stopped at the shower scene, with Marion Crane on the floor. It zooms into the newspaper and fades to black. However, when you search it up, it turns out that Hitchcock had to stop it there, because the original writer, Robert Bloch, had yet to write how Marion’s sister Lila would be involved with the story.</p>

<p>All of this wouldn’t be so bad if David wasn’t such a sack of wet gravel, characteristically. The delivery of his lines is so stilted and awkward against the general tone of the story and always feels like he just stumbled across the narrative by accident. His reasoning or desires never really come to fruition, by will of the writing or otherwise, and Kong’s presence isn’t felt properly.</p>
<h2><em>Kong: Survivor Instinct </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>There are some elements <em>Survivor Instinct</em> gets right. Its touting as a realistic platformer is felt, but the Metroidvania elements are underbaked and compromise the whole package. Kong’s presence, and his rivals, are roaring and appropriately scaled, but not nearly utilized enough throughout the story. Whether it’s through the powers that be or otherwise, you have a game that’s primarily fighting against its own legacy to speak out or make a mark, and it barely succeeds at either.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Kong: Survivor Instinct </strong>was reviewed on Xbox Series S with a copy provided by the developer over the course of 12 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024.1016196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-try-october-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steam Next Fest is drawing to a close and I’ve had the opportunity to try out a number of interesting indie games thanks to the over 3,000 demos. Many of them are interesting, and there are so many that I could hardly see them all, but here are 10 that you should definitely be paying attention to.</p>
<h2><em>Dinocop</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3187010/Dinocop?snr=1_7_15__13" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dinocop"><em>Dinocop</em></a> is a charming adventure/investigation game where essentially the plot of <em>Jurassic Park </em>happened in the backstory… and then the dinosaurs all became sapient and are sharing a world with humans. As a specially engineered raptor, you are the first ever dinosaur cop, and you’re partnered with the most cliche, racist cop possible and sent to investigate a case of mystery meat to uncover whether it is human meat, which is illegal.</p>

<p>What follows is an exploration of ideas, with a strong comedic bent as issues of classism, racism, and how we all interact come together with a purposefully ridiculous world to let us examine these ideas from different angles. Investigate and find out what is going at the convention as you try to gather clues about the mystery meat.</p>
<p>Choose what events happen during the conference you will attend, what questions you’ll ask, and what leads are important to you. It’s charming, sharply written, and needing a bit more polish on the UI but is brimming full of potential and promises to be a lot of fun.</p>
<h2><em>Sultan’s Game</em></h2>
<p><em>Sultan’s Game </em>is a narrative board game designed for a digital existence, and it's promising with a lot of interesting ideas. It’s a game you’ll be playing through multiple times to see different endings and paths you could take, as you try to survive the titular <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/Sultan's%20Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game?snr=1_7_15__13"><em>Sultan’s Game</em></a>… or even win it. What do you value most, and what choices will you make when you have to make terrible choices?</p>

<p><em>Sultan’s Game </em>adds on a sort of roguelite meta progression element. Because of the nature of the game, you are going to end up with times where the Sultan executes you for failing a task. You can improve your protagonist, or followers at the start, making it easier in future runs to get further when combined with the increased player knowledge.</p>
<h2><em>Knights in Tight Spaces</em></h2>

<p>If you liked <em>Into the Breach </em>or are interested in highly deterministic strategy games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Knights in Tight Spaces"><em>Knights in Tight Spaces</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>needs to be on your watchlist. As a sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fights-in-tight-spaces" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fights in Tight Spaces"><em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em></a>, it also includes the deckbuilding elements, but it dresses it all up in a much more appealing fantasy setting and style, giving it a very <em>Dungeons and Dragons </em>type feel compared to the previous game.</p>
<h2><em>Ballionaire</em></h2>
<p>Anything can be a roguelite these days as games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" High-Stakes: How Balatro Confronts Gambling Addiction and Roguelikes"><em>Balatro</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>have shown us, with well known games like Poker getting a roguelite glowup. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ballionaire"><em>Ballionaire</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>isn’t the next <em>Balatro </em>necessarily, but it’s drawing from a similar well, with Ballionaire turning Pachinko (or as you may know it from the <em>Price is Right</em>, <em>Plinko</em>) into a roguelite type of game.</p>

<p>Like <em>Balatro </em>you have increasing scores you need to meet, and the deckbuilding type element has you building the Pachinko board that you will drop the balls down with different bumpers and effects. It’s a lot of fun, and surprisingly strategic as you try to set up potential combos and get the highest scores possible.</p>
<h2><em>Commander Quest</em></h2>
<p>Keeping with the roguelite theme, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697930/Commander_Quest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Commander Quest"><em>Commander Quest</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>is another game that makes use of the tools of that genre, particularly in the deckbuilder style. One can essentially call this a marriage of a <em>Slay the Spire </em>style deckbuilder (the map between battles is clearly based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/slay-spire-review-fearful-synergies" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Slay the Spire review"><em>Slay the Spire’s</em></a>) and an autobattle strategy game.</p>

<p><em>Commander Quest</em> was a lot of fun with the interactions between different units, and the different scenarios that the game tosses at you prompt you to think about how to solve the various battles you partake in.</p>
<h2><em>ColdRidge</em></h2>
<p>Continuing our walk down roguelite lane, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ColdRdige">ColdRidge</a> </em>takes the concept to an exploration board game type feel. In <em>ColdRidge</em>, you are in an odd western type society as a contracted surveyor in a world full of brutal winters. You take different jobs, to survey areas and find certain supplies for the town, seeking to find what you pledged in the run-based game.</p>

<p><em>ColdRidge</em>’s focus on movement economy, exploration, and its lack of conflict make it an appealing different type of roguelite experience. The focus on resource acquisition, finding things in different areas, and weighing risks for what you can uncover make it a fun game to play.</p>
<h2><em>Tower Factory</em></h2>
<p>Continuing our weird walk through roguelites, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707490/Tower_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tower Factory"><em>Tower Factory</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>marries some roguelite progression ideas and methods to a tower-defense game, with an automation focus. It’s like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/defense-grid-2-review-definition-genre" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Defense Grid 2 Review"><em>Defense Grid</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>met <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> </em>with some rogue spice tossed in for the relationship.</p>

<p>The enemy and tower variety are cool, and there’s some neat different things you can do with the factory side of resource management, which will be interesting to see expanded out over the whole game. The roguelite side of things is perhaps the clunkiest part, as some of the metaprogression feels like it is holding back the game, like starting resources needing to be unlocked causing a very slow start until you get that. It needs some tuning.</p>
<h2><em>Sulfur</em></h2>
<p>Rounding out our stroll through the roguelites, we go to one that is a more standard actiony dungeon crawling&nbsp; roguelite, but to reduce <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124120/SULFUR?snr=1_7_15__13" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sulfur"><em>Sulfur</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>to that would be to ignore its delightful weirdness. The art style, the vibes, and the general premise of being a priest in a purgatory-type realm seeking a being of darkness that cursed your town, are intentionally cast as weird and give it a unique charm.</p>

<p>Meet odd characters, shoot and slice your way down the depths of the realm, and make sure to go back to town sometimes or when you die, you’ll lose all your supplies. <em>Sulfur </em>is a polished, fun game to play with a unique vibe that releases on Oct. 28, so make sure to take a look at it.</p>
<h2><em>Tiny Bookshop</em></h2>
<p>Admittedly, this game may appeal to you less if you are less of a bibliophile than me, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Tiny Bookshop"><em>Tiny Bookshop</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>appeals to that side of me. This cozy life sim game has you arrive in a town by the sea, with a closed wagon that makes up your shop. Stack it with books, meet people, and figure out what books the people of this town may want.</p>

<p><em>Tiny Bookshop </em>goes for a sort of timeless vibe, with the books in it referencing published works through at least the 2010s, but it lacks any sort of internet or phone in the few days the demo lets you play. It captures the spirit of small town, and like most of these cozy simulation type games, avoids many of the frustrations that real business ownership brings with it. It was fun to hang out, picking out books to sell, matching people to specific books when that came up, and just a chill time over all.</p>
<h2><em>Kill the Shadow</em></h2>
<p>We began the list with a comedic detective game, and we’ll end it with a much more serious one. Shadowlight Sanctuary’s game has you playing as Detective Lucas to solve difficult cases about a variety of things, uncovering mysteries that others may feel were best left buried.</p>
<p>Unlike some games in this genre, you are able to miss clues and make wrong conclusions based on it (like I did in one demo play), without it ending the game--instead it goes on with the consequences of that choice.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660230/Kill_The_Shadow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kill the Shadow"><em>Kill the Shadow</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>gives you a robust set of tools to uncover the clues and solve cases, so it feels like you messed up when you missed something--not the game. It’s combined with a dark post-war type of setting that gives it a gritty feel that works very well with this type of experience.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Those were my picks for 10 Steam Next Fest Games from October 2024 that you should try, or keep an eye on. With over 3,000 games this time around, there were so many games in Next Fest that I hope I highlighted something that interests you, that you may have missed.

<p>The PS5 Pro Enhanced version of Alan Wake 2 will receive an upgraded version of the Quality and Performance modes. Both modes will use Sony’s new&nbsp; PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution or PSSR upscaling technology to provide better clarity and detail.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-quality">Quality</h2>



<p>Starting with Alan Wake 2’s Quality Mode on the PS5 Pro, players can expect features such as 30 fps with ray tracing and ray-traced reflections (opaque and transparent). The output resolution in Quality mode will be 4K (3840 x 2160), whereas the render resolution will be 2176×1224. Ray Tracing wasn’t available on the standard PS5 version of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Axis Unseen, the first title from Just Purkey Games, is a horror game set to heavy metal, focusing on hunting down nightmarish creatures, unlocking unique abilities, and exploring a dark, mythological world. It’s indie, from one of the developers who worked in Skyrim and Fallout, and despite its rough edges, you’ll find a thrilling adventure. But for some, it’s all about unlocking those The Axis Unseen achievements. Here’s how to do it!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-axis-unseen-achievements-guide">The Axis Unseen Achievements Guide</h2>



<p>The Axis Unseen features 46 achievements to unlock, most of which you’ll acquire through normal gameplay means in a single playthrough. A few, however, require you to explore your surroundings, uncover additional powers, and find new equipment to bolster your capabilities. You should unlock most in a single go, though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kong: Survivor Instinct]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kong-survivor-instinct.1016184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>If you’ve ever wondered what the arcade classic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/rampage">Rampage</a> would be like if you had to play as a puny human rather than one of the skyscraper-smashing goliaths, then Kong: Survivor Instinct might be your answer. This 2.5D Metroidvania platformer takes place amidst a crumbling coastal cityscape while Kong and his kaiju combatants duke it out in the background, making it seem at first glance a bit like a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-complex">Shadow Complex</a> situated within <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>. It’s a novel enough concept, but basic environmental puzzle design and uninspired combat mean that Survivor Instinct is unable to reach the towering heights of its ideas, and as I begrudgingly pushed crates and collected keys to make my way through each ruined urban rabbit hole I could never really shake the impression that Kong seemed to be having considerably more fun than I was.  </p><p>Not that actually playing as Kong would be a guaranteed good time, of course – 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-island-rise-of-kong">Skull Island: Rise of Kong</a> was such an unmitigated disaster that the aftermath of its self-destruction is probably still being studied by scientists from the Monarch organization. Kong: Survivor Instinct is a notably better game than that, but once the novelty of having the iconic angry ape messing about in the middle distance fades it just doesn’t have the level of creativity or player freedom that other superior games of this ilk released in recent years – such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blasphemous-2">Blasphemous 2</a> – have so expertly displayed.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kong: Survivor Instinct Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It also doesn’t have much of a story beyond “Don’t get smashed by the monkey.” We play as David Martin, a single dad in search of his daughter who’s gone missing in the midst of the spectacular, city-ravaging royal rumble that’s currently sweeping along the west coast of the United States. The elevator pitch of David’s personality is basically a sort of middle-aged Nathan Drake who’s apparently forgotten how to be funny (almost every time he kills a labrador-sized spider he deadpans “I was never fond of spiders”), and the handful of survivors he meets along the way don’t even pretend to be real characters. There are also a couple of appearances from the villainous Alan Jonah, who was last seen in 2019’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-2-legendary-pictures">Godzilla: King of the Monsters</a> – there he was played by a typically cold and ruthless Charles Dance (AKA Tywin Lannister in <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>), but here he’s voiced by a somewhat subdued soundalike. None of these details really matter, though, since Kong: Survivor Instinct’s slight amount of story is stretched thin over its six-hour frame until it suddenly snaps apart during its jarringly abrupt and underwhelming conclusion.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kong: Survivor Instinct’s slight amount of story is stretched thin over its six-hour frame until it suddenly snaps apart.</p></div><h2>Surface Tension</h2><p>The story may be weak, but the look and feel of its crumbling 2.5D environments is undoubtedly its strength. David’s quest leads him from smoldering suburban outskirts to devastated downtown areas and the mysterious subterranean facilities below, and each dilapidated diorama is rich with precise detail and convincing depth. Kong: Survivor Instinct does perhaps try a bit too hard to convince you that every structure you explore is an unstable one with the repetitive routine with which it collapses the floor beneath your feet or drops chunks of the ceiling onto your skull, and that does get old pretty fast. However, it also allows you to scamper along the roofs of cars suspended by the webs of a towering arachnid, and navigate your way through the slanted corridors of an apartment building that’s been violently upended by Kong, so there are some more interesting platforming sections among them.</p><p>It’s just a shame that so much of the exploration is built around the same pushing of crates and shooting of padlocked gates. The very best Metroidvanias – like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> – gradually empower you with new tools and abilities that incentivise you to backtrack through the world and unlock previously unreachable areas, but Kong: Survivor Instinct is comparatively light-on when it comes to evolving the ways in which you interact with your surroundings. Here, by contrast, David is given a sledgehammer to smash through weakened walls and eventually a grappling hook to scale up to specific anchor points, but otherwise his progression is always painfully obvious and consists of the same rehashed circuit boxes to shoot or generators to repair, copied and pasted along the winding path towards each mission objective.</p><p>This general absence of ingenuity also drains the enjoyment out of its combat, which is primarily geared towards melee attacks since ammunition for David’s pistol is so scarce. There is some nuance to each scrap with Jonah’s soldiers – you can block or parry their blows to open them up for a counter attack or grab them to use them as a human shield when their more heavily armed comrades open fire, and I was pleased to discover that you can even shoot them in the leg to drop them to their knees so that you can deliver a series of finishing blows <em>a la </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. At the same time, there’s a stiffness to each scrap, particularly when David finds himself surrounded, and since he’s unable to jump or climb while he’s locked in a combat stance there were times where I’d knock an enemy off a ledge, only to find myself unable to drop down and continue the fight. Annoyingly, the only way forward was to reload my save.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Furthermore, rather than introduce any interesting new enemy types that require you to adapt your methods of attack, Kong: Survivor Instinct just gradually ups the numbers of foes in each encounter while keeping your combat abilities exactly the same. David’s pistol can be upgraded to carry more rounds per magazine to help counter the swelling hordes, but there are no other firearms to find despite the fact that every other goon you come across in the story’s second half seems to be toting a pump-action shotgun. When you consider that outside of the human soldier types there are only a couple of small spider-like enemies to contend with – and absolutely no boss fights whatsoever – Kong: Survivor Instinct’s combat feels flatter than a kaiju’s couch cushion overall.</p><h2>Raze the Roof </h2><p>While there might not be any traditional boss fights, Kong: Survivor Instinct does feature a handful of sequences that could best be described as boss <em>flights</em>. At specific points during the story, Kong or one of his rival titans will spot you through the window of a structure and you’ll be suddenly forced to flee, with the monster punching wrecking ball-sized holes in your path that require some pinpoint platforming to evade. (Sadly, none of these titans is Godzilla.) These sections certainly inject a burst of excitement and urgency into the adventure, although they also involve a fair amount of trial and error to get around instant deaths, which did lead to some frustrating repeated checkpoint restarts at times. Still, watching one of these monolithic beasts unwrap the building you’re trapped inside of like a kaiju kid on Christmas morning is undoubtedly one of the most spectacular tricks that Kong: Survivor Instinct has up its sleeves – even despite the seismic impact these high-intensity moments seem to inflict on the frame rate while playing on PlayStation 5.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Top 10 Metroidvania Games</h3><p>Metroidvania? More like Metroid insane-ier!</p></div><p>Unfortunately, those are the only times that Kong and company have a measurable impact on the action. Elsewhere, these goliaths are only ever glimpsed – either having an incidental tussle in the distant background, or when you summon one by collecting the requisite number of biowaves scattered around each level to clear a blocked path towards a level’s exit in a game of supersized simian Simon Says. It’s certainly a treat to watch Kong casually pick up a connected row of train carriages like they’re steel sausage links and violently wrench them apart, but the operative word here is “watch.” Once these path-clearing actions have been performed, it’s straight back to the same plodding puzzle-platforming and uninspired combat. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Setting a Metroidvania-style platforming adventure against a backdrop of building-razing beasts is certainly an intriguing idea, but unlike its towering cast of kaiju cameos, Kong: Survivor Instinct itself simply doesn’t measure up. Its story and characters are underwritten, its ravaged urban playground is eye-catching but not particularly surprising to explore, and its combat fails to evolve enough to keep the fights interesting over the course of the journey. The occasional room-rocking escape sequences do literally shake things up, but they’re few and far between and only distract from the otherwise uncomplicated platforming for short bursts at a time. Kong and his kind may hail from an alternate world hidden deep inside the Earth’s core, but the actual gameplay of Kong: Survivor Instinct is strictly one-dimensional.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Kong: Survivor Instinct</h3></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This gritty first-person shooter franchise saw five games come out from 2004 to 2013 for a range of PlayStation consoles as Sony took on Xbox's Halo, culminating in PlayStation 4 launch title <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/killzone-shadow-fall">Killzone Shadow Fall</a>.</p><p>But fans haven’t heard a peep out of Killzone ever since (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-no-new-killzone-in-sight-fans-at-least-have-a-t-shirt-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">save a T-shirt in The Last of Us Part 2: Remastered</a>), with the last decade and, seemingly, beyond devoted to the smash hit Horizon franchise. Based on comments from one of Guerrilla’s developers, perhaps we now know why.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a> to discuss the impending launch of spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, art director Roy Postma, who has worked at Guerrilla since 2000, declared the studio’s preference for the brighter, more vibrant world of Horizon over the dark and violent world of Killzone it had spent the previous decade working on.</p><p>“We were done with it as a team,” Postma said. “As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of Killzone.”</p><p>That’s clear enough, but Postma added that as far as Guerrilla (and no doubt Sony) is concerned, Horizon is a world with wider appeal than Killzone’s.</p><p>"I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world,” Postma added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Killzone fans have, on and off, called for a return to the series, with PlayStation lacking a successful first-person shooter of its own. During the PS4 generation, Sony leaned heavily on marketing deals with Activision for the Call of Duty series, which secured timed exclusive DLC as well as more benefits. That partnership, of course, is now over following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Will Sony eventually return to Killzone? If it does, it might need a developer other than Guerrilla to revive it, perhaps with a remake of one of the earlier games before a proper sequel or reboot. Guerrilla is currently working on a live service Horizon Online multiplayer game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off"><u>with Horizon 3 potentially a ways off</u></a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered"><u>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</u></a> launches at the end of October.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has ended his popular YouTube channel by teasing the upcoming announcement of a mystery new game.</p><p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/_qPqBilhEtI?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final video</a> from the Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games YouTube channel, Sakurai revealed that he received a video game development proposal in July 2021, as he was busy putting together the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Kazuya reveal video as well as DLC character Sora.</p><p>Production then began in April 2022, which makes it two-and-a-half years in the making. Sakurai added that, assuming this video game is completed, it should be announced “sooner or later,” though he didn't say anything more specific.</p><p>“I received a request to write a game proposal, which I finished at lightning speed,” he said. “I’m sorry I can’t share more about this project, but assuming we’re able to get it made, it should be announced sooner or later.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/screenshot-2024-10-22-123738-1729597818004.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games: Finale Special / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p>(Sakurai also revealed that until recently, all the footage of him for his channel was recorded two-and-a-half years ago, if you were wondering why he all of a sudden looks older.)</p><p>There’s little to go on, but it’s good news for Sakurai’s army of fans who had wondered what he’d do next having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-says-his-work-on-super-smash-bros-ultimate-is-now-done">wrapped up work on Switch exclusive Super Smash Bros. Ultimate earlier this year</a>. Some even speculated that Sakurai might have retired.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched in 2018 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-ultimate-last-dlc-character-sora-kingdom-hearts"><u>Sora arrived as its final expansion fighter in 2021</u></a>. The Kingdom Hearts character wrapped up an 89 character roster for the game, which includes fighters from The Legend of Zelda, Pokémon, Banjo Kazooie, Dragon Quest, Persona, Mega Man, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Minecraft, and many more.</p><p>Sakurai said in October 2023 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-director-doesnt-see-how-the-franchise-can-get-any-bigger-than-ultimate"><u>he's not sure where to take Super Smash Bros. next</u></a>, because "it's difficult to imagine an increase of this magnitude happening again.”</p><p>What might Sakurai’s next game be? Nintendo is preparing to announce <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">its Switch successor console</a>, and there will surely be more Smash Bros. games given the incredible success of Ultimate (34.66 million sales and counting). Perhaps yet another sequel is now in the works, but is Sakurai involved?</p><p><em>Image credit: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games: Finale Special / YouTube.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has cut the price of the Japan-set <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' Collector's Edition by $50 in lieu of the cancelled Season Pass, scrapped early access plans, and the game's delay to 2025.</p><p>The developer confirmed the price drop in a Discord post, telling fans it would now cost $229.99 instead of $279.99 and no longer contain a handful of the bonuses originally announced.</p><p>Ubisoft was a leading publisher behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-day-one-missions-only-available-through-season-pass-or-by-preordering">the recent trend of offering "early access" to its games</a>, which many have said is simply about charging fans more money to play often single-player games on their actual release date, and forcing those who stick to the standard $70 edition to wait three extra days.</p><p>Ubisoft had already made clear this would no longer be on offer for Assassin's Creed Shadows, announcing a single February 14, 2025 release date following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">a delay to its original plan of releasing the game across two dates next month</a>: November 12 and November 15.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/collectors-edition-1715790934905.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Collector's Edition originally included more than it does now.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But getting to play Assassin's Creed Shadows on its actual release date of November 12 was one benefit of the Collector's Edition and, alongside <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">the also included Season Pass being scrapped</a>, many fans who'd already committed to paying $279.99 wondered how that cost would be made up.</p><p>Finally, almost a month after Ubisoft announced the delay and other changes, the company has confirmed the price drop for the Collector's Edition. "The content will mostly remain as initially advertised, though some design elements may change," it said.</p><p>The Collector's Edition now includes the game, a statue of dual protagonists Naoe and Yasuke, an art book, a life sized replica of Naoe's katana tsuba, a world map, wall scroll, and two lithographs for the $229.99 price tag.</p><p>Ubisoft hasn't enjoyed the promotional campaign it perhaps hoped for after revealing Assassin's Creed Shadows, a franchise entry set in Feudal Japan that fans have requested for years.</p><p>Some expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This comes despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make the game as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p>It also emphasised its collaboration with external consultants and historians, but "despite these sustained efforts, we acknowledge that some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community," Ubisoft said. "For this, we sincerely apologize."</p><p>Concern was also raised when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows Concept Art With Historical Re-Enactment Group's Flag</h3></div></output><p>Yet another controversy came as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p>All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p>Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

According to five former workers who spoke to Game Developer (all requested anonymity to speak freely, given they had signed non-disclosure agreements as part of their severance packages), everyone at the studio was barred from revealing news of the purchase to anyone outside the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forte Labs says this was not a rule it implemented.

What's stranger is Phoenix Labs wasn't the only company Forte owned and reportedly demand be kept secret. After the aforementioned developers were laid off in May 2024, they were surprised to learn they weren't the company's only game studio. At the time of the layoffs, they had been sibling organizations with mobile game studio Rumble Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A former employee of Rumble Games (who also requested anonymity) confirmed to Game Developer that they and their colleagues had been also sworn to secrecy about their new owner when Forte purchased the company in March of 2024.

"This is kind of like that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022 Forte struck a deal with Australian gambling machine manufacturer Aristocrat Leisure. Aristocrat is the parent company of mobile game publisher Plarium, which had acquired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alliance: Heroes of the Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Rumble Games in 2017. Forte pitched Aristocrat on funding Rumble Games' next title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towers and Titans</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

The former Rumble Games employee we spoke with said what followed was a "shitshow."

The timeline is unclear because Phoenix Labs employees don't recall being told exactly when the transition took place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first, then-CEO Jesse Houston referred to Forte as being an "investor" in the company, but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/reshuffle-at-dauntless-dev-phoenix-labs-as-ceo-and-coo-step-down">after he left the studio,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> employees realized it was their new owner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with Rumble Games, employees were again reportedly prohibited from publicly stating that Forte had bought the company. Sources from both companies did not remember signing an NDA specifically barring this, but that they received repeated verbal instructions to keep this information a secret. The former Phoenix Labs developer who joined the company after the acquisition indicated it was considered "confidential information" they were barred from disclosing in the company's standard NDA.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One former senior employee told Game Developer the first they were told of the impending acquisition was in January 2023. A developer who was employed with the studio before the acquisition and was laid off in 2024 said they only learned they'd been acquired after hearing it from their team lead. Another employed for a similar length of time told Game Developer they only learned it had purchased the studio after being laid off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At both Rumble Games and Phoenix Labs, the lack of transparency over Forte's ownership seeped into day-to-day life. Three of the former Phoenix Labs employees we spoke with told Game Developer that updates from Forte were the talk of gossip in meetings, but rarely came with formal announcements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Phoenix Labs workers had slightly more contact with their parent company than workers at Rumble Games. This was in the form of interim CEO Neil Young, a longtime game industry executive who had founded N3twork, a blockchain company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005333/en/Forte-Acquires-N3TWORK%E2%80%99s-Platform-to-Further-Accelerate-Growth-in-Blockchain-Games">bought by Forte</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two veteran developers we spoke with didn't voice any major complaints about Young, with one saying he was "outwardly supportive." But they said he didn't seem to share the creative values of the studio. One of these former employees remembered him saying Phoenix Labs was on track to be "front of market of an age of abundance," apparently in reference to Forte's mission of making blockchain-friendly games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Phoenix Labs and Rumble Games were in different positions regarding how fast they were supposed to be implementing blockchain technology in their games. Developers at Rumble were working on a fully-functional blockchain marketplace that would let players buy and sell in-game items listed using cryptocurrency. The former senior Phoenix Labs developer told us Forte solicited pitches from the studio on how to use blockchain technology in its games, but that it was never "prescriptive" with its approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This individual said they weren’t bothered by "downplaying" the ownership, saying they believed Phoenix Labs would not "do itself any favors" by acknowledging being owned by a crypto-affiliated company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the freer hand, there was still nervousness about any effort to use blockchain in Phoenix Labs' existing games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fae Farm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the planned Early Access game operating under the title "Project Dragon" (a multiplayer sandbox-RPG inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) were both conceived as being partly aimed at younger audiences, and employees were uncomfortable with hawking digital items with speculative value to children and teenagers.</span></p><p>Image via Phoenix Labs.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Life at Phoenix Labs reportedly deteriorated after Young "vanished" from the company in early 2024. At this point, both the newer hire and tenured developers we spoke with said Phoenix Labs felt like it was turned into a series of smaller game studios barely supported by Forte.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Company-wide town halls known as "lab reports" were cancelled. Developers lost visibility on other teams' projects. Morale took a major hit. "We saw less of that message of unity we were used to," one of the veteran workers told us, adding that it seemed the company's core values were "relevant in times [of plenty], but vanished in times of hardship."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forte's spokesperson informed us that the lab reports were ended after "some leadership change." "Processes often shift with leaders," they added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fate of both studios took a turn in early 2024. In March, Forte acquired Rumble Games from Aristocrat Leisure, kicking off four months of tumult where employees didn't understand who was paying them or where their benefits came from. Employees were first told of the purchase in April, when they received notices saying they were "terminated" by Aristocrat, and that Forte was now their owner. The former employee we spoke with said they never signed a new contract or received an employee handbook from Forte.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this acquisition took place, Forte told developers on various in-development games at Phoenix Labs that they were pulling financial support from those projects. Forte told some, like those working on Project Dragon,&nbsp;they could continue development if they secured new funding from outside the company. They had a three-month runway to find a partner. Project Dragon's leads were tasked with seeking out the funding themselves, instead of a business development representative operating on behalf of the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers on Project Dragon were optimistic because the game was in great shape and months away from its Early Access launch. But then Forte changed course, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-cancels-games-studio-fate-unknown">laying the entire team off in mid-May</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, two months before their runway was supposed to run out. Lead developers on Project Dragon convinced Forte to let them continue to pitch the game to publishers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, they seemed close to pulling off a deal—but then Forte shut down the servers hosting builds of the game around August 2024. It seemed to have a "heavy hand" in the whole process, with workers saying Forte wanted blockchain technology to be integrated into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Forte's PR spokesperson told Game Developer that the company is "not currently seeking new partners or funding on paused projects; but Phoenix is currently operating its live games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Employees were given permission to share some of their work on Project Dragon on social media, a rare boon for developers on cancelled games, who often see much of their </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/towers-titans-dev-rumble-games-shut-down-in-ruthless-pursuit-of-profits">work locked away forever behind closed doors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rumble Games developers wouldn't be given the same offer when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/towers-titans-dev-rumble-games-shut-down-in-ruthless-pursuit-of-profits">it was shut down in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a fact that still pains former employees to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer asked Forte's PR spokesperson why it decided to close Rumble Games. "They can't go into detail so as not to pre-empt upcoming strategy and product announcements, but the studio's projects did not ultimately align with the company's direction," they responded.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why is Forte Labs being so secretive?">Why is Forte Labs being so secretive?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The circumstances around Forte Labs' ownership of Phoenix Labs and Rumble Games are highly unusual, especially with the company claiming it had no "formal policy" directing employees to keep the information a secret. All the former Phoenix Labs and Rumble Games employees expressed a range of emotions about the experience, some saying they felt "betrayed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Three of our sources were under the impression that Forte's secrecy had to do with the negative perception of blockchain-based games and a worry that there would be "bad press" if it came out Phoenix Labs was owned by a blockchain company. No one could confirm if that was the motivating reason.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers who applied to positions at these companies weren't allowed to know who they'd be working for. The lack of communication with their parent company left them uncertain about their job security. Some feared that other developers would feel tempted to take Forte's money without knowing how it had run Phoenix Labs and Rumble Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only reason the world knows about Forte's secret transactions is because former principal engineer Kris Morness put himself on the line and named the company in a LinkedIn post announcing his layoff. Other former Phoenix employees said they only felt comfortable coming forward after he took that step, and the former Rumble workers we spoke with said they only learned another studio shared their fate because he spoke out (Morness did not respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn).</span></p><p>Image via LinkedIn.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strange saga of Forte Labs' studio purchases embodies many of the most hardcore capitalistic instincts of the video game industry. Tightfisted secrecy and prioritizing profits over creativity are often criticized as behaviors that hurt quality of life in this business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Video games as an industry needs developers, creatives, and distribution platforms, and all of us have to treat each other fairly for this to work," the former Rumble Games employee said, when asked for their opinion of the experience. They noted it changed their thinking about unionization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it was one of the former Phoenix Labs workers—who worked on one of the games cancelled by Forte—that summed up why developers push through even after painful experiences like this one. They gushed over the talent and creativity of their peers, describing how team members of all disciplines collaborated in a way they hadn't seen on other projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They don't regret the time spent on that unreleased game. "That was still worth doing," they said. They stressed how important it is for developers to remember why they got into this business—to make games that bring joy to players, even when those at the top only seem to prioritize profits.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://rebel-wolves.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebel Wolves</a> is a games studio that was co-founded in 2022 by industry veteran Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the Game Director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Yesterday, they announced that they are entering a strategic partnership with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namco-begins-laying-off-employees-after-cancellation-of-several-titles/">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> Europe. This agreement means that Bandai Namco Entertainment will be responsible for publishing Rebel Wolves' debut title, an action RPG named Dawnwalker. Bandai Namco will be responsible for publishing this title globally, as well as taking on the responsibility for both the retail and digital distribution of the game upon release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Dawnwalker is the first title for Rebel Wolves and is shaping up to be a dark fantasy narrative sandbox, AAA action RPG that takes place in medieval Europe. The game is targeting mature audiences and will be developed utilizing Unreal Engine 5. At the moment, the details regarding the project are minimal, but it's said that the developers will reveal more information about what is to come in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc commented on the partnership between Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment, saying: "Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself. We're looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide."</p>
<p>From the statements made by Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, it seems that this project is shaping up to be highly ambitious, with the promise of future games to tie into their debut release. Alberto Gonzalez Lorca, VP for Business Development at Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, said, "This is another key milestone in our content development strategy for the Western market. By combining our strengths, we will deliver this first game of the studio to a worldwide audience. We're excited with the universe being created by Rebel Wolves thanks to their extremely talented team of developers, resulting in a great addition to our portfolio."</p>
<p>More details about this exciting-sounding title will be released in the coming months, making it a new project for eager fans to keep their eyes on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails&nbsp;</em>developer Nihon Falcom is considering using AI in order to assist with translation for its future games, the studio's CEO has revealed.</p>
<p>In an interview with Japanese gaming platform <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4Gamer</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/trails-series-developer-nihon-falcom-eyes-using-ai-translation-to-shorten-localization-process/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Nihon Falcom head Toshihiro Kondo said that leaving initial translation work to AI could "compress the entire process and ultimately speed up development".</p>
<p>Kondo acknowledges that "human effort would still be needed to make final adjustments to the translated words and lines", but expresses a hope that AI translation could shorten the distance between the Japanese release of a Nihon Falcom game and the Western release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-daybreak-2.jpg?itok=MMvmDGqh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-ai-translation-daybreak-2.jpg?itok=PLyARZxv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Future Nihon Falcom games could be translated by AI before being tweaked by humans.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Kondo says that it's not possible to release&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games simultaneously worldwide due to the amount of text in them, which he says is "several times larger than that of a typical RPG".</p>
<p>According to Kondo, the Nihon Falcom team begins translation work on a&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>game once the Japanese version is complete, which is why Western versions of the games usually "come out a year later at best".</p>
<p>He doesn't acknowledge the possibility of bringing in a translation team to work on a&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>game alongside the Japanese developers, although it's fair to say Nihon Falcom is a relatively small studio, so perhaps this isn't possible for logistical reasons.</p>
<p>In any case, although Kondo doesn't fully commit to using AI in order to translate future&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games, I'd be surprised if we didn't start seeing first-pass translations done by AI on&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>games, with humans touching up the results to make sure they're fit for purpose.</p>

Non-gaming companies deciding to try to grab a slice of the giant pie by spending money to recruit big names often seems to end this way (although Amazon is rather noticeably countering this right now). <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>Game File</em></a></span>, (written by Stephen Totilo, late of this parish), Netflix’s so-called Team Blue has shuttered less than two years after its creation.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Netflix’s attempts to break into video games have been more successful than some, albeit mostly as a result of buying studios already making a game, and then releasing it under its own branding. For instance, buying Night School Studio and releasing <em>Oxenfree II</em>. But given the streamer’s (sensible) focus on mobile gaming, it was a contrary move to have hired some serious industry bigwigs for a larger project.</p><p>In April 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/veteran-halo-destiny-director-joins-netflix-games-1850344778&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/veteran-halo-destiny-director-joins-netflix-games-1850344778">it was announced that Joseph Staten</a></span>—creative director on the <em>Halo</em> franchise, amongst a lot more—was joining Netflix Games to helm “a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP.” He joined other big names at the division run by former EA exec Mike Verdu, like Blizzard producer Chacko Sonny and Sony Santa Monica’s art director on <em>God of War</em>, Rafael Grassetti. This nominal dream team was set to create something completely new, and now it seems likely we’ll see nothing of their work.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-games-hades-dead-cells-gta-1851600876">Netflix Is Making 80 New Games, Added To The 100 You Forgot You Had</a></span></p><p>This is nothing unusual in the games industry. It’s very common for a publisher to hire a big name or two after their significant successes, only to see that person move on a few years later with no new games to their name. Internal projects often fail to make it to an alpha build—a process which can take months or years—and even if no releases come of it, the whole process <em>can</em> be a positive experience. (Usually you can tell when the individual involved leaves to start their own studio, employing a suspiciously large number of former colleagues.) However, when it’s a company that has no real games development experience, it does seem more likely than not to fail. </p><p>Ask anyone from Typhoon Studios, bought by Google just before the release of <em>Journey to the Savage Planet </em>during the search engine’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">ill-fated foray into epic albatross Stadia</a></span>. No, seriously, ask them, because they do not hold back on talking about how badly it went.

That's the entire idea behind Activision's character, The Replacer. As played by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawns-peter-stormare-will-reprise-his-role-in-the-movie/1100-6525489/" data-ref-id="1100-6525489">Until Dawn</a>'s Peter Stormare (and occasionally other performers), The Replacer steps in when people need to play Call of Duty. This past weekend, one of the Replacers actually tagged in for the Los Angeles Rams' mascot during an NFL game.</p><p>There may have been some crossed wires there, as The Replacer with the Rampage mask was confronted by the actual Rampage who serves as the official LA Rams mascot. It was an easy mistake to make! Perhaps he was supposed to show up this Sunday, after the release of Black Ops 6. Then we'll see if Rampage is still feeling put out about his temporary replacement.</p><p>Since sports are one of the few examples of broadcast programming that still command a large audience, video game and movie companies are increasingly coming up with new ways to promote their projects during those events. As an example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smile-2-promo-actor-hilariously-breaks-character-during-baseball-game/1100-6527154/" data-ref-id="1100-6527154">random actors appeared during the MLB playoffs</a> to advertise the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theres-no-escape-in-the-final-trailer-for-smile-2/1100-6527173/" data-ref-id="1100-6527173">Smile 2</a>.</p><p>Stormare officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-brings-back-popular-character-for-black-ops-6-marketing-and-he-pretends-to-be-the-pope/1100-6526771/" data-ref-id="1100-6526771">reprised his role as the original Replacer</a> last month in a very funny ad where he served as a substitute fireman, a family man at dinner, and even the Pope. Unfortunately, since The Replacer isn't real, the rest of us will have to make other arrangements when Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 hits Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 25.

			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver, delivering optimizations for the following games and DLCs launching shortly: Alan Wake 2: The Lake House, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, No More Room In Hell 2, Red Dead Redemption, and The Axis Unseen. The driver also also adds support for 32 additional G-SYNC Compatible displays.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned PC games and more will support NVIDIA DLSS 3, starting with the second Alan Wake 2 DLC, The Lake House, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-new-trailer-confirms-october-22nd-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is out today</a>. Remedy's game actually offers the complete NVIDIA RTX package: DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, path tracing, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Then there's No More Room in Hell 2, which we covered with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 Q&amp;A</a>. The sequel in development at Torn Banner Studios debuts today in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access</a>, already packing support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex.</p>
<p>Last but not least, another game due to launch in a few hours is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Axis Unseen</a>, a 'heavy metal horror game' singlehandedly made by Nate Purkeypile, a 20-year Bethesda veteran who worked on Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield. This indie game also supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. In two days, the strategy/simulation/management game Industry Giant 4.0 will also launch in early access with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, DLAA, and Reflex.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/10-22dlss-pr-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Next week, it will be up to two heavyweights. On October 29, Rockstar Games will finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-is-out-on-october-29-system-requirements-nvidia-dlss-frame-generation-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> the long-awaited PC version of Red Dead Redemption, which will include DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. Two days later, BioWare is set to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, the follow-up to Inquisition (a decade later). The game also supports DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Reflex, and ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion. On the same day, Guerrilla will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> with Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex. Lastly, DLSS Super Resolution was added to Wayfinder yesterday as part of its 1.0 launch.</p>
<p>NVIDIA had one more thing to announce today: a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/star-wars-outlaws-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new GeForce RTX Series 40 bundle</a>&nbsp;dedicated to Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. The bundle will be available at select retailers until November 12.</p>
