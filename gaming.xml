		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has announced that a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> demo will be available to download on November 22nd for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>The free demo will give players their first taste of the reimagined hack and slash series as they take on the role of nameless warrior whose fate in entwined with that of ancient China’s warring Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set during a campaign against the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, players will find themselves thrust into the Battle of Sishui Gate. For those who have been following Dynasty Warriors: Origins since its announcement, this is the same stage that has been shown off during various expos, showcasing many of the game fresh new features as well as some of its most beloved characters. Speaking of which, the Battle of Sishui Gate is where the allied Three Kingdoms first face off against the legendary warrior, Lu Bu, a fight that’s bound to put players through their paces once the training wheels come off.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins will officially launch next year on January 17th, making it one of 2025’s first major releases with pre-orders now live across all available platforms. It’s a soft reset for the series, and while it doesn’t look to be a complete departure from previous games there are some interesting mechanics at play that will hopefully dispel the bad taste left by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors-9">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>.</p>

<p>It has been the best part of a decade since the last numbered instalment which scored a mediocre 5/10 in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 review</a>. We concluded that” Sadly, this isn’t the breakthrough fans were expecting. Omega Force took a pretty big risk with Dynasty Warriors 9, and while its open world integration can be seen as a small triumph, this newest entry is marred by its heavily outdated approach to combat design.”</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to attend a preview event for Origins and will have some first hands-on impressions coming very soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-server-issues.1040679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>is being review bombed on Steam after seemingly launching with extensive server issues, with users pointing to server loops, excessive loading times, and login queues as major issues, as well as problems with the game's cloud asset infrastructure.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Microsoft and developer Asobo Studio released the latest iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, but it's already run into major issues, accruing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an Overwhelmingly Negative rating on Steam</a> across 2,955 reviews (at time of writing).</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues users seem to be pointing out has to do with how&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>loads its assets. Much of the game's asset loading, including for aircraft, liveries, and more, is tied to cloud streaming, and since servers are struggling, that seems to be leading to problems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=m2O1_FPO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-bomb-klm-flight.jpg?itok=xUBK3pyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>players are not happy with how the game has been released.</figcaption></figure><p>One player says they were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199244305024/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stuck on a loading screen "for 65 minutes"</a>, with the screen freezing up at 97% and seemingly refusing to load any further than that.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198192847703/recommended/2537590/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">points out some of the aforementioned issues</a>&nbsp;and says&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>"feels like an alpha build", concluding that it "looks pretty and has potential but needs a lot of work". That's particularly damning for a game with a hefty asking price of $69.99.</p>

<p>The game's developers have said they are aware of the issue, dedicating a developer livestream to the problem earlier today.&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator&nbsp;</em>head Jorg Neumann said the team had "completely underestimated how high" pre-release excitement had been for the game.</p>

<p>Asobo Studio CEO Sebastian Wloch offers a technical explanation for the issues; players are asking&nbsp;<em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers for data, which is then cached in a database, but said cache is "currently getting saturated".</p>




<p>Wloch says the team stress-tested&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s servers during the game's tech alpha, with the team performing load tests "simulating 200,000 users", but he concedes that the game has been "completely overwhelmed".</p>

<p>Community manager Jayne, also known as Jummivana, pledges to keep players updated via social media, and Neumann concludes the stream by apologizing to affected players, acknowledging that many are "frustrated" with the game's issues.</p>

<p>He says that although he knows the development team "had some problems today", the devs are "on it" and attempting to fix&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>'s issues. Unfortunately, though, for now, if you're stuck, it looks like there's no fix yet.</p>

<p>If you want to try your luck, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537590/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2024/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as Xbox Series X|S.

<p>Square Enix and Lightspeed Studios have just announced Final Fantasy 14 Mobile, an adaptation of the popular online MMORPG for Android and iOS devices.&nbsp;The game will first be released as a demo through multiple playtests in China and then launched globally. Interested players can pre-register on the game’s <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will serve as an extension of the popular franchise and a sister game to FFXIV.

<p>Regarding features, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will retain lifestyle content such as fishing, Triple Triad, and Chocobo racing. When it comes to exploration, the world of Eorzea features intricate weather and time-of-day systems that offer over 600 different weather patterns across various landscapes. In terms of customization, player characters and equipment designs have been carefully crafted and optimized to bring the original game’s details to life.</p>

The new Star Wars game has been discounted in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">Black Friday sales</a>, now down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvVeL?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.99 on PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g3l0n?object_uuid=f691f518-3b61-47e9-b5e3-5fb07e34874f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>. That's $20 off the original list price and potentially a much better offering for anyone unsure of the game when it launched back in late August. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal also features Amazon's exclusive limited edition content pack, which includes Rogue Infiltrator cosmetics for Kay and Nix. It's likely the best deal we're getting on the game before Christmas, so snap it up if you've been waiting for a sale, or want to gift it to someone over the holidays.</p><div id="208147" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (PS5)</h3></p></div><div catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f" id="208149"><div id="208149" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (Xbox)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This could be a good time to jump on the game since it's not been long since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-12-starts-road-to-recovery-with-improved-performance-and-large-number-of-fixes">Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment deployed a massive update</a> bringing a host of performance and gameplay enhancements, a range of visual improvements, and bug fixes to the open-world sci-fi game on console and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher laid out everything new in the patch notes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on its website</u></a>, with Ubisoft emphasizing that these updates were shaped by player feedback, reaffirming its commitment to closely listening as post-launch support for Star Wars Outlaws continues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What We Said In Our Review</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">IGN reviewer Tristan Ogilvie said is his review</a>: "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A clever syndicate system brings real weight to almost every task you choose to undertake, some of which have creative quest designs that can often conjure up some genuinely stunning blindsides. Having a pal like Nix at your side the entire time not only adds an extra dimension to Kay’s fairly generic smuggler character, but also gives her an enhanced set of useful abilities. But even he can’t quite make its stealth and combat feel any less rigid and repetitive, and the odds of avoiding the many glaring technical issues present at launch are 3,720 to one. But you probably didn’t want me to tell you the odds."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off. Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as this new discount on Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

"In this sense, personally, I’d like to try to make a new Dragon Engine specialized for high-spec consoles, and with it, to develop a new action-adventure game. This is just what I personally feel, so it has nothing to do with the studio’s actual plans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito obviously has some influence as technical director of RGG Studio but it's unclear if fans' hopes for an upgraded engine will emerge anytime soon. The Dragon Engine has so far been used to create Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza Kiwami 2, First of the North Star: Lost Paradise, Judgement, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgement, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">the upcoming Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio is known for its prompt releases, and this list is somehow just a fraction of its overall output as in the same time it's also released Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 Remastered, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD, Judgement Remastered, Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania, and Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But releasing so many games has some drawbacks, as while each Yakuza game has reviewed well, fans have complained about animations and assets that get reused over multiple entries. It's for reasons such as these that fans are eager for a new engine, not to mention the technological leap that would potentially come with leaving the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito added to this somewhat, saying that while RGG Studio has found ways to squeeze more life out of the Dragon Engine with each entry, it's also being held back by keeping its games on the previous console generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We would like to avoid limiting ourselves because of performance as much as possible, but not everyone plays the Like a Dragon series on higher-end consoles, so we would like to figure out a future plan on this at some point," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This again stops short of confirming a new engine being in development at RGG Studio, and as mentioned it's already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">revealed its next game as Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> as another Dragon Engine entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just a spin-off, however, leaving fans with a little hope that the next mainline game, Like a Dragon 9, will perhaps make that technological jump. RGG Studio head <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-dragon-engine-unreal-engine-5-masayoshi-yokoyama">Masayoshi Yokoyama even said in 2022 that the Dragon Engine is "a bit old."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Even those who do manage to load into the game are having problems, with players reporting missing content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://youtu.be/kuMd7udCyFM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video message to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024’s disgruntled community</a>, Jorg Neumann, Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Sebastian Wloch, Asobo CEO and co-founder, explained why the launch had gone so badly wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neumann began the video with an admission: “We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frankly we completely underestimated how high [excitement was] and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wloch then proceeded to go into more detail, revealing that even simulating 200,000 concurrent players during pre-release load tests failed to prevent the launch from causing catastrophic server problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've been struggling for a few hours with one of our services,” Wloch explained. “In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim. People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asobo's initial attempt to fix the problems showed promise, but eventually buckled as this cache collapsed once again. “We've tried to restart the services,” Wloch said. “We've taken measures to throttle the number of people who can come in at the same time. At some point it worked pretty well, so we increased the queue speed by 5x. And it worked well for maybe half an hour or so and then all of a sudden the cache collapsed again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we're restarting, we're trying to investigate, doing our best and going as fast as we can to make sure everybody can go in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why are Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 players enduring this eternal loading? And why, when players do manage to get into the game, are they seeing content they shouldn't or not displayed properly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The issue that causes this is pretty much, when that service fails it restarts, it retries, it retries,” Wloch said. “First of all, that creates extremely long initial loading, which is not supposed to be as long. And after a certain time it will fail. If the missing data is blocking, you will not finish the loading — stop at 97% — and get a message. That means you need to restart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if the content was not completely blocking you may enter the sim and then maybe there's a few planes missing, maybe there's some content missing, and that's all due to the same problem with that server and service.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Asobo fixes this problem as soon as possible; Wloch said that once the server issues are sorted out players shouldn’t see the queue screen they’re currently experiencing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While it’s a great launch day, we know a lot of people are frustrated,” Neumann concluded. “We're really sorry. We want to apologize. We have some problems today. The team is on it, and we will keep going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>A second hotfix will be released for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> tomorrow, 21st November, bringing a number of fixes.</p>
<p>What's more, developer Frontier has detailed what it's working on for the December update to bring a number of enhancements.</p>
<p>One of the main changes to the theme park sim in the November update is to make flumes more enticing for park guests: now, guests will be less likely to change their mind on their way to a flume, more likely to ride a flume multiple times, and will find pools less desirable, entering instead via a flume.</p>

<p>Further, guests will now tolerate longer queues "within reason" and queue times will be displayed more accurately. Full hotfix notes are available on the <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/news/2024-11-21/hot-fix-2">Planet Coaster 2 website</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are especially welcome considering water rides are the big new feature in this sequel, so now guests will be more likely to make a splash.</p>
<p>As for December, there are firstly a number of confirmed additions. These include multiple UI enhancements like edge scrolling on PC and adjusted colourblind friendly heat maps, as well as control adjustments, the removal of the game's logo from paths, an increased number of Workshop items displayed in the browser per page, and tweaks to staff and maintenance.</p><p>There are more additions being worked on by Frontier, though these aren't confirmed for December. These include improvements to flume physics, the ability to reset objects back to their default colour, tweaked condition penalties for power generators, and a removal of the Workshop download limit on PC.</p>
<p>Lastly, the December update will bring general stability and performance fixes, as well as coaster bug fixes.</p>
<p>Frontier's theme park sim sequel released at the start of the month, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-officially-announces-planet-coaster-2-now-with-water-parks">reveal back in July</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, it was reported Frontier has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f1-manager-25-reportedly-cancelled-by-planet-coaster-studio">cancelled its forthcoming F1 Manager 25 game</a> due to poor sales of the franchise. It appears the studio is returning to the sim games it's best known for, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> included.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-added-in-latest-beta-update.1040625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a PlayStation Portal update that introduces cloud streaming to the device, allowing you to stream over 100 PS5 games to your Portal, but there's a catch, as you might expect.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, cloud streaming will only be available for PlayStation Plus Premium members. That's right; you won't even be able to take advantage of this feature if you're signed up to PlayStation Plus Extra.</p>

<p>If you do happen to be a Premium member, however, you'll gain access to cloud streaming for "over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog", including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dave-diver" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-rise" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart" rel="nofollow"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>, among many others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=FTRXyhP9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=oooDm3IT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PlayStation Portal can now stream certain PS5 games via the cloud, but you'll need a PS Plus membership.</figcaption></figure><p>Games will stream at up to 1080p resolution and 60fps on the PlayStation Portal, and you'll also be able to access DualSense features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, as well as the touchpad, which will be emulated via the Portal's touchscreen.</p>

<p>Naturally, cloud storage will also be accessible on the Portal, so you'll be able to access any save files you've got on the cloud for the PS5 games the Portal supports.</p>

<p>In order to access this update, you'll need a PS Plus Premium membership, as well as access to the internet and "minimum 5Mbps of upload and download speeds". That number increases to 7Mbps for 720p and 13Mbps for 1080p.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Portal won't support streaming PS4 or PS3 games, and it also won't support features like party voice chat, 3D audio, or Game Trials.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=z7LQ69iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=7khsLMgq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales&nbsp;</em>and many other PS5 games can now be streamed via your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the PlayStation Portal, it's a rather curious handheld device that is designed to be used with a PS5 console.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional handhelds, the Portal <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">doesn't support games of its own</a>; rather, it streams games from a linked PS5, allowing you to enjoy PS5 games without needing to hook the console up to your TV (although you will need to do that to complete the initial setup).</p>

<p>As such, it's not a true successor to the likes of the PSP or the ill-fated PS Vita, although this latest update arguably puts the Portal one step closer to being the device it always should have been. The new update started rolling out yesterday, so if it hasn't been released where you live yet, it should arrive soon.</p>

            <p>Did last week's paranormal body-swapper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a> leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ram-random-access-mayhem">RAM: Random Access Mayhem</a>, out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256450/RAM_Random_Access_Mayhem/">Steam early access</a>, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.</p>
<p>Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-dawn">Nuclear Dawn</a> meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ctrl-alt-ego">Ctrl Alt Ego</a>, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.</p><!--more-->

<p>Those robot bodies, then. They range from cheery grenade-throwing dustbins on wheels to punchy gladiators equipped with a grapple. You'll switch between by aiming the cursor and pressing space, but you'll need energy to do so, and energy is, of course, obtained by killing.</p><p>Early-game gambits include teleporting into the head of the robot behind an attacking horde and shooting all the others all in the back. Beyond that, you'll want to possess bots that are strong against the types in play. It feels like there's decent variety: each bot has a primary and a secondary attack, and you can customise them with collectible upgrade sticks, picking from three techs each time. You'll get more of those upgrades if you pull off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a>-esque trickshots such as punching one robot into another or using your flamethrower to propel yourself around like a battering ram. I mean, a battering RAM. See, I can do dad jokes too. </p>
<p>"Cor, this top-down roguelike shooter is quite something, lemme tell ya," a jovial Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/15-steam-next-fest-demos-you-should-play-first-this-february">wrote in February</a>. "With its twinstick controls and bevy of robot opponents to mow down, this is a fast-paced action game that doesn't pull any punches."</p>
<p>The devs estimate that RAM's early access period will "last around a year, depending on how the feedback around the game develops, with large updates every 3-4 months." The current early access version offers six robots, two stages, daily challenge runs and minigames in a hub area, together with the beginning of the story. The final version will have a complete storyline, an expanded endgame difficulty modifier system, more stages and more bots.</p>
<p>To return to Slitterhead briefly - I keep seeing this described as a game we will one day call a cult classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review">Ed Thorn's review</a> strongly suggests otherwise. If you've played, how are you finding it?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is out now, and a senior developer on the project has said the game needed to embrace machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to come to market. Jorg Neumann said in an interview that it would not have been possible to create the game's map data "by hand."</p><p>"We would have spent our entire lives and then some just marking up terrain, which is not really the core of the thing. So it's just a tool that helps us," he told <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-machine-learning-ai-and-how-much-of-your-data-it-might-need" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> of machine learning and AI.</p><p>One major fear is that advancements to machine learning and AI will lead to job losses, but for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, this was not the case. "The only thing we've done is grow," Neumann said.</p><p>A team of 100 people made 2020's Microsoft Flight Simulator. For this new release, 200 people at Asobo worked on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with another 600 people at support studios for a total of 800 people working on the game.</p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 uses machine learning to generate terrain detail. The team marked up around 28,000 "tiles" that were representative of Earth--these included textures meant to replicate the forests, deserts, rivers, and so on. This data was then fed into a machine learning platform that creates a potential asset, which is then reviewed by a human, and then the system is re-trained.</p><p>"You basically say: 'Oh, OK, got this wrong.' And then you retrain it. We did that in four different stages," Neumann said.</p><p>Before this, EA Sports management said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">wouldn't have been possible to release EA Sports College Football 25 on time and up to quality</a> without the use of machine learning and AI to generate all manner of assets.

Staff members who worked on Unknown 9: Awakening report layoffs across the team at Canadian outfit Reflector Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Jobs lost include roles within Reflector's art, marketing, narrative and quality assurance (QA) teams, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-reflector-entertainment-cuts-jobs-after-launching-debut-title-unknown-9">Game Developer</a> reported. 
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening launched last month to mixed reviews. On Steam, where it sits with a Mixed rating, less than 100 players have rated the game.

<p>
Published by Bandai Namco, Unknown 9: Awakening felt like an attempt to recapture the sci-fi adventure of Assassin's Creed, in a modern Tomb Raider-style globe-trotting story that featured secret societies vying over the remnants of an ancient civilisation. 
</p>
<p>First announced in 2020, the project drew interest due to its intriguing debut trailer featuring a younger version of protagonist Haroona (played in the final game by Anya Chalotra, AKA Yennefer in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s The Witcher). It was the first project from the Montreal-based Reflector, co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> creative director Alexandre Amancio. </p><p>
The game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">meant to act as a central point for the franchise as a cross-media brand</a>. Just this week, a second season of the Unknown 9: Out of Sight tie-in podcast was launched, while the fourth issue of its graphic novel series Unknown 9: Torment arrived. There's also a web series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-juTgG_tIEeJ4DSnPrGAUMYAK9o-JW9H">Unknown 9: Passage</a>, which you can go watch on YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, I was affected by the layoffs at Reflector Entertainment, which means I'm currently looking for a job as a Narrative Designer or Game Writer. If you hear of any opportunities, please let me know," one staff member who lost their job wrote.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/sony-announce-black-friday-playstation-deals-starting-friday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> 2024 sale will start on 22nd November and run until 2nd December, with the pretty familiar spread of offers across games, hardware and accessories, whether you’re buying direct from PlayStation or with participating retailers.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important part of this is the huge sale that will sweep onto the PlayStation Store for digital <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PS4 games. Sony highlight that this will include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>… and they’ll probably match the prices seen in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/xbox-black-friday-sale-cuts-50-off-xbox-series-xs-consoles-discounts-over-1000-games/">Xbox Black Friday sale</a> that’s already underway.</p>


<p>Second most important for existing PS5 gamers is the annual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> subscription discount. From 22nd November you’ll be able to save up to 30% across a 12-month membership. Existing subscribers can also save 25% when upgrading from Essential to Extra, or 30% when going from Extra to Premium/Deluxe – Premium members will now get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">cloud gaming for PS Portal</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re after some new hardware, then you can look to PlayStation Direct, or your chosen retailer for discounts across PS5 consoles, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR2</a>, games, and PS5 accessories including DualSense wireless controllers, Pulse Elite wireless headset, Pulse Explore wireless earbuds. They’re also launching a special PS5 Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle. These will take the form of an MSRP drop, but retailers are always able to compete and create their own bundles from it.</p>
<p>What will those discounts be? Sony ain’t saying just yet… but we do have the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-des-remises-interessantes-attendues-sur-les-consoles-ps5-chez-plusieurs-marchands-59662">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They claim that following PS5 and PSVR 2 discounts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Standard Edition</strong>: €474.99 instead of €549.99.</li>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Digital Edition</strong>: €374.99 instead of €449.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 headset</strong>: €399.99 instead of €599.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 <a title="Games > Horizon Call of the Mountain [30 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/horizon-call-of-the-mountain/">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> Pack:</strong> (contains the PS VR2 headset + Horizon Call of the Mountain game activation code): €399.99 instead of €649.99.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a huge up to €250 off a PSVR 2! And a more sensible €75 off on PS5 Slims.</p>

						<h5>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h5><p><span>November 20, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series S|X</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Yes, I've played STALKER 2's final version. It's real, and yet it feels surreal to write this review after all the problems this project has gone through across more than a decade. This could have easily gone the way of Duke Nukem Forever, and I'm glad it didn't.</p>
<p>We first <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> the name STALKER 2 fourteen years ago, just a few months after the launch of Call of Pripyat. GSC Game World founder and CEO Sergiy Grygorovych commented that the franchise's four million sales more than warranted a proper sequel, which the developer estimated to be coming in 2012. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian team faced financial hardships and had to be dissolved in late 2011. At that point, everyone thought STALKER 2 would never be made, but the team was put back together three years later.</p>
<p>GSC Game World's first order of business was releasing a new entry in their real-time strategy series Cossacks, but their true objective was to make the next STALKER title. The second announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in 2018, with a tentative release window set for 2021. Of course, game development is complicated, and the studio was never particularly famous for its punctuality. As such, there were two entirely unsurprising delays to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a> 2022 and then to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a> 2022, with a bonus NFT-based controversy (the idea was quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-wont-have-blockchain-nfts-anymore-after-massive-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set aside</a> following the community's massive backlash) spruced in the middle for good measure.</p>
<p>The real problems were yet to begin, though. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, GSC Game World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to stop working on STALKER 2 for a few months before <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-developer-gsc-game-world-moving-ukraine-prague/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocating</a> to Prague. Still, even after that, the impact of the nearby war inevitably slowed the Ukrainian developers. There were also more incidents, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-studio-gsc-game-world-hacked-russian-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberattack</a> from Russian hackers and&nbsp;an office fire <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-suffers-office-fire-due-to-electrical-installation-malfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> by an electrical malfunction. Still, the team persevered throughout this veritable ordeal, and we can now play the game at long last. Is it any good, though? I would say mostly, with some fairly sizable caveats.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stalker-2-screenshots.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the STALKER series, the first thing to understand is that this is not your average shooter game. The protagonist of this sequel, Skif, is not some sort of superhero or even an incredibly hardened veteran soldier. He's just another stalker who had happily returned to the Mainland from the Zone but is forced to go back to the irradiated Chornobyl area after an anomaly inexplicably destroys his home.</p>
<p>In gameplay terms, this means you'll not be murdering foes left and right with incredible ease and a nearly infinite amount of ammunition at your disposal. Quite the contrary. It could be said that STALKER is the Soulslike of shooters, although the original game predates Demon's Souls by two years, making such a definition incorrect from a chronological standpoint. Even so, it gets the point across: you're going to have a hard time in this game compared to most single player shooters.</p>
<p>There's tons of things that can kill you in the Zone, such as various mutated monsters and humanoids, bandits and enemy stalkers, several anomalies scattered throughout the map, intense radiation pockets, mere fall damage from a sufficient height, and more. To give even more credit to the Souls comparison, GSC Game World actually included an actual death count on the game over screen, as you can see below. I swear most of mine were probably caused by dog and rat packs, which are arguably the most dangerous enemies in this game due to their erratic movement patterns that make them difficult to shoot at.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike FromSoftware, the studio behind this game added three difficulty settings to make the experience more accessible. While I play most games, including shooters, at least on Hard settings, here I had to switch to Rookie (the lowest available) after a little while due to sheer frustration. I mentioned that the game is difficult, but it's not just because of the sheer challenge provided by the AI. There's also the whole injury system and the stamina-based inventory system that add layers of complexity, perhaps too much.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-2-Heart-of-Chornobyl-Game-Over-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</p>
<p>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</p>
<p>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, it might be helpful to allow players to wait time everywhere, even at the peril of hostile encounters. This is because the day/night cycle is slower than most open-world games, and at nighttime, it is sometimes nearly impossible to find things in certain quests. In one instance, I had to leave the game running while I waited for the sun to rise.</p>

<p>Speaking of gunplay, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is solid in this area, although not quite the best in the business. I noticed that weapon sounds do not always seem to play properly, sometimes giving a muffled sound to the bullets that was inappropriate for the weapon. A proper sound is critical to enjoying firing a gun, but it may have been a bug, so I won't dwell on this too much.</p>
<p>The game offers a leaning feature to poke around angles when in cover. You better use it with care, as it doesn't take long to die from gunshots, especially if you're playing on Medium or High difficulty, and the same is generally true for your foes. There's not a great amount of weapons, although that's understandable given the lore - there wouldn't be that many choices in the Zone. You can improve them with several attachments, though they're not that much of a common find.</p>
<p>As with everything, they require maintenance; a nearly-broken weapon could very well jam at the wrong time, leaving you at the mercy of your enemies. I did appreciate that being on the receiving end of a grenade not only damages Skif but also stuns him for a couple of seconds due to the explosion. Overall, the most interesting fights are those against other humans, as that's where the AI really shines, while encounters with mutants and especially animals may be more annoying than anything.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STALKER-2-Sunset-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best part of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is easily the Zone and its exploration. The developers referred to the world as its own character in the review guide, and they were not wrong. All the design choices—even those that I consider currently unbalanced—certainly contribute to the feeling of the Zone as a huge, hostile, and hauntingly beautiful environment that players can explore without loadings from the get-go. But the atmosphere is also perfectly nailed down from both a visual and audio standpoint, providing maximum immersion in this post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
<p>Epic's Unreal Engine 5 renders the Zone with excellent fidelity, and Lumen doesn't disappoint even without the hardware ray tracing option that might be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> post-launch. I did notice a little pop-in on the trees occasionally, probably because GSC did not use Nanite-powered trees, but it wasn't too distracting anyway. On the other hand, the repetitive visual appearance of most NPCs is a little distracting; the developers could have definitely done a better job in this regard, as in some cases you're left wondering if they're all genetically related.</p>
<p>Overall, performance was acceptable on my rig (7800X3D, RTX 4090) when playing at 4K, max settings, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution set to Balanced, and Frame Generation turned on (by the way, all upscalers are supported, including AMD FSR FG). There were a few stutters here and there, but compared to most of the UE games we've seen recently, it wasn't too problematic.</p>
<p>I did not have enough time to complete a full playthrough of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. That's partly because GSC only shared review codes a week ago for a game that lasts an average of 35 to 40 hours and partly because I encountered many bugs that slowed down my playthrough, even blocking progress to the main quest. Yes, this sequel is buggy, too. Perhaps not like the original, but not too far off, at least for the time being. GSC says they've fixed 1125 issues since sharing the review build, including the critical path bug that got me stuck for a couple of days. Still, it will clearly be an ongoing project for them post-launch for quite a while, which is not unexpected for such a big open-world game.</p>
<p>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-will-definitely-find-its-fanbase-in-survival-gamers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been a long time coming for <em>STALKER</em>, as a franchise we haven't had a new title since 2009, but with the release of <em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> players get to return to The Zone and attempt to survive against a variety of factions, strange creatures, and even odder anomalies.</p>

<p>In <em>STALKER 2</em> you take on the role of Skif, a stalker who has headed into the zone to gather more information on a strange Artifact that appeared in his kitchen. Once inside a key piece of equipment is stolen from you and you're left for dead. From there, you begin your quest to track down just who ambushed you and how you can recover your scanner.</p>

<h2><em>STALKER 2</em> reminds me of <em>New Vegas</em>, for better or worse</h2>

<p>The setup reminded me heavily of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6685d7d-626b-40a4-8641-face640c606d" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, with just a brief introduction to the post-apocalyptic world before you're out on your ass with a major MacGuffin to hunt after. While you can tell there's a drive for Skif to recover what he's lost, as a player with very little connection to this world that kind of motivation is a bit difficult to relate to though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=M5NlH9pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=7Se-zmmO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Early on following the scent of your attackers, you'll run into others who brave The Zone, each able to drip-feed you a bit of information to get you to your next location. The overall quest structure of the game did feel a bit like a goose chase.</p>

<p>Each new lead you obtain would get you to someone who knows just a little bit more information, but you need to help them clear out a settlement or recover an important item before they share it with you. In that way, you'll find yourself bouncing around the world doing odd jobs working towards your goal.</p>

<p>The shallow nature of the primary story definitely made the start of the game slow and difficult to get into. Many quests feel like checking boxes rather than something I would really be pushing myself to explore or complete on my own. There's a lot more to <em>STALKER 2</em> than the story though.</p>

<p>If you do make it past the initial 8-10 hours then the story does bring in more ideas and concepts from the original games. You'll see what has happened to the Monolithians, among other factions, and even take steps to align yourself with them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=pxCk61jI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=KFKr-vZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoyment from exploration, not plot</h2>

<p>Each new area is filled with different side-quests and activities. There are a variety of settlements that you can travel to that can be looted or are populated with others who need some help. You can even stumble into turf wars that you can watch from a distance or hop into the fray yourself.</p>

<p>These side-quests aren't just a chance to explore the world as they're also one of the best ways to obtain very necessary equipment whether it be currency for purchasing new items or repairing your gear, or more powerful weapons and armor.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=r0IbuKh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=EaMgaIE7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Survival mechanics will make or break your experience</h2>

<p>The Survival mechanics of <em>STALKER 2</em> is really what will decide if this is the game for you. Jumping into the game you'll immediately notice features that other games offer, like detecting the rough direction of where you're being shot from or a map-based fast travel aren't present.</p>

<p>These survival features continue to add as you play further. You'll be avoiding radiated areas for fear of getting sick, be reminded to eat food continuously, and see some extremely debilitating effects if you start to push your carrying capacity.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=to6XBTHh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=ZKXsaGB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The combination of carrying capacity limits alongside the lack of fast travel unfortunately is a slog. Going out with equipment, bullets, health and food items, and only three guns I'd regularly find myself at 45-50kg of the 80kg carrying capacity. Carrying much more and suddenly my speed is down to a crawl and my stamina drains faster and recharges slower.</p>

<p>From an on-paper perspective, I can see how this promotes the idea of going 'light' or making returning to a base with a variety of valuable items a more stressful situation. Unfortunately outside of settlements, there's very little else to run into in the overworld. What this results in is a lot of dead time just slowly walking across the map.</p>

<h2><em>STALKER 2</em> will find it's audience</h2>

<p>Chances are if you played the original <em>STALKER</em> you've got some idea of what you're in for but if not imagine a mix between a Fallout and Metro game, with a large open world and more intense survival mechanics. If that is something that you're attracted to then now is your time to hop on. If that doesn't take your fancy then you'll likely not reach a point where the story picks up.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-officially-revealed-launching-in-china-first.1040565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em><em>Mobile</em>, a mobile adaptation of the critically-acclaimed MMORPG that's set to launch in China before being released around the world.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=8ed7df04-8e80-47dc-a6be-3339dc3faaf8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the game will capture "the immersive experience of the original title in a fresh, mobile-friendly format", so it won't be a direct port; rather, it will be a slightly reimagined version that presumably takes the mobile environment into account.</p>

<p>No release date has been given, but&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will launch in China first, followed by "a global release soon after". That makes a certain degree of sense given that the developer is a subsidiary of a major Chinese company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=n1mdPgTK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=8-Z43Qtq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will serve as an adaptation of the popular MMORPG for mobile devices.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems the studio handling development on&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>won't be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">Hideaki Itsuno's LightSpeed Studio Japan</a>, but the core LightSpeed team, which makes sense given Itsuno's desire to focus on action games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an introduction</a> to&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, Square Enix and LightSpeed promise "controls optimized for mobile devices", a "variety of playable races", and nine jobs for the game's launch, with more presumably to be added over time.</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida says the mobile version of the game will feature both combat and non-combat jobs, describing&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>as "a sister" to the main game that will aim to "recreate the grandeur of the original's story and combat mechanics" in mobile form.</p>




<p>Side activities like fishing, chocobo racing, and Triple Triad will also be available in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, as will the game's "signature social experience" and "unique, welcoming social atmosphere".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be available, but the game will be undergoing "multiple play tests in China" first, and a global launch will follow "soon after".</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to be getting the mobile RPG treatment from Tencent soon. Recently, Capcom and the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, an open-world survival RPG developed by Tencent and published by Capcom.</p>

<p>It's not just Tencent, either. Bungie and NetEase, another massive Chinese gaming company, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow">recently announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, a mobile spinoff of popular FPS-MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>. The mobile market is lucrative, after all, so all of these spinoffs and adaptations make a lot of sense.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl-is-a-glorious-and-beautiful-pain-in-the-ass.1040562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300652/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There’s a particular feeling when you’re wandering alone in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>. Perhaps you’re squelching through wet, misty marshland, flanked by gigantic reeds. A dark purple sky of unbroken cloud takes up half of the screen; gigantic rusty machinery creates an odd and unnerving silhouette. You hear gunfire in the distance. The sound moves closer, followed by the unmistakable groans of a mutated beast. The sensation sharpens of being pitted against a wilderness that doesn’t care whether you live or die. This is not an unpleasant type of survival. To call the Zone home is to feel an almost elemental sense of freedom: a fantasy of existing purely in the moment, putting one foot in front of the other.&nbsp;</p><p>You had better like walking because in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, the absorbing and currently buggy sequel to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-importance-of-s-t-a-l-k-e-r">trailblazing</a> trilogy of shooters from the 2000s, you do a lot of it. The map, based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22403796/stalker-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-tourists">real-world exclusion zone</a> created in the wake of the 1986 nuclear disaster, is 64 kilometers squared. Objectives tend to be found in derelict buildings dotted about the hostile terrain. You set out on another long trek (hopefully with a functioning gas mask), clasping a metal bolt alongside your rifle. It’s wise to toss the bolt in front of you regularly to test for anomalies: some cause the air itself to warp and bend; others make tiny shards of skin-shredding glass to hover in the atmosphere. Coming into contact with any of them can prove swiftly fatal.</p><p>This version of the Zone is a glorious and beautiful pain in the ass, able to hold its own with other Zones littered throughout pop culture: the restricted site found in Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 movie <a href="https://youtu.be/YuOnfQd-aTw"><em>Stalker</em></a> or Area X in Jeff VanderMeer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275853/jeff-vandermeer-interview-absolution-area-x-southern-reach">Southern Reach</a> novels. It’s thrilling to see Ukrainian studio GSC Game World depict its native landscape so evocatively and in a way that runs counter to much of the prevailing wisdom about how an open-world video game should look and function.</p><p>In <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, the Zone is conspicuously horizontal. Forget about “<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/see-those-mountains">see that mountain</a>”; when you do get a good view, all you see is a shimmering expanse of bog and grassland. The color palette is notably muted: a smudge of murky browns, queasy greens, and charcoal blues — rich, earthy, sometimes squalid. The Zone’s inhabitants are almost all depressed men swilling energy drinks. Have they come to this extreme environment because they are in flight from something at home? Or because the environment mirrors some hidden part of their own psychological makeup?</p><p>For Skif, our spiky protagonist, the answer turns out to be both. His home outside the Zone is set ablaze by a rogue anomaly. He enters looking for answers before getting embroiled in a plot to seize a valuable piece of tech. From there, the narrative branches. You’re free to chum up with various factions like a professionalized military group called the Ward or a band of metaphysical dreamers led by a guy called Scar. But I quickly lost track of who I was in cahoots with and who I wronged. The tangled web of motivations, grudges, and backstories was often inscrutable. Like Tarkovsky’s <em>Stalker </em>or <em>Annihilation</em>, the quest here felt slippery and ever-changing, so I simply stalked toward my quest marker with the score of evocatively discordant synths swirling in my ears.</p><p>The first few hours are punishing. Without much cash, you scavenge damaged weapons prone to jamming. In time, and with a gradually expanding arsenal of exactingly rendered weaponry, the game softens. The kind of emergent, AI-driven moments that made the original<em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> franchise a cult classic also begin to materialize from the metaphysical ether. At one point, I agreed to flush out some mutants from a building for a pair of fellow stalkers. As I was doing so, a rival group opened fire on us, all while a pack of rabid dogs ravaged both parties. The ensuing three minutes were bloody, chaotic, and quite brilliant. At another moment, I led a group of enemy stalkers back to the base of a faction that lives on a gigantic, irradiated trash heap. As my enemies neared the perimeter, guards assumed their defensive positions and unleashed fire in one seamless, dazzlingly orchestrated concert.&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> doesn’t just replicate the achievements of its forebears. The open world furthers the moody, proto-walking sim elements of the originals. Because this Zone is so large, preparation is even more key than in previous games. This occurs alongside a tapestry of navigation, combat, resource management, and crucially, rest, all set against a day-night cycle that genuinely affects gameplay. During especially long stretches of walking, there is much space to contemplate your own actions. In my own case, why did I feel compelled to ruthlessly murder nearly every major NPC despite being on otherwise good terms with them? The Zone has a habit of remaking anything that comes into contact with it, and I fast transformed into another of its monsters.</p><p>When <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 </em>works as intended, it’s an emergent sandbox capable of producing simultaneously bleak and hilarious moments, all while giving the illusion of a world functioning independently of the player’s inputs. But perhaps inevitably because of the game’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">troubled development</a> — which saw over half of the development team move to Prague from Kyiv because of the Russia-Ukraine war — there is some unevenness.</p><p>The biggest issue is combat. While gunplay is crisp and responsive, enemies frequently look in the wrong direction to the threat that they should be facing. Stranger is the way that some human foes (not the mutants that actually possess the ability to become invisible) miraculously appear out of thin air. Another odd glitch saw a character’s head become detached from their body during a cutscene. The following gunfight had a farcical quality. Should I be aiming where the head is hovering or where it should be? These moments, which appear too frequently to be waved away, dispel the Zone’s otherwise convincing illusion.&nbsp;</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> has arrived in a manner that feels tantalizing close to greatness. About 10 hours into the game, the wide-eyed poetic outsider, Scar, lays out his take on the Zone. There is a “dark” side, which has the capacity to strip humans of their free will, and there is the “shining” side — the wondrous, miraculous aspect of this changed place that casts the very essence of life in a new light. “We want the shining Zone to reveal itself,” says Scar longingly.&nbsp;</p><p>With a few patches, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> may yet become this “shining” version of itself. As it stands, the game requires you to submit to the spell that is being cast. The rewards for those who can overlook the wonky combat, bodies that glitch through scenery, and other audio-visual quirks are considerable. That core feeling of raw survival in an uncaring environment — lightning cracking in the distance, rain lashing down, and the disquieting noise of far-off gunfire — never wanes.</p><p><small>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl <em>launches on November 20th on Xbox and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>STALKER 2 is a beautiful game, there’s no doubt about it. It’s hard to imagine a post-apocalyptic wasteland looking good, but here we are – and it does. One of the first questions on the minds of fans worldwide is whether STALKER 2 has a photomode, as it’s not something that has been explicitly confirmed by GSC Game World.</p>



<p>Does STALKER 2 have a photomode? And if it doesn’t, what can you do as an alternative?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>

<p>STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode yet, but it could be added further down the line. This Unreal Engine-powered game looks phenomenal on the surface, and it has so much potential for a photomode, but it hasn’t been added by GSC Game World for the game’s launch.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that you’re out of luck when it comes to taking pictures like this in STALKER 2:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s easy to take first-person perspective shots in STALKER 2 and have them look amazing. That’s mostly because the game looks fantastic, but there’s one option you can quickly tweak to secure brilliant shots without a photomode in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Head into the settings menu and select the UI tab, then scroll to the bottom and drag ‘HUD opacity settings’ to 0%. By doing this, you’ll remove the HUD entirely, presenting yourself with a clean, untarnished image of the game.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that this won’t remove subtitles or character tags, so if you’re looking at someone or talking to them, you’ll have text on the screen.</p>



<p>As STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode, this is the best you can do to take great screenshots without worrying about on-screen clutter.</p>



<p>Don’t worry – it’s the number one thing suggested by the community, so it shouldn’t be too long until a photomode is added.</p>

<p>There’s a new contender in the Game of the Year debate, and it’s called STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. I was fortunate to pour <strong>many </strong>hours into STALKER 2 before it hit the shelves. During my time with the game, I came to be immersed in a gorgeous and harrowing open-world environment that pulled me in harder than a gravitational anomaly.</p>



<p>In a line, STALKER 2 is nothing short of phenomenal, and every minute I spent exploring The Zone made me thankful that GSC Game World never gave up on this project over the ten-plus years<strong> </strong>it took to piece it together. It’s technically impressive and deeply authentic, and it’s guaranteed to hit you like a hearty dose of radiation.</p>



<p>It’s finally here, and my STALKER 2 review will tell you everything you need to know about this game.</p>

<h2 id="h-enter-the-zone">Enter The Zone</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m sorry to say that I never played a STALKER game to any decent length before I picked up STALKER 2. However, I’m a huge fan of games like Fallout, Metro, and Escape from Tarkov, so the base concept of STALKER fits nicely within my wheelhouse.</p>



<p>That meant that I had almost no expectations going in, but from what I’ve come to experience in The Zone, I get the impression that it’s an authentic and remarkable representation of the series thus far. I’m not dim – I know what STALKER is and I’ve long heard about the game’s elements, factions, story, and mutants, and so much of STALKER 2 was at the least <strong>recognisable </strong>for me.</p>



<p>Even I was able to spot Rookie Village in Cordon when I came across it later in the game.</p>



<p>From the moment I was plunged into The Zone, I was marvelling at STALKER 2’s visuals. The transition to Unreal Engine has paid off nicely, and everything from the game’s foliage to the small details littered around building interiors is intricate and – most importantly – <em>realistic</em>.</p>



<p>I constantly found myself wandering across the <strong>enormous </strong>open world just taking in the ambience. The game’s sound engine and weather systems are second to none, and from the birds singing in the trees of a windswept forest to the booming power of a lightning strike landing mere feet from me amid a screaming storm, everything kept me in awe as I played STALKER 2.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, the game’s audio is impeccable. For instance, I stood next to a truck while it was raining, and the sound of drops landing on a rusted metal surface was so accurate, that I had no choice but to marvel at it. I moved through an old, decrepit compound and my feet brushed glass bottles across the floor, and with a surround-sound headset, it was flawless.</em></p>



<p>The Zone can be terrifying, and at times I was <strong>jumpscared </strong>heading into a dark bunker and running into a Burer or a group of Bloodsuckers, but it’s also a beautiful and unique environment that I never got tired of exploring.</p>



<p>GSC built every inch of this map by hand, without any procedural generation, and it shows. The sheer depth of miscellaneous events, secret locations, and hidden stashes that you’ll uncover as you explore STALKER 2 is mind-blowing, and as you walk around the world, you’ll constantly find neat little spots off the beaten track that you’ll want to just <strong>look at</strong>.</p>



<p>If I have one complaint about all this, STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode, and I could snap thousands of images.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-adventure">Into The Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>STALKER 2’s story is one of the game’s shining gems. It’s intriguing, pitted with twists and turns, and from what I’ve learned, it’s very well connected to the rest of the series. It is loaded with enough mysteries to keep players guessing, and there are many opportunities to explore various playstyles as you run through the campaign.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that stealth in STALKER 2 feels a little tricky, but I much prefer going into any engagement guns blazing, and STALKER 2 accommodates that playstyle <strong>very </strong>nicely.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 isn’t a hold-your-hand game – to any real extent. It’s much more accessible than the other games in the series, but that’s because GSC wants to appeal to a more widespread audience. To that end, it’s mostly obvious where you need to go and what you need to do, and the game is light on puzzles, but even on the easiest difficulty, I died a few dozen times.</p>



<p>On several occasions, I found myself reloading earlier saves just to see what would happen if I picked a different choice at a critical point in the story.</p>



<p><em>I’ll be honest, though – I was looped into the development side of things and the team patched out more than 1000 bugs, ranging from game-breaking to minor, in the days before STALKER 2 was released.</em></p>



<p>As I played, I took these issues in my stride, determined to work around bugs rather than admit defeat in the face of them. I also recognised that I had a beta build, and I was appreciative that it was a work in progress at that point.</p>



<p>As I dove deeper into the story, I found myself fully invested and desperate to reach the next chapter or accomplishment. As a completionist, I felt compelled to tackle every side objective and hidden location I came across, and I never got bored of doing so.</p>







<h2 id="h-sheer-energy">Sheer Energy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In my opinion, it’s not fair to take points away from STALKER 2 because of the bugs I experienced – that’s because of the build I was playing on — <em>I hope</em>.</p>



<p>If I look past those issues, I see a game that <strong>I cannot fault in one major way</strong>. From the combat sequences to the direct and fully-acted cutscenes, and the survival mechanics to the random encounters that make the world feel so alive, I couldn’t find one <strong>serious</strong> flaw in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Minor flaws? Sure.</p>



<p>Killed enemies ragdoll more than you’d like, the AI of human enemies isn’t as advanced as you might prefer, and I’d like to see more loot scattered around the place to add a little variation, but it’s all very livable. </p>



<p>The voice acting is superb and very diverse, and even the piecemeal characters have some great lines, which only adds to that ‘alive’ sensation of the world you’re exposed to.</p>



<p><em>For instance, I left a fellow Stalker stranded in a field of electric anomalies because I was in a rush, and was subjected to abuse being hurled over the radio as I walked off, with the Stalker branding me a ‘rotten Flesh fucker’ in his dying moments.</em></p>



<p>The effects of the anomalies feel stellar, and the handiwork applied to bringing mutants to life is awe-inspiring. They’re genuinely terrifying and more than once I found myself killing an enemy and getting up close to them just to study the character model. In some ways, it was like the game was adjusting to my preferences as I played, too</p>



<p>Let me explain that. Early on, I had a concern that packs of dogs were far too common and irritating, and then as the hours unravelled, I found that I was brushing up against them much less. Perhaps the spawn rate was tweaked by GSC or something, but it felt as though the game heard me and responded to my worries.</p>



<p>Even without a photomode, I found myself snapping countless images of the world of STALKER 2. There wasn’t one location that failed to snatch my attention, and even a random truck stranded in a field felt like it had a point in being there and a presence. </p>



<p>I came to attach myself to the game’s characters very quickly, and when a quest led to an untimely death being revealed, <strong>I felt it</strong>. I became a character hellbent on helping as many people as I could, and pleasing factions became a mission of mine rather than a chore.</p>



<p>There’s enough meat on the bones already for me to declare this: <strong>STALKER 2 is the best game I have played in years</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of a post-apocalyptic adventure, STALKER 2 speaks to me on an intimate level, and every moment I spent in The Zone was sheer bliss. Every time I turned the game off, I had <strong>an itch</strong> to get back to it, and I’ve not felt like that about a game for a very long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Even the simple things, like the game’s intuitive UI and satellite-style map screen, won me over. The game’s visual palette is diverse and sumptuous, customising and using weapons feels satisfying and energetic, and every mission feels like it has <strong>a point</strong>.</p>



<p>Believe me when I say you will be blown away by the depth and detail in STALKER 2. The sheer level of attention and painstaking effort poured into the creation of STALKER 2 by GSC Game World is nothing short of utterly incredible, and I am so happy that this game was <strong>finally </strong>delivered after all these years.</p>



<p>I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2. This enormous, immersive survival FPS is the cream of the crop, and it’s a bar to which every developer in the genre should aspire to reach. Every minute you pour into this epic adventure will be well spent, and despite the horrors lurking within, The Zone will become your second home.</p>



<p>For a numerical rating, I give STALKER 2 a 9 out of 10. When the mods start flowing and the game’s core issues are addressed, perhaps with modders adding in some more immersion or customisation mechanics, I could see this being pushed to a 10 out of 10.</p>
