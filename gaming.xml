<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_to_the_Barrier_Peaks"><em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em></a> is an adventure that was originally written by Gary Gygax himself for <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1st Edition</em> in 1980. Our quickly thrown together party was DM'd by <a href="https://twitter.com/MakenzieLaneDA">Makenzie De Armas</a>, writer at Wizards of the Coast who recently worked on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a46e779c-d41c-4fff-b5fb-f04a72837c67" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-things-review-dd-5e-has-new-best-sourcebook">The Deck of Many Things </a>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c2ec0c-8e1a-4fc6-a97f-23659c5ab321" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-call-of-netherdeep-review"><em>Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fun note as we began our game was sentiments shared by other players, including <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonTaleTeller">Anton The Storyteller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cozywizrd">Mike Dunn</a>, who had spent time exploring Expedition To The Barrier Peaks in AD&amp;D. It was exciting to be sitting at the table with those about to embark on the journey for the first time, as well as those who had at least a partial idea of what to expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Settling in De Armas delivered a quick plot hook, the party had been tasked by a nearby town's mayor to investigate the strange creatures destroying settlements and so we were off to the mountains to investigate. It was explained that each of the adventures in this Anthology Series could be played in a sequential order, using Nafas the Genie who lives in the Infinite Staircase as a plot giver, but that each adventure can also be dropped into existing campaigns.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover_1.jpg?itok=y_gTHado 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover_1.jpg?itok=3VQ7Ea-T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nafas on both covers of Quests From The Infinite Staircase</figcaption></figure><p>Exploring the mountain the party encountered a cave, newly revealed by a landslide, and as we crossed the threshold the stone under our feet were replaced with cool metal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/games">De Armas took this moment to direct us towards the maps encounter</a>, which until now had been sitting with the message "Your DM is not currently hosting a game session." The screen came to life as we saw one of the beautiful maps from <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> appear, mostly obstructed.</p>
<p>Having built our characters as part of a Campaign within D&amp;DBeyond we could find our character tokens, add them to the map (already perfectly sized for the map) and begin combat as a Cloaker descended upon us.</p>
<p>After the quick battle we were met by a Robot who informed us that their leader wanted to speak with us. This wasn't an Auto-gnome, this wasn't an Automaton, Modron, or even a Warforged, but an honest to god Android.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robots-from-expedition-to-the-barrier-peaks_0.jpg?itok=QNSDxK0b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robots-from-expedition-to-the-barrier-peaks_0.jpg?itok=DW7u8Rzc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The top left robot is the one we met and our party named him Frederick</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we had stepped out of high fantasy and even further past Science Fantasy, we were fully immersed in a Science Fiction world.</p>
<p>The Maps feature of D&amp;DBeyond, while currently in Alpha, is one that I've been using as part of my home games as well as for adventures with other TechRaptor staff, including our recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/podcasts/vecna-eve-of-ruin-session-1-techraptor-podcast-117">four-part <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> series</a>. Admittedly, this was the first time getting to be on the other end of the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As De Armas revealed more of the map, erasing away the fog of war with a square erase tool, I was excited to hear my party mates reacting to the easy reveal of the world, and clicking sounds starting as De Armas let us know that you could move your tokens by selecting them and then using the arrow keys to direct them around the board like a video game. That was a new one for me too!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/an-effect-overlay-showing-a-breath-weapon-in-dndbeyond-map-tools_0.jpg?itok=2Vs7N3RS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/an-effect-overlay-showing-a-breath-weapon-in-dndbeyond-map-tools_0.jpg?itok=RznnHq7N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another new feature I learned about (recreated here with my home game) is that you can create effect lines, circles, and squares and change their color and symbol</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the rest of the adventure the party got to use tact to negotiate a deal between two warring groups of residents on the spaceship, two families of Vegepygmy, and learn about a number of interesting Tech Weapons available to find. One party member quickly picked up a Laser Pistol, while another got to donn a suit of Powered Armor.</p>
<p>Hearing about all that <em>Expeditions To The Barrier Peak</em> had to offer, including but not limited to malfunctioning combat robots and sections of the lower ship floor flooded with irradiation, De Armas also teased that there was a creature in the depths of the ship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asking if we could fast forward to that encounter De Armas was able to quickly show us off the rest of the first floor (of which we'd only managed to see a quarter of in four hours of play), skip through the second floor, and arrive in a central lush garden and lake area on the third floor. Here we faced the Froghemoth Elder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-view-of-the-third-floor-of-the-spaceship_0.jpg?itok=IhcHHyCn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-view-of-the-third-floor-of-the-spaceship_0.jpg?itok=A7KButxi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of space for a Froghemoth Elder to creep out of the water and leap on us...</figcaption></figure><p>Combat in the D&amp;DBeyond map tools against the Froghemoth was quick and easy. As the new map was loaded we were able to pop out each of our tokens, the Froghemoth Elder was already in place on the map where De Armas had put it prior to the session.</p>
<p>In combat we were able to keep an eye on all characters, use rings to indicate what status we might be under (the status options were only color based, I would love to see some text on the rings in the future to better indicate that especially if it could be tied to the status on the character sheet), and when three of our party had been devoured by the Froghemoth I was able to draw a box on the map outside of the battle that indicated tokens inside had been eaten.</p>
<p>Getting invited to this session was a lot of fun, and being led through the world by De Armas and a variety of robotic impersonations was an absolute blast. I can definitely see how while it's part of an anthology book depending on how your party takes their time this could easily be 5+ sessions of time.</p>
<p>It was also a blast getting to see others experience the D&amp;DBeyond map tools for the first time. There is still a lot of roughness around the edges, but if you're running a campaign inside D&amp;DBeyond, with maps and monsters that aren't homebrew it's incredibly easy to hit the ground running. Even if you are importing maps you can scale them so all miniatures match easily, and homebrew creations can be imported just as easily.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24189986/elden-ring-movie-tv-show-hidetaka-miyazaki-george-rr-martin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="rKbUbs"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> creators Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin seem to be hinting that a movie (or TV series) based on the open-world fantasy role-playing game is coming — or at the very least, they’re trying to will one into existence, based on recent comments from the two <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23723957/elden-ring-nebula-award-george-r-r-martin-dlc-expansion">Nebula Award winners</a>.</p>
<p id="Nu0oAY">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> director and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki said, “I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em>, a movie for example.” He noted that FromSoftware doesn’t have “the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium” and would need to rely on a “very strong partner” to make it happen.</p>
<p id="Q2Cyxb">“We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure,” Miyazaki concluded.</p>
<p id="ctshJF">A few days after that interview was published, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135223/elden-ring-did-george-r-r-martin-write-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc"><em>Elden Ring</em> lore co-creator</a> George R.R. Martin <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/">cheekily wrote on his blog</a>, “Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on<strong> </strong><em>Elden Ring</em>...<strong> </strong>I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?”</p>
<p id="m4rqI3"><em>Elden Ring</em> publisher Bandai Namco has hinted at an expansion of the game’s universe for two years now, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22980899/elden-ring-new-franchise-fromsoftware">hailing the game as the start of a new franchise</a>. When <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20220316_eldenring_salesdata">FromSoft and Bandai Namco announced</a> in 2022 that <em>Elden Ring</em> had sold 12 million units in its first month, the companies said, “Please look forward to more of Elden Ring as an IP [...]) in hopes of expanding beyond the realm of games.”</p>
<p id="H0vIwr">“Much effort was placed into creating <em>Elden Ring</em> in order to exceed the expectations of our fans worldwide,” said Yasuo Miyakawa, president and CEO of Bandai Namco Entertainment, in that announcement. “With a similar goal, we will continue our efforts in expanding the brand beyond the game itself and into everyone’s daily life.”</p>
<p id="Z5twO1">FromSoftware’s other games, including <em>Dark Souls</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/3/27/8209199/bloodborne-review-PS4-playstation-4-exclusive"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/21/18274733/sekiro-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>, have been adapted to other entertainment media, mainly in the form of manga and comic books that expand each title’s story. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-Road-Erdtree-Vol/dp/1975364899?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-Road-Erdtree-Vol/dp/1975364899?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23954027__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954027__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Elden Ring</em> has also been adapted to manga form</a>, but as a comedy starring a clueless Tarnished named Aseo who is pathetically struggling to become Elden Lord. Presumably, any bigger-budget adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em> would take a more serious approach.</p>
<p id="Bbjr5B">While neither FromSoftware nor Bandai Namco have officially announced a film or TV adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em>, it appears the game’s creators are on board. Such a project would give Martin another opportunity to not complete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23560856/winds-of-winter-release-date-george-r-r-martin-new-york-giants-football"><em>The Winds of Winter</em></a>, and give FromSoftware much bigger exposure outside of games.</p>
<p id="cOoBGA">But what would an adaptation of <em>Elden Ring</em> even look like? Likely not a direct adaptation of the events of the game, but as an expanded version of the lore that leads up to the setting of <em>Elden Ring</em>. Existing prior to the playable portion of this universe is a sprawling medieval fantasy political drama that involves complex familial and romantic relationships, political power struggles, and just a <em>tiny</em> bit of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23344676/house-dragon-episode-4-review-targaryen">incest</a>. Not only is that a proven recipe for Martin, a prequel outlining the lore of <em>Elden Ring</em> would certainly go a long way to helping its more than 25 million players understand <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020905/elden-ring-lore-story-plot-endings-radahn-ranni">what the hell is going on</a>.</p>

Generally, positive reviews highlight the new world of Tural and its diverse cast of characters, including everyone’s favorite Hrothgar, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-wuk-lamat-npc-love-1851569954">Wuk Lamat</a></span>. It’s no surprise that a lower-stakes adventure for the Warrior of Light and their best buddies through a tropical wonderland is hitting perfectly for a lot of long-time players. But it isn’t just the relaxing vibes and beautiful setting getting high praise, <em>Dawntrail</em> also brought with it quality-of-life features like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-7-0-patch-visual-upgrade-1851559585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-7-0-patch-visual-upgrade-1851559585">graphical update</a></span> which has made the game shine like new. The overall takeaway from positive Steam reviews is that <em>Dawntrail</em> is a breath of fresh air for the aging MMO in almost every way.</p><p>Shocking nobody, however, the fanbase is hardly unanimous on the matter. <em>Dawntrail</em> haters have two major problems. The first is Wuk Lamat. Yes, some of these people just hate Wuk Lamat! I cannot understand it but a lot of negative reviews are criticizing the character many other players adore. Specifically, the critique is that Wuk Lamat is so central to the overarching <em>Dawntrail</em> story that she effectively becomes the main character over the Warrior of Light. Second, some feel that the relaxing vibes of the expansion, rather than making it work as a vacation-like adventure, diminish it instead, making it too low-stakes with a boring nothing-burger of a plot. Some reviews go so far as to say that <em>Dawntrail</em> is as bad (if not worse) than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-the-kotaku-review-1796771052&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-the-kotaku-review-1796771052"><em>Stormblood</em></a></span>, the second and most-derided expansion to <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>. </p><p>Some of the criticism of <em>Dawntrail</em> is probably a result of how different its goals are from those of past expansions. From the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-the-kotaku-review-1440536417"><em>A Realm Reborn</em></a></span> until the conclusion of <em>Endwalker</em>, each expansion raised the stakes of the story and led to a climactic finale to a decades-long story. <em>Dawntrail</em> couldn’t have raised the stakes from <em>Endwalker</em>, and it’s meant as a de-escalation. Inherently that may be less exciting, but it is intentional. To tell a new exciting story you have to start from square one.</p><p>At the end of the day, Steam reviews have given me a sense of what to expect in <em>Dawntrail</em> when I finally get around to it. Most importantly, I now know that I will encounter sentient corn at some point, so I have more motivation than ever to get to Tural.

He also suggested a hotfix would arrive sometime "this week" alongside a brief server maintenance period.</p><p>"Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who has been playing Dawntrail since the start of early access," Yoshida said. "However, I would like to offer my sincere apologies regarding the issues that we have identified."</p><p>Xbox version issues have perhaps been most prominent, as the game client can become completely unresponsive when moving between locations. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation," Yoshida said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would like to offer my sincere apologies regarding the issues that we have identified.</p></div><p>Square Enix is looking into a fix for the problem but it will be "several days" before one is released, Yoshida said. This is because a patch must go through myriad checks by the quality assurance team.</p><p>"We are working to expedite the release of this patch at the earliest possible opportunity," he said. "However, we regret to say that this process will require some time. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes and appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to address the issue."</p><p>Players, in the meantime, may encounter the issue less if they play on worlds with low populations. "Until we have resolved the issue, we kindly suggest you consider playing on either the Dynamis, Shadow, or Oceania data centers," Yoshida said.</p><p>An incoming patch will also address freezing abilities not functioning properly and an issue with the display and animations of cerain characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida said. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period."</p><p>It's therefore likely all of these issues will still be in Dawntrail upon its full launch tomorrow, July 2, 2024. The accompanying <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-version-70-patch-notes-reveal-every-change-coming-alongside-dawntrail">Version 7.0 patch hade made plenty of positive changes</a> to the game too, such as new areas, quests, quality-of-life improvement, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-getting-a-major-graphics-update-with-new-requirements-for-dawntrail-expansion">a huge graphical upgrade</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-trailer-pictomancer-job-female-hrothgar-and-more-revealed-at-tokyo-fan-fest">the Viper and Pictomancer jobs</a>, but seemingly not without a few frustrating bugs.</p><p>Dawntrail's Steam page is also full of middling reviews, as while Final Fantasy 14 expansions are usually widely praised by fans and critics, Dawntrail has dropped to a "mixed" rating. Despite "review bombing" being a common tactic for players looking to express frustration, Dawntrail's current Steam user review rating appears to be the result of genuine grievances and not bugs.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-not-that-difficult-to-talk-about-fromsoftware-games.916332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is an albatross hanging around the neck of the latest FromSoftware release, the same as every FromSoftware release: difficulty. The problem is that talking about difficulty in the abstract like it’s a set value is boring, reactionary, and not particularly productive, It obfuscates the real trade-offs that From often makes with their games, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is very much a game of trade-offs. And the worst thing about it is that talking about these games critically with nuance is simply not that difficult.</p><h2>Mixed Blessings</h2><figure><figcaption>If you've gotten to this point you know exactly what this game's deal was, or at least you did a year or two ago. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is the DLC expansion to <em>Elden Ring</em> and from the jump, it is not an easy bit of DLC to unlock, requiring that you have beaten Mogh, an optional boss hidden in a fairly out of the way place. The placement, aside from its lore implications, is a significant choice and establishes who the DLC was always meant for: everyone who has beaten the extreme ends of <em>Elden Ring</em> into the ground, have hit the ends of the base game and gotten to around level 150. By touching the The Cocoon of the Empyrean, you are transported to The Land of Shadow, a reality with its own special rules.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Warning: Minor location, weapon, and boss spoilers ahead, although I have attempted to avoid discussing major plot elements whenever possible.</strong> </p><p>The second you go into the Land of Shadow, you quickly notice that everything in it hits you like a fucking fire truck. To balance the fact that people are probably overleveled going into this expansion, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> introduces a new mechanic, centred around items called Scadutree Fragments. By collecting these fragments, you are able to power up both the damage you deal and the damage you take. This is where nuance is important, because while the rationale for this system is smart and addresses a very real problem, it’s implemented quite badly.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>You will find Scadutree fragments around here, sometimes, mostly. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>It is clear that FromSoftware, who have created a gargantuan world, would like you to explore all of it instead of just boss rushing the whole thing, (To reduce this release to simple DLC would be underselling it, although I disagree that this is basically a sequel.) But they both clumsily tell you about the Scadutree Fragment system while never really stressing how significant a difference it makes in the basic playability of the DLC. The scaling, at least at launch, was gargantuan. What's more, by hiding leveling in a Korok-ass collectible, progression becomes a fetch quest.&nbsp;</p><p>This would be fine if there was some kind of cohesion about where shards appear, but there’s only a vague rhyme or reason behind their placement. Initially it seems like they mostly stay around crucifixes, but sometimes guys who have jars have them, and sometimes they are near statues, but also sometimes big hippos carry them, and once I saw one in a coffin under a waterfall. You could argue that this is no different than hiding Golden Seed flask upgrades, but I feel like those are fundamentally different mechanics. There’s a better way they could have done this, and I feel slightly vindicated here given the fact that they aggressively patched the scaling of the system as I was writing this blog, making the initial Scadutree Fragments more significant, and the later ones more gradual.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lands Between&nbsp;</h2><figure><figcaption>The verticality in these games is breathtaking, the map is somewhat annoying. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Forcing the player to explore the world is a valid choice, because <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>has some of the most gorgeous landscapes I have ever seen in a game. But many of those vistas are also a little empty, even by <em>Elden Ring </em>standards. It’s not uncommon to see beautiful, striking biome in the distance, get there, and then find like two things to do in them.&nbsp;</p><p>I do admit there’s a kind of beauty to a huge, empty space. The Abyssal Woods are terrifying, so much so that your mount will not let you summon it, forcing you to take this space on foot. And some of these locations serve important storytelling purposes just by dint of being there, like the Finger Ruins. And yet I can’t shake the feeling that the entire thing was either scaled back at one point, or that the game itself is simply masquerading as a much larger experience, like a bag of potato chips as my colleague Ash Parrish observed on Aftermath Hours. This was always a fundamental compromise of the base game, particularly near the end, but in <em>Erdtree </em>it is felt much more aggressively. I don’t even know that I want more things to do in those places; the expansion is the perfect length to me, but I can’t help but feel a sense of disappointment, or that these areas feel unfinished, a sensation that <em>Elden Ring</em> delivered much less frequently.&nbsp; Like the base game, <em>Erdtree </em>has a very showy beginning and middle, but loses cohesion in the extremities and the back section. That said, there are real highlights to the end, especially in the way the structure of the final area looks like an impossible Rodin sculpture.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Some of the most breathtaking environments in any video game. I wish they were not so hollow. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most striking things about the map is its verticality. Much of the Shadow Realm consists of massive cliffs and valleys, and there is something breathtaking about seeing locations far in the distance and wondering “how the hell am I going to get there?” This is a valid question, and one you may ask yourself repeatedly, because the routes to get to those places are inorganic and uneven in a way that I don’t personally find enjoyable. Artistically, there is validity to making huge parts of your map aggressively convoluted to find, but I always found that to be both the most elusive part and greatest weakness of Miquella's Haligtree in the original game. But unlike the Haligtree, there’s no <em>there</em> when you get there in <em>Erdtree</em>, and the tease of having these spaces that are distant and gorgeous but ultimately hollow half the time left me cold.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who’s the Boss?</h2><figure><figcaption>This game features some of the best and most confusingly tuned boss fights From has ever done. Rellana is a standout. Credit: Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>There is also the issue of bosses in this game, and in my fair assessment as a From player, there’s simply a lot of bullshit here. This is not unusual for a From game, and I love a lot of bullshit Souls bosses.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the bosses themselves are the logical conclusion trying to one up <em>Elden Ring</em>, and to account for players already having a medium sized arsenal of disgustingly broken gear. Some of the bosses, like the Golden Hippo or the Shadow Sunflower, are just straight up bad, the big sloppy monster type that is often in line with From’s weakest offerings. A few of the bosses are among their most creative and beautiful designs, featuring gorgeous cutscenes. Rellana and Messmer are standouts here. A huge portion of them have either some tremendously cheesy thermonuclear bomb up their sleeve, some flowing combo similar to Malenia’s Waterfowl Dance, or both. A handful are tuned very bizarrely, and favor certain playstyles and builds overly aggressively. The final boss is particularly guilty of this.</p><figure><figcaption>Everyone hates this hippo. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the choices make sense, as <em>Elden Ring’s </em>design was originally about offering the player some unreasonable challenges coupled with almost too many options than could be playtested at launch, and seeing how the player base could break the game. This flexibility gave it a mass market appeal that previous games did not. In terms of design, <em>Erdtree</em> is no different. I see a lot of people complain that these encounters are too “hard,” but a more accurate word is “unsatisfying.” Are these encounters balanced well, and what audience are they balanced for? Is that the same audience of 25 million that bought the game, or diehards who solo Malenia naked wearing a big fungus helmet? Is the friction rewarding and meaningful and does eking out a win feel good? There are some shining standouts, but a lot of times the answer for me is no.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Shadow of the Erdtree</h2><figure><figcaption>I will say, I like these guys. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes I wonder what lessons From took away from the meme-like popularity of Malenia, the optional ultra hard boss hidden deep in an easily missable section of the original game, because I feel her presence, the tradeoffs in her design and location, a lot in this game. But aside from the decisions that are outright bad, I don’t know how much I can fault the developers for how <em>Erdtree </em>is shaped, because many of the things I personally dislike are simply the logical conclusion to conceptual tradeoffs FromSoftware made to make a game as gargantuan as <em>Elden Ring</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Reskinning bosses and locations from other games and encounters has long been one of From’s favorite bits, and oftentimes they are good at recontextualizing assets in a way that either adds a new spin to them, contributes to the lore, or is very funny. Sometimes in <em>Elden Ring </em>this was implemented poorly or contributed to fluff: for example, there’s no reason for me to fight Astel twice, when even as an optional fight this choice made the first fight less special. This also rears its head aggressively in the DLC, where many lesser bosses are reskins of enemies that I have already fought, in a way that is <em>not </em>additive. Many of the dragons you find in the fields will feel familiar. One dragon in particular is very annoyingly balanced in a way that feels both cheap and disrespectful to the original encounter. To From’s credit, however, Bayle The Dread is very much worth fighting.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>You can fight these guys a whole lot if you'd like. Credit: Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>I would be remiss if I did not praise the new gear and spells here. I got through much of the DLC with a weapon called Milady and using an ash called Wing Stance to bleed enemies to death. The hand-to-hand combat weapons are enjoyable, although they feel conservatively balanced to be initially underwhelming. Giant katanas are a welcome touch, as are perfume bottles, which are currently busted the same way Hoarfrost Stomp was at launch. <a href="https://youtu.be/v20jFYM0nLI?si=xPoHbd3f_UzozQMZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber Syrobe discovered that Rolling Sparks ash</a>, when aimed at the ground and with a specific loadout, will decimate any boss in less than 20 seconds. Probably the best addition is the Deflecting Hardtear, a flask upgrade that temporarily buffs timed blocks to behave closer to <em>Sekiro</em>. Considering that <em>Sekiro </em>is From’s best game, and people have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensively modded</a> the base game to add <em>Sekiro-</em>style combat, that was a good choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I would be shocked if they don't nerf this Ash of War. Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>From games aren’t for everyone of course, but they’re also not for every From fan. They don’t have to be, which is an important part of this. I think <em>Bloodborne </em>and <em>Sekiro </em>are their most finely tuned games, in part because they are scoped much tighter. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>needs to account for so many variables because it’s an extension of <em>Elden Ring</em>, itself extended from the <em>Souls </em>games. There’s a million ways to beat every boss; it is an action RPG<em> </em>after all. Chasing that meta is itself a system to engage with, one that I find fun in the abstract but that has never got me to the same place of pure, placid flow as the Genichiro fight from <em>Sekiro </em>or even many of the fights in <em>Armored Core </em>VI.</p><p>I should stress that I do very much like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. There is a lot to praise about it, particularly when it comes to visual design, music and how it adds to the lore, which rank among FromSoftware’s best work. But it is following up on <em>Elden Ring</em>, a once-in-a-decade game that was a singular, impossible achievement when the industry itself seemed devastated by covid. Even if things had gone perfectly, it would be hard to recapture that same sense of grandeur, because the reality is you can’t enter the same Siofra River twice.&nbsp;</p><h2>“Hit them where they’re weakest”</h2><figure><figcaption>Why tell me this? Who do you think I am? Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>There is one series of choices in <em>Erdtree </em>that may seem very minor but make me mad every time I think about them. Occasionally in the expansion, you will see messages infrequently left on the ground not by players but by the developers. Alexis Ong noted this in their (quite good)<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eurogamer review of the game</a>, but I was not prepared for how inelegant these messages are. One group of them pertain to the behaviors of a very specific group of enemies. I will try to avoid spoiling the area or the enemies themselves, but they behave atypically. “Hide yourself,” “Await your chance,” “crouch in the undergrowth,” “combat is not an option.” Aside from sounding like tips in an Ubisoft open world game, that last bit of advice is categorically wrong in ways that are actively misleading, and not in a playful FromSoft way (several player notes around them advise the correct way to deal with the enemies.). There are other examples, like a lumbering golem with high defense and a huge obvious weak spot on its back. The game politely tells me “Hit them where they’re weakest,” as though I would never figure that out under my own steam. The worst offender I saw was a message that just said “I’ll be damned if there isn’t a way past the wall,” which seemed to nudge me to look for a small hole in the back of the building. I would understand this if it was in a mission critical area, but it’s just some side building with some stuff inside it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Who is the audience for this information? Credit: Bandai Namco Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>These choices, which I am guessing are the result of playtesting, are baffling to me because it goes against so much of From’s design philosophy. Do they not have faith that the notes laid by players are enough? Are they not confident in their design choices, and if not, why resort to a note instead of addressing those choices? And who do they think is reading these notes, hidden in optional content, down labyrinthine paths, in an aggressively challenging 40 dollar expansion that is, itself, hidden inside an optional end game dungeon? Again, it’s a very minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, but it made me severely doubt that From totally knows what they are doing, which I don’t do that often.</p><h2>Sound and Fury</h2><p>The worst part about all of this is the sheer amount of noise adjacent to any criticism of From games. Many people can be normal. But when it does manifest it’s either wildly reductive to the work or, more often, a childish accusation that the critic does not understand or is bad at the game. (I saw this happen in real time about the aforementioned EuroGamer review.) The latter is some Reddit six years ago shit, so much so that it feels quaint. This is annoying because I know firsthand that if you willingly sign up for FromSoft duty at a publication you’re very probably qualified to do it. I know this because I have been on hand for these pre-release. It can be gruelling and I am glad that I have never had to put a number next to any of them. The largest issue is that these games are designed for and react to the ecosystem they are released in, and so going into one of them half blind and under a hard deadline before that equilibrium is established is fundamentally more difficult and limited than the average player will face. This goes doubly so for people who do guides work; they are saints and angels who hold up half of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>But even in ideal conditions, my favorite conversations about these games happen well after their release. I have talked to friends who rank this expansion among their favorite things FromSoftware has ever done, and others who really hated it in the second half. Aside from being living texts, people’s relationships to these games are deeply personal, and I feel better having taken my time with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, to have digested it like a big meal, and to think about how it sat with me. I am glad that I can write this without SEO optimization or deadlines. I think these games deserve nuance, but what do I know? I liked <em>Dark Souls 2</em>.</p><p>See? That wasn’t that&nbsp;difficult.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When will Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 be released? More than two decades on from the launch of Ubisoft's original game, we still don't know - but Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition now demands that its succesor does arrive, and sooner rather than later. 
</p>
<p>
As well as technical upgrades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-originally-featured-in-beyond-good-evil-and-other-development-secrets">deep, fascinating behind-the-scenes developer archive</a>, Ubisoft's new version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil includes fresh story and new cutscenes which directly tie into the publisher's long-held plans for the game's successor. 
</p>
<p>
Characters from Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 (which is set to be a prequel) appear in video diaries showing them interacting with Jade as a young girl. There's also a brand-new cutscene featuring a specific character - and a big reveal regarding their relationship to Jade.

<p>
Progress far enough through Beyond Good &amp; Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition and Jade will acquire objects passed down to her from characters seen in some of the trailers for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 thus far. (You can also acquire some alternate cosmetic options for characters, including the outfit Uncle Pey'j is seen wearing in a previous BG&amp;E2 trailer.) 
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, BG&amp;E2 is set a generation before the original game, with Pey'j and a fresh group of human and animal hybrids living as space pirates aboard the starship Gada. 
</p>
<p>
Crew members such as Knox the Monkey are among those who have left items for Jade, which she can then learn more about via newly-added M-disc collectables. These are narrated by Dakini, the Gada's captain. Most offer brief looks at how each character interacted with the young Jade, though there's confirmation here that chief engineer Callum is not Jade's father (as some fans had speculated).

That said, a further full cutscene can be unlocked featuring Dakini which does offer a big reveal - that she is Jade's mother. For players, this is a sizable moment, though it is revealed through a scene where Jade sees a hologram of her absent parent - and it is not played as a surprise to her. The implication appears to be that Dakini and the rest of the Gada crew are simply elsewhere, and Jade has been left with her uncle for her own safety.

So, when will we see these plot threads be picked up on? In January 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">Ubisoft told Eurogamer</a> that "Beyond Good and Evil 2's development is under way and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise." Just this month, Ubisoft reconfirmed this statement to Eurogamer, and said the project remained on its schedule.
</p>
<p>Last week, Christian Donlan wrote how he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-just-got-a-new-edition-and-the-games-always-been-different-every-time-ive-played-it-anyway">viewed Beyond Good &amp; Evil as something of its own sequel</a>, as it remained rewarding to play multiple times. </p>

Here’s the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3037360/Funko_Fusion__Team_Fortress_2_Pack/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3037360/Funko_Fusion__Team_Fortress_2_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC’s store page description</a></span>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Packing more punch than the sandvich, this all-action add on is kind of a big deal! Relive some of your favourite Team Fortress 2 moments in Funko Fusion with these characters.</p></blockquote><p>You might be wondering: “Hey, where are all the other characters from <em>TF2</em>?” Or maybe you are asking: “Oh god, why does any of this exist?”</p><p>I can’t answer that last question, but as for your first, it seems Valve and Funko never got around to making figures based on the other characters, like Pyro or Sniper. Weirdly, I don’t think there was ever an official Engineer figure from Funko, but apparently, the devs wanted to include him anyway. Maybe that means the other TF2 characters could eventually arrive in <em>Funko Fusion</em> via a second DLC pack? I know I’ll be waiting intently for that day.</p><p>I don’t think many people would mind Valve approving a <em>TF2 </em>DLC for <em>Funko Fusion</em> if the studio still supported the game in a meaningful way.  However, that isn’t the case—the last major content for <em>Team Fortress 2</em> happened all the way back in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jungle_Inferno_Update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jungle_Inferno_Update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2017</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DaysTf2/status/1803545052766990620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DaysTf2/status/1803545052766990620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 2400 days ago</a></span>. <em>TF2 </em>also has a bot problem, with the annoying bastards constantly ruining matches, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tf2-team-fortress-bots-valve-fan-petition-fix-pc-fixtf2-1851519583&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tf2-team-fortress-bots-valve-fan-petition-fix-pc-fixtf2-1851519583">forcing players to run fan campaigns to get Valve’s attention</a></span>. </p><p>So yeah, for many players, watching <em>TF2 </em>continue to slowly die from a thousand cuts as Valve does little to help or grow the shooter has been a frustrating experience. And then <em>Funko Fusion</em> announces a <em>TF2</em>-themed DLC. It probably feels like rubbing salt in an open wound at this point. </p><p>  <em>Funko Fusion</em> will released on September 13 on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.

                <p>Sega has confirmed that the new upcoming Crazy Taxi game will feature an open world and contains multiplayer elements.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-crazy-taxi-title-will-be-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-according-to-sega/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer interview</a> (translated by Automaton Media), Sega said it is currently working on testing the game's multiplayer compatibility, including MMO elements. The goal here is to experiment with new mechanics for the game while keeping Crazy Taxi's chaotic feel. It boasts photorealistic visuals, and its setting and motifs are inspired by what looks to be California and the west coast. The developers explain that the bright yellow taxis with vibrant blue skies help create an energetic and exciting world. The open-world structure is also inspired by theme parks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQsitFYpg8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uLQsitFYpg8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While not much new footage was shown in the developer interview, it shows a player driving a police-style taxi while chasing down others in regular taxis, which gives a hint of what multiplayer concepts the team is working with, such as a tag or search-and-destroy kind of mode.</p><p>The new Crazy Taxi game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">announced at The Game Awards 2023</a>, along with new entries in four classic Sega franchises: Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Streets of Rage, and Golden Axe.

<p>Last week we got to sit down and hear from Justice Arman, Senior Game Designer, about what to expect when you get your hands on this new adventure book.</p>
<p><em>Quests From The Infinte Staircase</em> will be releasing on July 16th with an Early Access release of July 9th. While Early Access has traditionally been two weeks Wizards of the Coast wanted to make sure that players had time to spend with their families over the 4th of July holiday.</p>

Arman referenced his work with Planescape as another time that they've been&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I like to think of it as the first adventure for the 2024 rules"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much of the work as adventures were created was keeping an eye to the future rule changes.</p>
<h2>Covers and Artwork</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover.jpg?itok=G9MLeihW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-classic-and-alt-cover.jpg?itok=5K_9kMp4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Quests From The Infinite Staircase Regular cover art by Syd Mills and Alternate art by Patrick Ganas</figcaption></figure><p>On the standard cover you can see Nafas, like Durnan to the Yawning Portal, Nafas is a noble genie and quest giver related to the stories within <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em>. Across the cover you'll see all kinds of elements related to the different adventures within.</p>
<p>Nafas is also shown on the alternate cover art but with a more etherial look. "You can see the texture on his clothing, the whispyness or air" This artist does a lot with wind and because Nafas is an Air Genie they let him run wild letting him sell the idea of him being an "embodiement of etherial winds."</p>

<p>The Infinite Staircase was first introduced in <em>2nd edition Planescape</em> but it was mentioned more recently in the <em>2014 DMG</em>. The book opens with a chapter on what the Infinite Staircase is. The staircase is a unique way to travel the multiverse because there's doorways across this that could lead to anywhere. You just need to happen upon the right doorward to stumble upon the Infinite Staircase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They could be adventuring in a dungeon, open a doorway, and are greeted by the [Infinite Staircase]"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chapter on the staircase itself will go over the features of it like how gravity works, or what happens if you fall off it. There are also examples of what doors might look like and where could they lead. Nafas is also introduced in this chapter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nafas-the-air-genie-resident-of-the-infinite-staircase.jpg?itok=mzEOEha5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nafas-the-air-genie-resident-of-the-infinite-staircase.jpg?itok=rXl8cu4T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Artwork showing off the air genie qualities of Nafas from within the Senser of Dreams</figcaption></figure><p>The Senser of Dreams is the palace of Nafas where he lives on the Infinite Staircase. He was created when winds from each of the different doors came together spawning him as a noble genie. He's able to hear the many wishes from across the multiverse and tries to make that a reality. Nafas gets his name from the Persian word for Breath, this leans into his Air Genie qualities but also because he is the "Breath of the Multiverse."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a stat block for Nafas, a CR 23 elemental, and can be used for a Pact of the Noble Genie Warlock or he can be used to gain favor for a Wish spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adventures within this anthology will have the characters meeting Nafas who hears wishes, and you'll be asked to complete them. Nafas himself can't leave the Staircase but can ask you to assist, maybe for a reward? Like other anthology adventures you can also use them as stand alone adventures and not use Nafas as a quest giver.</p>
<p>Unlike previous anthology books like <em>Tales From The Yawning Portal, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c69efd7c-c5a7-4b44-a82c-59be6e59f819" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review">Candlekeep Mysteries</a>, or <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd0050cc-2541-4de8-858f-46e54f556d11" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/keys-from-golden-vault">Keys From The Golden Vault</a> </em>the adventures found in <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> are multi-level adventures that should take a few sessions to get through.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The First Adventure: <em>The Lost City</em> (1-4)</h3>
<p>The adventure was originally written by Tom Moldvay for the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8427f65d-d957-42a6-862a-cedb580b6ba0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-review-not-history-book-but-museum">Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Where the players meet a strange faction who is trying to restore their former glory, each with their own masks. The three factions that the players meet allow the players to join.</p>
<p>An update for this adventure is that joining these factions is easier, and not something denoted by gender. Players might get tattoos or masks upon joining. Each faction also has multiple stat blocks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mage-of-usamigaras_jaqueline-florencio.jpg?itok=XZ8KNwnf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mage-of-usamigaras_jaqueline-florencio.jpg?itok=EgxbrQWW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Artwork of the Mages of Usamigaras by Jaqueline Florencio</figcaption></figure><p>Another update is providing additional guidance for the encounters. Many of them have been rebalanced, because of the differences in CR from then to now, as well as reviewing treasure rewards and including new monsters.</p>
<p>When recreating these encounters there was a lot more thought given to the description of places, characters' motivations, and interaction opportunities with people or places.</p>
<p>The ultimate hook of this adventure is that the party will be trapped in this place and need to work with the different factions to get out, whether that be by working with or against these different cults is up to them.</p>
<h3>The Second Adventure: <em>When A Star Falls</em> - Level 4-6</h3>
<p>This is the first adventure in the book that came from the UK TSR team.</p>
<p>The players here are going to retrieve a fallen star to protect the power of prophecy from evil sages. The original kicked off with an encounter with a Memory Web, when it's slain the memories get released. It's a neat way of delivering a quest to players even if they just want to kill everything.</p>

The adventure will also have the players meet a clan of deep gnomes.</p>
<p>For players who like having the 'D' in <em>D&amp;D</em> players will encounter a Dragon at the end of the adventure.</p>
<h3>The Third Adventure: <em>Beyond the Crystal Cave</em> - 6-7</h3>
<p>Inspired by William Shakespeare the characters are searching for two paramores who didn't approve of their relationship, very similar to the story of <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>. Back in the 80s it was ahead of its time because you can complete parts of this adventure without any combat.</p>
<p>In the original game the players visit a 'magical garden' prior to the invention of the feywild, this has now been updated. Leprechaun's have been added as denizens of the fey that players will meet. They've been updated to be more akin to mushroom people in red clothing.</p>

What's interesting is that these are philosophical unicorns that like to ponder, one even has a pipe.</p>
<p>No combat is very much the approach with this adventure and because of that the DM are given a lot of tools for the kinds of conversations.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Adventure: <em>Pharoh </em>- Level 7-9</h3>
<p>In this adventure the characters are reached out to by the ghost of a pharoh. They've been asked to help break a curse on the Pharoh themselves as well as on the land. The party needs to recover two items. The dungeon here is more deadly. New diagrams have been included to help interpret the pyramid in 3D as well as artwork of the different levels.</p>
<p>For the inclusion review pass WOTC reached out to a historical expert in Ancient Egypt to make sure that while the adventure is in tact some aspects of it have been updated. Along the adventure the party will meet other adventurers, as well as a group who is also looking to see the land return to a more prosperous state.</p>

<p>A piece of art shown by Titus Lunter, done physically, is of the Pharoh's boat floating high in the sky.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Adventure: <em>The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</em>&nbsp;- Level 9-11</h3>
<p>There is a wilderness exploration that will become before the dungeon, then there's the portion that was included in the tournament version that was released, and then the Greater Caverns.&nbsp;This adventure is tied to a witch who created the Demonomicon. What kinds of weird demons and devils that can be down here</p>
<p>One important encounter is with the daughter of Iggwilv (who D&amp;D fans might be more familiar with calling Tasha), Drelzna There will be over 50 rooms in this adventure, and at level 9 that will take some time…</p>
<h3>The Sixth Adventure: <em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em> - Level 11-13</h3>
<p>Arman's favorite adventure tied with From a Star is the final adventure<em>, Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em>. The design team wanted to make sure to have an interesting location. With <em>Tomb of Horrors</em> taken the second choice was the strange tech adventure.</p>
<p>Characters reach a crashed space ship where they'll see strange denizens like androids who are training in battle. There is a boxing, martial art, and fencing unit among many others that you'll be meeting.</p>

It's an awesome adventure "but it's also kind of silly at times".</p>
<p>Players will get to find a variety of tech weapons and items. They could be small spaceship trinkets or charge based tech devices. Arman didn't want to tease too much so didn't delve further. These charged items will use the energy cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of weapons there will be laser pistols, needler rifles, and new granades. "If you were scared about giving them to your players you can always decrease the number of energy cells they find as a finite resource."</p>

<p>The original adventure structure was pretty… unstructured, but now there is more of a throughline to help the players have a sense of direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Update, 6.18pm:</strong> In a statement to Eurogamer, Xbox denied it had plans for "a Rimac dashboard", and called the new streamlined dash a "mockup".</p>
<p>"We currently have no plans for an Xbox Rimac dashboard," an Xbox spokesperson said. "For more information about this mockup video, please reach out to the Rimac team."</p>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story, 5pm:</strong>: A Top Gear segment about vehicle manufacturer Rimac may have unwittingly leaked a new mobile Xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>As spotted and uploaded to social media by XboxCore, the reveal came in a recent Top Gear segment about the Robotaxi.</p>
<p>It features a dash that is considerably different to the current iteration most Xbox fans would recognise, its signature "blades" reimagined to better suit a handheld device.</p>

<p>Games like Fortnite, Halo Infinite, and The Finals feature on the front page, although it's unclear what modes and features would be available for those gaming on the go.</p>
<p>The demonstrator says the Xbox functionality in the Robotaxi has been designed "to emulate the feeling that you have in your own living room".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Xbox for comment and will update you just as soon as we know more.</p>
<p>Remember Microsoft's Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone? The one that got announced in 2021, was cancelled in its original form a year later, then showed up on Phil Spencer's shelf after that, bamboozling everyone?</p>
<p>Well, if you've ever wondered what it could have looked like in more detail, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-xboxs-ill-fated-cloud-gaming-console-might-have-looked-like-according-to-newly-surfaced-patent">a newly surfaced patent might have some answers</a>.</p>
<p>A side-by-side comparison with the "old prototype" version of Keystone that appeared on Phil Spencer's desk in October 2022 also supports that claim, with both the patent and prototype version featuring the same front panel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187596/dnd-quests-from-the-infinite-staircase-backward-compatible-onednd-6th-edition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nLr6PR">If there’s one thing that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> has gotten right in the last decade, it’s anthologies: meaty volumes filled with disparate adventures loosely connected by a common theme. Titles like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22315969/dungeons-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/4/15107222/dnds-tomb-of-horrors-tips-for-dms-5th-edition-yawning-portal"><em>Tales from the Yawning Portal</em></a>, and the Nebula Award-nominated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23269854/dnd-journeys-through-the-radiant-citadel-review"><em>Journeys through the Radiant Citadel</em></a> are among this generation’s best official materials. At the dawn of a highly publicized <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180523/dnd-dungeons-dragons-2024-phb-dmg-core-rulebooks-revealed">revision of the 5th edition ruleset</a>, publisher Wizards of the Coast is making one last stab at greatness. Its final anthology for the current ruleset, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122063/dnd-dungeons-dragons-quests-infinite-staircase-historians"><em>Quests from the Infinite Staircase</em></a>, is landing at retail on July 16.</p>
<p id="ep2gKc">But as managing game designer Justice Ramin Arman said during a recent press briefing, <em>Infinite Staircase</em> is more than just the last book published for the original 5th edition. It’s also among the first to be published for the game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177102/dungeons-and-dragons-dnd-core-rulebook-revised-2024-preorder">2024 rules revision</a>. That makes it the exemplar for how the legendary tabletop role-playing game plans to handle the issue of backward compatibility.</p>
<p id="Gwns0U">Historically, every new edition of D&amp;D has pretty much been a clean break, with little but lore connecting one to the next. The result has been a fragmentation of the game’s community on generational fault lines. The most recent example came in 2008, when Wizards launched the 4th edition. Some folks — myself included — liked the 4th edition just fine, and dove headlong into the game and all of its tactical, miniatures-friendly glory. Other folks, not so much. They either moved on to other hobbies or games entirely, or glommed on to Paizo’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/1/12317888/the-story-of-pathfinder-dungeons-and-dragons-most-popular-offspring"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, which, at its inception at least, hewed very close to the 3rd edition.</p>
<p id="x9rWbi">Wizards, and its corporate owner <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998290/hasbro-layoffs-before-christmas">Hasbro</a>, would very much like for that not to happen again. Over the last 10 years, it’s managed to catapult the seminal TTRPG back into the public consciousness, growing its player base to what it claims to be new heights. Having only recently weathered the painful fiasco that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23587624/non-dnd-dungeons-dragons-ogl-controversy-indie-sales-numbers">the OGL debacle</a>, Wizards would like to change the narrative with this newly revised ruleset. </p>
<p id="Z2bGDN">Arman said that <em>Infinite Staircase</em>’s adventures are “truly playable regardless of whether you’re using” the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2014) or the soon-to-be-released <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024), and the same goes for the <em>Monster Manual</em> (2014) and the <em>Monster Manual</em> (2025). So how was that accomplished?</p>
<p id="iKcJFa">One of the ways is by changing how adventures give good guidance to Dungeon Masters.</p>
<p id="FfUr4i">“Something I find in older books of ours [is] sometimes when a monster appears, it might have a tactical suggestion or mention a specific monster ability,” Arman said. “A lot of the time that’s great, but if something happens in our [2025] <em>Monster Manual</em> that changes the name of an ability, we don’t want to confuse a DM who [only has access to] the updated version of that text.”</p>
<p id="ZIxeJ7">To be more frank, Arman said that <em>Infinite Staircase</em> won’t call out specific spells or abilities for a particular monster to use in a given encounter. Instead, Wizards will give DMs more broad advice for what they should do instead.</p>
<p id="QIlMRY">“When you see that there’s a Cloaker in this room, the text won’t say, ‘The Cloaker uses Phantasmal Illusions to create three illusory duplicates of itself,’” Arman said. “It might just specify what the Cloaker does without referencing that one-to-one text. What that does is almost give more general guidance in some places that’s more intuitive [than it previously might have been], rather than making it feel like you need to go cross-reference a specific ability or trait [in a book that you don’t have]. Which honestly, I think, makes the adventures more user-friendly, anyway. Because if you’re a new DM picking this text up, you don’t need to know what the abilities of a Cloaker [were in 2014]. You just need to know that it’s hiding, and it attacks.”</p>

<p id="VVcRXD">Is that guidance going to jibe for harried DMs on the go? Hard to say until we’ve seen all of the updated rules — something that won’t be possible until the revised <em>Monster Manual</em>, the last of the three core rulebooks currently in the production pipeline, is finally published in early 2025. But Arman says the team at Wizards is good for it.</p>
<p id="QqBgCh">“Look, I was D&amp;D fan [...] for a long time [before I came to work at Wizards of the Coast], and I recognize there might be a certain subset of people who are holding out [on the revised core rulebooks],” Arman said. “<em>Is it really backwards compatible? Let’s wait until it comes out, and let’s see.</em> But, you know, I encourage you to do that if that’s what you want to do. And if not, you can trust us. Look at the book when it comes out. You can see it on [D&amp;D Beyond], and see for yourself with the previews we’ve already had for the new <em>PHB </em>[on YouTube]. It’s still just as compatible with the new stuff as it is 2014 stuff.”</p>
<p id="Y5L1I8"><em>Quests from the Infinite Staircase</em> will be available at retail on July 16, including a version with a special alternate art cover made available only at local game stores. Those who pre-order the physical and digital bundle directly from Wizards of the Coast will receive their materials two weeks early on July 9. More information on the <em>Player’s Handbook </em>(2024) is rolling out right now on Wizards’ YouTube channel.</p>

He won’t necessarily replace all your other damage dealers, but he packs a serious punch.</p><p>Both of these bosses feature unique battle themes, and you’ll have the option to replay each battle by visiting the Virtual Trainer in-game.</p><h2 id="h10328"><a id="mitama"></a>What do the Mitama DLC packs do in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="866641c36163cd18fd370d3f4b9aad00" data-recommend-id="image://866641c36163cd18fd370d3f4b9aad00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a combat sequence in Shin Megami Tensei." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a combat sequence in Shin Megami Tensei." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ATLUS / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="866641c36163cd18fd370d3f4b9aad00" data-recommend-id="image://866641c36163cd18fd370d3f4b9aad00" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a combat sequence in Shin Megami Tensei." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also included in the Digital Deluxe version of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>are three Mitama-related packs. <strong>These include </strong>Mitama Dance of Wealth<strong>, </strong>Mitama Dance of Miracles<strong>, and </strong>Mitama Dance of EXP<strong>.</strong></p><p>For those new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, Mitama are rare enemies that drop valuable loot when you defeat them. Rewards include EXP, money, and Glory (the game’s equivalent of skill points). With the Mitama DLC packs turned on, the appearance rates of these enemies goes way up. Within minutes of taking these packs for a spin, I would spot groups of two or three Mitama in the game’s open world within <em>seconds</em>. They appeared so frequently that I quickly started ignoring them; something that I’d never do when they appeared at normal rates.</p><p><strong>Fortunately, you can toggle these three DLC packs off from the in-game main menu</strong>.</p><p>In short, <strong>these picks make grinding much faster in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em></strong>. <strong>However, that isn’t necessarily a good thing</strong>. The game’s difficulty curve is a bit lopsided.In the early game, it can be hard to defeat enemies while your roster of demons and spells is so limited. However, once you progress into the midgame and really develop your active party, you can completely overpower even major story bosses. The game only starts to get really tough again once you get into endgame and postgame content, where optional superbosses will push your skills to their limits.</p><p>All of this is to say that the Mitama DLC packs can help smooth over some of the game’s more challenging parts, <strong>but they otherwise really skew the game’s balance towards being way too easy</strong>. I’d say <strong>they’re most valuable to players deep into <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>’s postgame who want to build absolutely perfect teams</strong>. Otherwise, it’s very obvious that <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> was not balanced with this DLC in mind.</p><h2 id="h10329"><a id="worthit"></a>So is the Digital Deluxe version worth the extra 10 bucks?</h2><figure id="" data-id="0a8acd006121acc28dd2703ff9848731" data-recommend-id="image://0a8acd006121acc28dd2703ff9848731" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two female characters engage in a conversation in the middle of nature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two female characters engage in a conversation in the middle of nature." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ATLUS / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a8acd006121acc28dd2703ff9848731" data-recommend-id="image://0a8acd006121acc28dd2703ff9848731" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two female characters engage in a conversation in the middle of nature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On one hand, <strong>if you’re absolutely, 100% certain that you want all the DLC in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, then it’s technically better to get the Digital Deluxe version</strong>. The two subquest DLCs will run you $5 each, and the Mitama packs are $3 each. That’s $19 all together, or you can get an All-In-One bundle after purchasing for $15. Either approach will run you more money than getting the Digital Deluxe version for $10 more.</p><p><strong>Otherwise, I frankly don’t think the Digital Deluxe version is worth the money</strong>. These DLC packs primarily exist to make the game easier, which players can already do via the in-game difficulty settings. As it is, the DLC demons from the game’s original release are here, and they <em>already </em>offer huge power boosts to your team when you recruit them. The Mitama packs in particular hurt the overall experience more than they help, since they let you level up <em>way </em>too fast. This in turn minimizes the excitement you’d otherwise feel from spotting rare enemies in the wild.</p><p>Granted, the two new demons on offer here <em>do </em>have some sentimental value to <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>fans. I’m not here to judge anyone who purchases things that make them happy. I’m personally of the mind that two characters shouldn’t have been paywalled to begin with, but maybe that’s just the cost of business in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">an extremely hostile industry</a></span>.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>is a <em>fantastic </em>game. The entertainment it has provided me has easily surpassed several games I’ve spent $70 on. If you’d just like to show Atlus the extra support and enjoy a couple extra demons as fanservice, I won’t stop you. Just make sure to tune up the difficulty higher than you normally would. After fighting your fifth Mitama in just a couple of minutes, you’ll be <em>begging </em>for some semblance of challenge again.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here, we get to see a society of women—the equivalent of witches—who are experts on the Force. Mae and Osha are the only children in their tribe, and when Jedi Masters Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), Sol (Lee Jung-jae), Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman), and Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo) arrive to test the kids for potential Jedi knighthood, we learn that they have no father. They were conceived through some secret use of the Force, and their mothers don’t want the Jedi to find out the details.<br></p><p>This secret is a <em>massive</em> development for the show, and not simply because <em>Star Wars</em> fans will connect this birth and Mae &amp; Osha’s psychokinetic link to Rey and Kylo Ren’s coupling decades later, referred to as a “Dyad” in the Force by Emperor Palpatine. No, fandom-centric speculation is not what matters to me. I’m the fan that’s looking at where George Lucas found his inspiration for the Force itself, and why this challenges the real-world ancient philosophies upon which the entirety of <em>Star Wars</em> is based. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="93e82253662388dd9b036dfca6890c68" data-recommend-id="image://93e82253662388dd9b036dfca6890c68" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jodie Turner-Smith as Mother Aniseya in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jodie Turner-Smith as Mother Aniseya in The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93e82253662388dd9b036dfca6890c68" data-recommend-id="image://93e82253662388dd9b036dfca6890c68" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jodie Turner-Smith as Mother Aniseya in The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>See, the Force was inspired specifically by Mo Pai Nei Kung, an ancient energy manipulation method that involves balancing the Yin and Yang (“soft” and “hard,” aka Light and Dark) energies within the practitioner’s body to influence the external world. A man named John Chang was well known to create different kinesis effects, such as burning paper by hovering his hand over it (see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0AZU8S9F0yI?si=pBbYyx8gBy2RCtwL&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0AZU8S9F0yI?si=pBbYyx8gBy2RCtwL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the VHS videos uploaded to YouTube</a></span>).<br></p><p>It doesn’t matter if you train Nei Kung (I teach it), it doesn’t matter if you believe in “chi” (aka “qi”). If you’re invested in <em>Star Wars</em>, you’re invested in a narrative universe that references real-world philosophies and modalities, especially Eastern ones, that are senior to and related to many ideas in Western fables, fairy tales and religious parables. It doesn’t take an academic to see how <em>Star Wars</em> previously referenced the Immaculate Conception for Anakin Skywalker’s birth without a father in <em>Attack of the Clones</em>. Now, <em>The Acolyte</em> is connecting the chi-inspired Force to Mae and Osha’s unique birth, and further frames the method of achieving a “miracle” as what can be perceived as witchcraft.<br></p><p>As someone who has a profound amount of interest in and respect for all religious paths, I find this creative choice incredibly compelling. Science fiction (we shouldn’t forget that that’s what <em>Star Wars</em> is) is <em>the genre</em> to challenge old ideas and catalyze us to look at things from a new perspective. Whether it’s framing ancient energy manipulation practices as the Force, or the concept of spontaneous birth that is found in several religions from Christianity to Hinduism, <em>The Acolyte</em> is raising its profile by using fiction to re-examine these beliefs.<br></p><p>I truly hope future episodes can handle the weight of these subjects with increasing grace and maturity. My fear is that the wisdom required to do so is quite rare, and that the series may chicken out of bold conclusions in favor of the easy way out for <em>Star Wars</em> writing: either lightsaber battles or a space chase. Although, neither of those would be too bad…&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-delayed-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cataclismo</em>, an upcoming RTS from&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse, has been delayed by a few days, and the decision has also been made to release the game in Early Access.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422440/view/4222769301380727215" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam news post announcing the changes</a>, Hooded Horse and developer Digital Sun say that the delay, which will see the game launching on July 22nd, is intended to "get everything in place for a successful [Early Access] launch".</p>
<p>The devs also say that Early Access was chosen to "polish the game alongside our community", calling this model "the perfect tool" to ensure that the finished product is as good as it can be, a position with which I'm sure&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-ceo-early-access-comments">Thomas Mahler would agree</a>.</p>

<p>The two studios say that the Early Access period for&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will be "short", and it sounds like the game will have plenty of stuff to do.</p>
<p>At launch,&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will feature a campaign complete with a tutorial and eleven levels, with more coming before the 1.0 launch. It'll also offer a skirmish mode across "two different levels and biomes", as well as an endless play mode and a level editor.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, it's a hybrid real-time strategy and tower defense game created by the folks behind roguelike shop management sim&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em>.</p>
<p>During the day, you'll build up your defenses and gather resources with "Lego-inspired mechanics", and by night, you'll use the traps, fortifications, and troops you've amassed to defend your stronghold from encroaching horrors.</p>
<p><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>will boast a realistic physics model that allows you to crush enemies beneath falling bricks, and when the full release arrives, it'll also offer a full 30-hour campaign "with VA and cutscenes".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on July 22nd.

We first started noticing issues <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1d9kl56/playstation_stars_not_working/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1d9kl56/playstation_stars_not_working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around June 6</a></span>, when PlayStation Stars, accessed via small icon on the home screen of the PlayStation mobile app, wouldn’t open. Instead, players were greeted by an error message: “PlayStation Stars is currently experiencing issues. Our engineers are aware of the issue and working on a solution.”</p><p>The timing was especially odd, since Sony was running a bunch of PlayStation Stars promotions alongside its mid-year Play Days sale event. This meant there were certain collectibles and awards that could only be earned by purchasing and playing certain games during the event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.truetrophies.com/news/playstation-stars-points-offline-june-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/playstation-stars-points-offline-june-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to PlayStation Support</a></span>, users would continue to accrue points and collectibles even while the program was down, though they wouldn’t be able to see any of it, let alone track what was still incomplete.  </p><p>25 days later, the program is still broken. As users on the PlayStation Stars subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1dq23nm/will_playstation_stars_be_down_longer_than_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1dq23nm/will_playstation_stars_be_down_longer_than_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been predicting</a></span>, that puts it beyond the 23 day outage that PSN infamously suffered back in 2011 following an unprecedented hack. During that period, PS3 players were unable to play games online, buy them digitally, or use any of the console’s social features. Once service was restored, Sony apologized by giving players free games and a month of PS Plus on the house. </p><p>PlayStation Stars wasn’t hacked, doesn’t cost money, and is used by far fewer people, so its outage is hardly a scandal in the scheme of things. It’s just very strange, and Sony hasn’t yet clarified what exactly the problem is nor when the rewards program will be back up and running. The company did not respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lays-out-plans-to-combat-switch-2-scalping/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the highly anticipated release of the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next year</a>, the company’s president has unveiled a significant plan to combat scalping. This plan is a reassuring step for players who often face the challenge of securing a new console on launch day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an earnings call, Shuntaro Furukawa, the President of Nintendo, recently addressed the issue of scalping for their next console. As per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-wants-to-avoid-switch-2-scalping-by-making-enough-to-meet-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Furukawa addressed three main pointers:</p>



<ol>
<li>Nintendo will make sure that they provide an appropriate amount of stock so that the supply matches the demand.</li>



<li>Furukawa stated that they will consider the “circumstances in each region”.</li>



<li>Semi-conductor shortage will not be an issue for the Switch 2&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Scalping, or the reselling of consoles at inflated prices, is a frustrating reality of new releases. It forces many players to shell out far more than the intended price for the device. A direct instance of this was seen during the PlayStation 5 launch, with consoles sold at 2 to 3 times the market retail price. Players left with no other option, had to purchase at these inflated rates. This plight, where players are compelled to pay exorbitant prices due to scalping, is a situation that resonates with many.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three main factors contributed to the shortage of consoles at retail. Firstly, the console was released during the pandemic, which had already caused production issues globally. Secondly, there was a shortage of semiconductors, further delaying production. Lastly, Sony’s limited drops allowed scalpers to dominate the market, leaving genuine buyers empty-handed. It’s crucial to understand these factors to anticipate the availability of the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next game in the Halo franchise has a new lead designer. First spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhwa83K3-U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebs Gaming</a>, 343 Industries has hired Dan Gniady as the new lead designer for Halo 7, or whatever they decide to call the game. </p>



<p>Gniady previously worked as a lead designer on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyenas</a> at Creative Assembly, and as a designer at Bungie for a decade. During his time there, he worked on both Destiny titles as well as various expansions for the games.</p>



<p>“After speaking with a ton of cool teams about rad projects I’m getting a shot to work with the Chief and friends,” Gniady posted on his LinkedIn page last month. “I love Halo and am very excited to be a part of adding to its legacy.”</p>



<p>Halo 7 is in development at 343 Industries and appears to be using Unreal Engine based on another job posting. No other details or confirmation about the state of the next game in the franchise has been announced by Microsoft as of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-modder-restores-secret-ending-scrapped-by-cd-projekt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning: This article contains some spoilers for the ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt alongside a handful of minor spoilers from The Witcher book series.</strong></em></p><p>A <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> modder has discovered and restored a huge chunk of gameplay cut from the beloved role-playing game's ending by developer CD Projekt.</p><p>This extended ending, outlined by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GMtR7U_hI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xLetalis</a> and modded by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSPKfadbmawD0zH13mxLnA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glassfish777</a>, begins after protagonist Geralt's fight with Witcher 3's main antagonist, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Eredin">Eredin of The Wild Hunt</a>. Geralt is pulled away from this fight after his victory by potential partner and powerful sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg in the actual game, but in the cut content instead wakes up in a tent, being seen to by two doctors.</p><p>A restored cutscene here shows the pair making a bet over whether or not Geralt lives, and the witcher wakes up with his own snappy response: "I'll take that bet." He eventually leaves the tent and encounters Yennefer in a scene with varying dialogue depending on if players entered a relationship with her or fellow sorceress Triss Merigold.</p><p>Geralt can ask who won the war here, and Yennefer responds by explaining the Skelligans fled the war after the death of Crach an Craite, whose death during the battle wasn't mentioned again in the full game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Cut Ending Content</h3></div></output><p>Subsequent scenes show just how much CD Projekt scrapped here, as entire groups of miscellaneous background characters are fitted with their own dialogue. Some are veterans of Cintra, for example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">a story from the book series</a> and Nilfgaard's first venture north, while others have unique dialogue about murdering someone.</p><p>Geralt then attends Crach's funeral, meeting Triss on the way. This too has varying paths depending on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/King's_Gambit">who became the new king or queen of Skellige</a>. Further interactions show a conversation between Yennefer and Triss and Geralt meeting The Lodge of Sorceresses.</p><p>It's this final point which has the most dramatic story change to the main game and general Witcher lore, however. The Lodge is essentially a secret society of powerful sorceresses who seek to control the myriad countries of The Continent from behind the scenes, only featured briefly in Witcher 3 as Geralt reunites them to help fight The Wild Hunt. After the battle, however, it's not mentioned again. But Yennefer betrays The Lodge in this version.</p><p>She does have a complex relationship with its members, told throughout myriad books and games, but Yennefer's decision comes as part of a deal to save Ciri, as she essentially sells them off to Nilfgaardian emperor Emhyr var Emreis, who seemingly plans to kill them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Geralt can respond in three different ways, which again unfold to grander repercussions, but he doesn't appear to be particularly happy with Yennefer regardless of the option chosen. Witcher fans will likely long debate whether or not this should have happened in the game, and why it was removed in the first place.</p><p>This sequence took place immediately after what's essentially the final boss fight though, and preceding another intense scene where Geralt and Yennefer rush across an island as monsters emerge from portals all around them, so it was perhaps just cut for the sake of pacing.</p><p>This deleted content is the first major discovery following the release of REDkit: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-month">an official modding tool for Witcher 3 released by CD Projekt in May 2024</a>. The developer announced REDkit in November 2023, saying "it will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content."</p><p>It didn't say anything about fans digging up its own scrapped content, however, and more does exist. CD Projekt has previously commented on cut missions related to Iorveth from The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, for example, so perhaps fans will revive that and other sequences too.</p><p>REDkit has otherwise been used to create some wild and wacky mods for Witcher 3, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-roach-this-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-lets-you-ride-a-vicious-fiend">one that lets Geralt ride an enormous fiend instead of Roach</a> and another that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/get-a-taste-of-the-witcher-remake-with-mod-that-puts-original-games-maps-in-the-witcher-3">recreates the original game in Witcher 3's engine</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">an official remake</a>.</p><p>Mods will be the only new content coming to Witcher 3 going forward, of course, as while the game received <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Biggest_Changes_in_the_Next-Gen_Update">a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S update in December 2022</a>, it otherwise won't get any more official content as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-cd-projekt-red-game-in-development">CD Projekt focuses on its wealth of other incoming projects</a>.</p><p>The highly anticipated next mainline Witcher game, codenamed Polaris, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">is currently in development</a> but won't arrive until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-is-at-least-three-years-away">2025 at the absolute earliest, and probably later</a>. There are two other Witcher games on the horizon too, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">the aforementioned remake of the original Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">a multiplayer spin-off</a>.</p><p><em>Image Credit: </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3GMtR7U_hI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xLetalis</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSPKfadbmawD0zH13mxLnA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glassfish777</a> on YouTube</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-aces-is-like-playing-a-noir-comic-book.916236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fallen-aces-episode-one-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every time the question “what games are you looking forward to?” comes up on our <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a>, I freeze a bit. With the decimation of studios like <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkane Austin</a>, they aren’t making a lot of “Riley games” anymore–i.e., immerse sims, full of vents to hide in and multiple ways to tackle a level. Early access game <em>Fallen Aces </em>isn’t scratching all of those itches for me, but it’s reaching some of them.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411910/Fallen_Aces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallen Aces</em></a> is an episodic noir detective story from New Blood, with one episode out and two more to go. The setup is familiar stuff: you play as a down-on-his-luck detective in a grim city, and someone wants you dead. The cutscenes are told through comic book-style panels, and the rest of the art style reflects that too. Enemies and interactive objects are two-dimensional, an effect that’s weird at first but gives the world a cartoonish, almost whimsical vibe that meshes well with its pulpy dialogue and offsets some of the brutal violence you get up to as you fight your way across the city.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fallen Aces: Episode 1 Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTWta2kwHzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You don’t <em>have</em> to fight, though. In the spirit of the immersive sim, <em>Fallen Aces </em>sets up a situation and lets you figure out how to deal with it, not funnelling you into combat or stealth. In the opening scene, the hotel where you live is overrun by gangsters. You can battle them all, punching and kicking and making use of whatever weapon is at your disposal. Or, you can sneak through vents and over rooftops to escape unscathed. I found myself employing both options, picking off enemies one by one in a shadowy area where enemies were spread out, and in another going to town on everyone with a combination of thrown trash cans and a board with some nails in it.</p><p>I’ve seen some players call the combat simplistic, but it kept me on my toes through the number of enemies and weapon durability meaning my favorites would often break during a fight, leaving me to scramble for a backup plan. I used my fists a lot, striking and dodging like a showboating boxer. There’s firearms, but their ammo is limited and takes up your inventory space, making them not my preferred option. For me, fights felt fast-paced and exciting without ever being overly challenging.&nbsp;</p><p>The usual early access caveats apply: while I had a lot of fun in my several hours with the first episode, I’d understand players wanting to wait to see the whole story through, or to see what changes based on player feedback. (However, New Blood writes that the price of the game will go up as more episodes get added.) For me, a quick, personality-filled romp was just my speed, and I’m happy to have finished what the game has on offer and then take a break until there’s more.</p><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> isn’t <em>exactly</em> an immersive sim; another early access detective game with a unique art style and a strong atmosphere, <a href="https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-indie-detective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadows of Doubt</em></a>, hits those notes a bit louder for me. But it’s cool that we’ve got at least two very Riley games in the works, and that early access means there’s more to come for them both.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/01/kunitsu-game-path-of-the-goddess-preview-dancing-swords-in-the-moonlight/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We need more games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. I’m not talking about its specific blend of gameplay – though a few copycats wouldn’t go amiss, if you ask me –but rather that it’s Capcom that’s making it. With so much focus on AAA games that take the better part of a decade to produce, it’s always refreshing to see smaller teams within major publishers producing niche and inventive games that have become the preserve of indie developers in recent years. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is one such game, and could be a real surprise for anyone that dances on over when it comes out later this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LvYXyFdYLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How to describe Kunitsu-Gami is a tricky one, though. There’s so many elements at play, but you can see the shadows of Monster Hunter, Pikmin, Kingdom: Two Crowns and plenty more besides dancing across its backlit tapestry. And that tapestry is a gorgeously woven rendition of Japanese mythology and religion that skips and dances across your screen.</p>


<p>The game’s story sees you trying to cleanse Mt. Kafuku of the defilement by twisted and evil spirits known as the Seethe. As the Seethe spread across the mountain, it consumed small villages dotted across the slope, leaving villagers cocooned while creepily many-handed growths have sprouted at various points around each locale.</p>


<p>It’s your quest, as Soh, to guide the divine maiden Yoshiro through each village, free their inhabitants, and fight back against the waves of the Seethe that attack at night. There’s a clear divide between daytime and night, with the former all about rapid exploration and preparation, and the latter then takes on the tone of a tower defence game as you protect the Maiden from attack.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to do during the preparatory phase, as you race around the map trying to destroy core patches of corruption and free villagers –&nbsp;you earn a bonus for clearing everything within a village, in the form of a new Tsuba Guard ability that could be a flashy attack, a group buff, or more. You also have to decide how far Yoshiro should move through the village along the main path of corruption that needs cleansing, triggering her ritualistic dance toward the utterly consumed Torii gate at the end of the stage.</p>
<p>Yoshiro will only be able to move so far in a day, though, and if she can’t reach a gate in time, the Seethe will spew out once again, so a village cleansing level will often require multiple day-night cycles to overcome and feature multiple gates to cleanse. So you need to spot the most defensible points, light beacons to illuminate the surroundings, fix up barriers and more in order to prepare. You also need to give any rescued villagers a class defining mask to let them fight alongside you. From an axe toting Woodcutter, to an archer, or an Ascetic that can slow and debuff enemies, and beyond, you’ll have to make choices based on the kinds of Seethe coming out of the gate, and the place them to cover paths and attack lanes. Thankfully, you can very quickly switch their roles and move them during the night, adapting to the oncoming waves.</p>

<p>You also have Soh himself, who is a master of “dancing swords” combat. Through the few levels I played, I would often race right into the action and unleash my simple sword attack combos, while having the villagers set up more to defend Yoshiro and clear up anything that snuck past me. The main trouble at this early point was with the flying Seethe, as I had yet to unlock Soh’s bow to more easily take them down, but there were further challenges that emerged, such as an enemy that would buff and protect the Seethe around them.</p>
<p>After successfully cleansing a stage, that village then becomes a hub that you can revisit, upgrade, and apply improvements to Soh and the various mask classes you have. Running around the now serene mountainside villages, you can assign the villagers construction and repair tasks that will be completed after your next mission, rewarding you with the materials and currency needed to then improve your kit. There’s also a tent for Yoshiro to hang out in, and visiting her will let you add upgrades for the masks you’ve collected so far, swap between Tsuba Guard abilities, and so on.</p>

<p>But then there’s the Festering Seethe, giant monsters that bring out those Monster Hunter and Pikmin comparisons, as you and a small band of villagers step into their arenas and seek to do battle. The most imposing of these that we faced was an oversized centipede monster that would rampage around a darkened arena, occasionally knocking gross grubs from the ceiling to attack Yoshiro. It’s a battle of health bars, as you once again need to protect Yoshiro and fight off smaller Seethe, but also have to deal damage to the main boss and, in the case of this particular beast, during the right times.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of depths to the tactics and strategy in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess that I wasn’t able to explore during my hands on time, but I already love the game’s blend of gameplay, visual stylings and overarching tone. It’s a game that at many points can look serene and in complete control as Yoshiro performatively progresses through a stage, but feels like a madcap dash and struggle to get everything done and prepared just in time to keep her safe in the fight against the Seethe.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-dlc-updated</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-updated-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree.916218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-dlc-updated<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>seamless co-op mod has been updated to add&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>support, which means it's now theoretically possible to play through the entire DLC in a single co-op session.</p>
<p>The aptly-named Seamless Co-op mod&nbsp;was updated yesterday, with a rewritten version adding support for the open-world RPG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">recently-released DLC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downside, however, is that Seamless Co-op is in beta for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. The devs say that the mod has been completely rewritten and thus "requires extended beta testing", urging&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>PC players to "be understanding" if they check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8Xf6UNJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8lH_5rq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to experience&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>with your squad in tow.</figcaption></figure><p>In theory, this mod should allow you to journey through the Land of Shadow with your friends without needing to send them home after bosses, but since the mod is in beta, some teething troubles should be expected.</p>
<p>However, the base game's mod theoretically allows players to continue playing alongside one another as part of a continuous session. This means that players who die won't be returned to their home worlds, and if players vanquish a boss together, they'll remain in the same world.</p>
<p>Everyone in a session can mount and ride Torrent, and NPC dialogue will be synchronized across players, as will map waypoints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, in theory, all of this is now possible for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, but you'll have to copy across any save data you have from the base game, as saves for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;Seamless Co-op mod are technically treated as different entities.</p>
<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to install the mod, as well as any other steps you might need to take, over on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus Mods page for Seamless Co-op</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-party.jpg?itok=A7kW4rnZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-party.jpg?itok=pgjMiNbv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some teething troubles should be expected when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;Seamless Co-op&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>implementation.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a major expansion for From Software's punishing action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC launched last week to rapturous reviews and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">strong sales</a>, although some players are divided on its difficulty and PC performance. From Software and publisher Bandai Namco have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">since issued an update</a> that adjusts the difficulty curve slightly, although it's unlikely to address every player concern in this area.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">our review of the DLC here</a> if you want to know how it shakes out.</p>

            <p>
Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) must pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee who brought a discrimination claim against the company.
</p>
<p>
The case, filed by Star Citizen senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion, revolves around a return-to-work policy that also involved work from the company's new central Manchester office location - some 15 miles from its previous Wilmslow location. 
</p>
<p>
Ah-Thion, who previously worked in-office at Wilmslow, brought the case after his requests to work remotely rather than travel into central Manchester were denied and he was subsequently terminated.

<p>
CIG had previously allowed Ah-Thion and other employees to work remotely for several years, but in 2022 decided to take a "tougher" stance on remote work, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a> reported.
</p>
<p>
The tribunal dismissed "rather retrospective" claims by CIG that Ah-Thion's performance had been a concern, and decided that allowing him to work from home would have been a "reasonable adjustment".
</p>
<p>
CIG's penalty of £27,748 includes more than £14k of lost earnings, and £12k compensation for injury to feelings.
</p>
<p>
"I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging," Ah-Thion said. "But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees.
</p>
<p>
"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing - all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted CIG for comment. 
</p>
<p>CIG has now raised more than <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">$711m</a> in funding for Star Citizen, its long-in-the-works space MMO. In 2022 it laid out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-lays-out-increasingly-ambitious-five-year-plan">ambitious plans for growth in the UK</a>, including the opening of the aforementioned Manchester studio, with a plan to grow the company's then-400-person team to 1000 by 2026.</p>
