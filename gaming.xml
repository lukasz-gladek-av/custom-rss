			<p>The latest PC games to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are Prologue: Go Wayback!, which launched last Thursday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, and Project Motor Racing, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/299970/Project_Motor_Racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> today.</p>



<p>The former is a single-player, open world, emergent, survival roguelike game created by PUBG creator Brendan Greene and his team at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In Prologue: Go Wayback!, players can traverse a new wilderness space of around 64 square kilometers that is generated every time they play. They can chart a path across rugged terrain, overcome the elements and write their own exploration story as they attempt to reach the distant Weather Tower. The game has a year of content updates already planned, after which it will launch its 1.0 version. Players with a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU can activate DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates. GeForce RTX 40 Series users can boost their FPS with DLSS Frame Generation, and all other users can enhance performance with DLSS Super Resolution, which leverages NVIDIA's latest transformer AI model. </p>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the second of a series of game projects planned by PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions, the ultimate goal being Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game that is still many years out. You can read our exclusive interview with Brendan Greene <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>As for <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Motor Racing</a>, it's the new racing simulation game developed by Straight4 Studios and published by GIANTS Software. The game offers racing fans 28 tracks spanning multiple eras and over 70 faithfully replicated cars across 13 racing classes. Project Motor Racing includes a single-player career mode, a multiplayer mode where you can compete against others and navigate races packed with four classes, all of which are attempting to win their respective categories simultaneously. GeForce RTX 50 Series players can use DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get maximum performance. GeForce RTX 40 Series players can increase their frame rates with DLSS Frame Generation, while all other users can activate DLSS Super Resolution to enhance image quality using NVIDIA's most recent transformer AI model.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the city builder game Whiskerwood <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched on Steam Early Access</a> by Minakata Dynamics and Hooded Horse. Its twist is that you do not manage humans, but mice who toil under cat overlords. A free demo is available, and both the demo and the full game support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA.</p>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA reminded its users that the highly anticipated action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-mirror-realm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was showcased once again last week</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview event, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one.</p>



<p>As a side note, NVIDIA users can claim a free Battlefield 6 Marksman SVK-8.6 DMR weapon skin from the NVIDIA app with GeForce Rewards by following these simple instructions: load the NVIDIA app, click “Redeem” on the left nav, and follow the steps to get the skin while supplies last.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-clears-32-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off-2000647195</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-32%E2%80%B3-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off.1364053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 57-inch Odyssey G9 ultrawide monitor commands attention and premium pricing,<a href="https://kotaku.com/samsung-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1ms-is-800-off-hardcore-gamings-holy-grail-at-a-record-low-2000646508"> even when sales roll around</a>, but not everyone wants or can accommodate a display that dominates entire desks and requires dedicated space planning.</p>
<p>Standard-sized desks deserve premium gaming monitors too, and the <strong>32-inch Odyssey G55C delivers flagship features</strong> in dimensions that fit normal workspaces without sacrificing immersion or performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/">At $199, down from $329, this QHD curved gaming monitor has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and became the <strong>best-selling model across Samsung’s entire Odyssey lineup</strong>. That combination of 1000R curvature, 165Hz refresh rate, and genuine HDR10 support at this aggressive discount explains why it’s so popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000R Curvature That Matches Human Vision</h2>
<p>This <strong>2560 x 1440 QHD resolution packs 1.7 times more pixel density than standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;and makes for noticeably sharper visuals where text stays crisp and game details remain clear during fast motion. As it is a sweet spot in resolution, it offers meaningful visual improvement over Full HD without the extreme GPU horsepower that 4K displays require to maintain high frame rates in demanding games.</p>
<p>Modern mid-range graphics cards handle QHD gaming comfortably at high settings, something that often forces compromise between visual quality and smooth performance if using 4K. Its wider aspect provides more horizontal screen real estate, which benefits both gaming and productivity by allowing the display of more content simultaneously, whether tracking enemies in competitive shooters or managing multiple windows during work sessions.</p>



<p>The <strong>aggressive 1000R curve radius comes closer to the natural curvature of human peripheral vision</strong> than, say, gentler curves at 1800R or even flat panels, making for immersive viewing that wraps content around your field of view. That tight curvature puts every part of the screen an equal distance from your eyes when properly positioned, minimising eye movement required to scan across the display while maintaining consistency in focus between centre and edges.</p>
<p>Racing games are dramatically better-the curved display creates peripheral awareness of oncoming corners and competitors. First-person shooters pick up situational awareness with better peripheral enemy detection. The effect of immersion proves most pronounced during longer gaming sessions, where the curved display pulls you into game worlds more effectively than flat monitors do, which maintain psychological distance between viewer and content.</p>



<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion rendering</strong> that eliminates the choppiness plaguing 60Hz displays when the game’s camera pans fast or the character is moving at incredible speeds. In competitive games, high refresh enables reduced motion blur and better target tracking to give you clear views of enemies in movement and quicker reaction capability when events catch you by surprise.</p>
<p>The <strong>response time of 1ms MPRT complements</strong> the high refresh by making sure pixel transitions are done fast enough to prevent ghost trails behind moving objects. FreeSync from AMD Radeon synchronizes display refresh with your GPU’s frame output and removes screen tearing for fluid visuals without the stutter that occurs when refresh and frame rates desync.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 support extends the color range</strong> and contrast ratio beyond what standard dynamic range displays are capable of showing, revealing details in both shadows and highlights that SDR crushes into solid blacks or blown-out whites. Game scenes gain dramatic impact through deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and more saturated colors, making virtual worlds feel more alive and realistic.</p>
<p>At $199, the Samsung Odyssey hits that perfect sweet spot between immersion and practicality for standard desks, while the feature set compares well to premium monitors available for as much as twice the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/an-early-black-friday-shocker-apple-drops-a-749-deal-on-the-m4-macbook-air-at-amazon-2000646931</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-m4-macbook-air-hits-a-margin-free-black-friday-price-but-apple-only-offers-a-small-batch-for-black-friday.1364047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, here’s one we were not expecting on the Monday of Black Friday Week — a massive unannounced deal from Apple, of all companies. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the shocking subject of a huge 25% off deal at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $749</a>. With Apple’s laptop fleet of brand-new M5 models soaking up most of the attention, they’ve decided to sneak in a killer deal on a killer laptop.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the M4 chip makes this MacBook Air a beast for productivity, streaming, multitasking, or pretty much anything else you ask of it. The M4 was built specifically to run Apple Intelligence, and the MacBook Air has all of Apple’s industry-best features like the brilliant 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and 18 hours of battery life. It’s a perfect match for an iPhone, with the real-time mirroring feature that lets you answer calls and texts without having to break stride to reach for your phone, and it’s a seamless pairing with any of the AirPods models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Not New, But Definitely Not Old</h2>
<p>The M4 chip that drives the impeccable performance of the MacBook Air was Apple’s state-of-the-art processor and possibly the best anywhere in the tech world until the M5 dropped just this past October. So you don’t exactly need a time machine to hearken back to the days when the M4 ruled the roost, and the debut of the M5 does not detract one bit from its performance.</p>
<p>The M4 chip is twice as fast as the M1, and a mind-blowing 23 times faster than the last of Apple’s Intel processors. The Neural Engine that’s built into the M4 not only makes Apple Intelligence possible, it makes it run with blazing speed. There’s sufficient processing power for the Air to power up to two external displays with the same fast, fluid performance even for demanding tasks like video editing.</p>



<h2>Multimedia Superstar</h2>
<p>The MacBooks have long been among the very best laptops for connecting remotely for work or pleasure, and the M4 MacBook Air is a great example. The 12MP Center Stage camera ensures you’ll show up on the other end of a video call looking your best, and the MacBook Air’s three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio bolster a pro-level connection. Having Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections eliminates any online glitch-outs to keep the conversation rolling without interruption.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air isn’t one of those laptops with a million ports and jacks for external devices, but what it has — two Thunderbolt 4 ports in addition to its MagSafe charging port and a headphone jack — are top-notch for connecting external monitors or external storage or charging devices.</p>
<p>For a Monday deal during Black Friday Week, this one’s a shocker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">Apple’s 13-inch M4 MacBook Air shedding $250 from its price at Amazon and landing at a record-low $749 was most definitely not on our Bingo card</a>, but it’s real, and it’s potentially one that could cause a supply-draining stampede. We would not recommend sleeping on this one too long.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest year-end questions people have about the gaming industry this year is whether or not Battlefield 6 will outsell Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a feat that would end a 20-year run of Call of Duty's dominance. It remains to be seen if that will happen, and while we wait for the data to come in, Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m65enfy2fk2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some data points</a> about the shooter category in the US.</p><p>To begin with, Piscatella pointed out that the last shooter game to outsell a Call of Duty title in the US over a full year was Gears of War in 2006. The last FPS to beat Call of Duty was Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005.</p><p>Call of Duty has reigned supreme in the US not just in the shooter and FPS categories, but generally as well. A Call of Duty game has finished the year as the best-selling title for 13 of the past 16 years, the exceptions being 2013 (GTA 5), 2018 (Red Dead Redemption II), and 2023 (Hogwarts Legacy).</p><p>"Still have some big weeks of potential sales to come, but this part of the market hasn't been this competitive in 20 years," Piscatella said of the shooter and FPS categories of the gaming market.</p><p>He added that comparing titles over such a long time horizon is imperfect because the gaming market today is much more "dynamic," especially with things like subscription services and free games like Fortnite. This means "sales alone don't tell the whole story."</p><p>Battlefield 6 is already performing better than Call of Duty's latest releases in the US. First-month sales of Battlefield 6 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">higher than any other game's first-month sales going back to 2022</a>, meaning Battlefield 6 sold better out of the gate than 2024's Black Ops 6 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Battlefield 6 needed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380"> just 22 days</a> to eclipse the entire lifetime sales of Battlefield 1 in the US.</p><p>It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">missed out on $300 million+ in revenue for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> because it was on Xbox Game Pass. That doesn't tell the whole story, though, as the Black Ops 6 release no doubt incentivized people to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p>People will want to compare Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, but no comparison between the two would be complete or necessarily fair for a variety of reasons. One is that Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. Another is that Black Ops 7 is releasing on more platforms than Battlefield 6, as Activision's game is supporting last-gen platforms and EA's is not. Yet another element to consider is that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-in-three-days-ea-confirms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 sales are reportedly skewed toward PC.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and in a break from tradition, Activision's celebratory first-weekend post <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any data about how the game is performing</a> compared to past games. Before this, Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-does-worry-about-fatigue-as-black-ops-7-arrives-right-after-black-ops-6/1100-6535019/" data-ref-id="1100-6535019">acknowledged "fatigue" around the Black Ops brand given the back-to-back releases of Black Ops 7 in 2024 and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</a></p><p>Prior to Black Ops 7's release, industry experts said Battlefield 6 didn't have a real chance at beating Black Ops 7, in part because of the size, scale, and momentum of the Call of Duty series. One analyst said people buy Call of Duty every year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">"autopilot purchasing," even if they complain about a lack of new features or innovation.</a></p><p>Circana's report for US sales in November will be released on December 17, so keep checking back with GameSpot to see how Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 sales compare.</p>

            <p>When Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and secondary director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, left CD Projekt Red in 2021, he did so under a dark cloud, accused of workplace bullying. A four month-long external investigation cleared him of any charges but the taint of the accusations linger still.</p>
<p>"It's always difficult," Tomaszkiewicz told me when we met in London last week. "It's always difficult because when stuff like this happens, it's really difficult to show people that it wasn't like this, because people like to assume some things."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-leaves-cd-projekt-following-investigation-into-workplace-bullying">When Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red, he acknowledged in an email</a> that "a lot of people are feeling fear, stress or discomfort when working with me", and he apologised "for all the bad blood I have caused". He promised to work on himself and set about changing his behaviour.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the issue last week, Tomaszkiewicz told me problems seemed to arise when CD Projekt Red grew rapidly in size following the release of The Witcher 3, in 2015. That game was made on average by 160 people, he said - a figure that jumped to 205 closer to release, when the then-small Cyberpunk 2077 team was pulled in to help. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">By the time Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red in 2021</a>, however, there were more than 1000 people working there.</p><p>During Cyberpunk 2077's unwieldy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-new-witcher-game-director-speaks-out-on-crunch">CD Projekt Red became linked with a culture of crunch</a>, but the studio's intense way of working does stretch back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">the beginning of The Witcher series of games</a>, which of course Tomaszkiewicz was a part of. "For half-a-year we were working 12-hour days every day, all weekends, all the time," lead character artist Paweł Mielniczuk once told me while recalling The Witcher 1's development.</p>
<p>In 2017, not long after The Witcher 3 as a project was put to bed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-this-approach-to-making-games-is-not-for-everyone">CD Projekt Red responded to apparent low studio morale by saying, "This approach to making games is not for everyone</a>," so this was clearly an issue before Cyberpunk 2077 development got properly underway. Perhaps it was just a more visible issue when lots of new people joined the company.</p>
<p>Working in teams of that size made it hard to know the people you were working with, Tomaszkiewicz said to me, which made it especially hard for people to pull together during the more strenuous development periods. "The problem was - I was analysing it - that people feel differently when you are anonymous for them because the company is huge and [they don't necessarily know you]. The stress is not comparable to the situation when you work with them arm in arm every day," he said.</p>
<p>"I decided that I want to open my own company and do things differently," he added. "I want to have the maximum amount of people [similar to] how we had it in The Witcher 3, because at that time, I knew everyone, full name and surname, and in our company it's totally the same."</p><p>The company he's referring to is Rebel Wolves, which he co-founded in 2022 alongside a handful of other former CD Projekt Red staff, including writer Jakub Szamalek, artist Bartłomiej Gaweł, animator Tamara Zawada, and a few others from the Polish game development scene.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves currently has 155 people working on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut half-human, half-vampire role-playing game - almost exactly the same number of people that worked on The Witcher 3 for the bulk of its development. Given the studio's heritage, it's no surprise The Blood of Dawnwalker passes more than a passing resemblance to The Witcher games, in tone as well as appearance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">but there are notable and significant differences.</a></p>
<p>"I know everyone," Tomaszkiewicz continued. "I work with them every day, not only to feedback and review their stuff, but doing the stuff with them. I implement the quests, also. I'm scripting the combat and the opponents.</p>
<p>"I want to be the leader not the boss," he said. "I want to work with them and show direction and help them to go in this particular direction, not be somewhere there in Olympus and not have the camaraderie with the people. I want to feel this crazy fire as I felt it in The Witcher 3, The Witcher 2, in The Witcher 1. And later, when the team was too big, I lost it somewhere. And right now I have it back."</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.</p>
<p>The iconic brand has successfully translated their <strong>legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers</strong> that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/"> At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Re-Engineered Soundstage</h2>
<p>The third-generation design expands the <strong>stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models</strong> through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.</p>
<p>The Marshall signature sound <strong>emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character</strong> that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.</p>



<p>Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker <strong>with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementation</strong>&nbsp;which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.</p>
<p>Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional <strong>wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available</strong> for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and y<strong>ou’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box</strong>. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. <strong>The speaker has tactile, analog controls</strong> at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.</p>
<p>The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="519">LEGO is a timeless toy that continues to capture the hearts of people of all ages. It’s not just for kids. Anyone with a sense of nostalgia or creativity can dive into the fun. LEGO has a vast array of collaborations with different fandoms, and perhaps one of its most popular partnerships is with Marvel. Among the many sets inspired by the Marvel universe is one based on the most iconic scene from the second film in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, and its now available at a discounted price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">This particular LEGO set of the Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train showdown typically sells for $55, but it’s currently on sale for 20% off, bringing the price down to $44</a>. This price drop makes it a great deal for any LEGO fan or Spider-Man enthusiast looking to recreate one of the most memorable moments from the early 2000s Spider-Man films.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="519">Most Iconic&nbsp;Spider-Man Moment</h2>
<p data-start="867" data-end="1630">If you were a teenager during the mid-2000s, you probably fondly remember <em data-start="941" data-end="955">Spider-Man 2</em>, the sequel to the 2002 blockbuster. The movie remains a fan favorite and is often cited as the best of the trilogy and even all the Spider-Man film adaptations. Spoilers for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> I guess&nbsp; but, for many, the standout scene from this movie is the subway sequence, where Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man must save a runaway train from crashing. In this scene, Spider-Man, after losing his mask, uses his webs to slow down the train, and in the end, the New York City passengers agree to keep his identity a secret.</p>
<p data-start="1632" data-end="2357">The LEGO set that pays tribute to this unforgettable scene contains 393 pieces and includes not only a detailed train model but also four minifigures: Spider-Man, Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, and Aunt May. Spider-Man comes with two interchangeable heads—one masked and one unmasked—so you can replicate the scene exactly as it happened. The set also features Doc Ock with his four mechanical arms, which are adjustable and can be posed in a variety of ways. Two of the arms are equipped with laser beams, while the other two can attach to the train to create that intense showdown. Though not actually present during this scene in the movie, J. Jonah Jameson and Aunt May are included just to fill out the set. I guess they’re more recognizable than the kid who returns Peter’s mask.</p>


<p data-start="2359" data-end="2692">The completed set measures over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide, making it a perfect size to display once you’ve finished building it. The roof of the train is removable, allowing you to take a closer look at the interior details, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p data-start="3194" data-end="3606" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a Spider-Man fan or simply someone who love to collect LEGO, this set offers a great way to relive a classic moment from the <em data-start="3324" data-end="3338">Spider-Man 2</em> movie. And with the current discount, you can save $11 when bringing home this piece of cinematic history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem features a brand-new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, and the devs recently spoke about how she differs from other protagonists. </p>



<p>Capcom seems to be cooking up a storm with Resident Evil Requiem, and the anticipation is only going higher as the release date draws closer. Recently, the developers revealed during an interview that the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from previous games</a>. Now, the producer has opened up about how Requiem’s Grace is different from other main characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-grace-is-an-ordinary-person-but-is-a-bit-more-used-to-guns">Resident Evil Requiem’s Grace is An Ordinary Person, But is a ‘Bit More Used to Guns’ </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2025/11/we-speak-with-producer-masato-kumazawa-about-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CheckpointGaming</a>, Resident Evil Requiem’s producer Masato Kumazawa was asked to talk about Grace. Kumazawa explained that the whole point is “scaring the players,” and, from his perspective, “she is the most scared or easily prone to being scared protagonist in the series.” The producer added that he wants other players to “be scared with her and enjoy the atmosphere with her,” noting that “she’s an ordinary person.” </p>



<p>However, Requiem’s Grace is an FBI Analyst, which makes her well-versed with guns. At the same time, when comparing characters like Chris and Leon, “they’re not like, ‘Oh, we get a gun, and we start shooting everything,’ or we get to close combat and have no problem.” When talking about ordinary, Kumazawa believes that Ethan is “the most ordinary in terms of just saying normal”; Grace is just a bit more used to guns than he is. </p>



<p>Kumazawa added that Grace is not an expert like Leon or Chris. They aim to make players feel they have limited resources and to have them figure out “what they can do with the limited amount of things that they have.” The game is closer to “classic type of horror survival,” but it’s not all classic as there are “new elements and new weapons in order to make it more fun.”</p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely has at least one DLC in development</a>. Additionally, the upcoming title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to sell better than RE Village</a>.

            <p>Roblox's CEO has called the problem of predators on the platform an "opportunity", as the company updates its safety measures with age verification checks.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">announced back in September</a>, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">Roblox has expanded its age estimation technology</a> to all users wishing to communicate with others. Back in July it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">introduced an AI to estimate a user's age through video selfies</a>, partly in response to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Online Safety Act</a>. This is now required by all users.</p>
<p>Roblox is predominantly used by children and teenagers, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">report last year claimed Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. As a result, the company is taking steps to improve child safety, with AI at its core due to the scale of the platform - over the summer, for instance, hit game Steal a Brainrot had over 25 million concurrent users.</p>
<p>However, this year three US states have filed lawsuits against Roblox over child safety issues - that's Louisiana, Kentucky, and Texas. Further, over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation have been filed in US federal court this year.</p>
<p>In this context, Roblox CEO David Baszucki appeared on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">New York Times podcast Hard Fork</a>, where hosts Casey Newton and Kevin Roose immediately asked him for his thoughts on "the problem of predators on Roblox".</p>
<p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," said Baszucki. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?</p>
<p>"At the scale we're at, 150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward?"</p>
<p>Roblox is indeed working on safety improvements, but it's shocking to hear the CEO of a major gaming platform call pedophilia an "opportunity" as it jeopardises the safety of children.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout the interview Baszucki appears focused more on promoting technological advancements and highlighting the sheer number of users on the platform, rather than the importance of child safety.</p>
<p>After discussing the use of AI filters and age estimation, Baszucki was asked how confident he is these measures are working, considering it would appear predators have found little difficulty in bypassing such measures in the past.</p>
<p>"I don't want to comment on it," Baszucki replied. He added, in a response generally avoiding the question: "It's one of the primary things we're doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It's an interesting industry situation. I would say, we're not waiting for the rest of the industry. We're like, we're always trying to stay ahead of it."</p><p>Baszucki was then asked outright "You don't think you have a problem with predators on the platform?", to which he responded: "I think we're doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning into the future of how this is going to work."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Baszucki also argued the benefits of having open-ended text communication in Roblox, despite potential issues with safety. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox," he said as part of his response. "There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually - I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything - but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with'."</p>
<p>After Baszucki mentioned the "mind-blogging" scale of the platform, the hosts brought up a report from Hindenburg Research that claimed Roblox was "compromising child safety in order to report growth to investors". Baszucki dismissed the allegation.</p>
<p>"Fun," he said. "Let's keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is no longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason."</p>
<p>Eventually, in an effort to avoid further questioning, Baszucki tried to manipulate the hosts into agreeing with his views on AI success, and joked "is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we're doing and you're here to stealthily support it?" He later added: "I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that. So I'm not frustrated, I'm just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus."</p>
<p>Eventually the conversation turned to Polymarket, a crypto-currency prediction platform where users place bets on future events through a blockchain network.</p>
<p>Baszucki, it would appear, is a fan of the platform. And when jokingly asked if he would put a prediction market in Roblox - essentially allowing children to gamble - he said "we would", but noted the need to account for different legislation around the world.</p><p>When the hosts stated this was a "horrible idea", Baszucki replied: "Well, I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for further comment on the interview.</p>
<p>It's a disastrous interview, following other instances from Baszucki. Back in 2024, he told Eurogamer <a href="http://baszucki/">children making money on the platform isn't exploitation but a gift</a>. Then, earlier this year, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">told the BBC parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox</a> if they are "not comfortable" about their in-game safety.</p>

<p>Square Enix and PlatinumGames' sci-fi ARPG has long been sitting in a pretty bad way on Switch 2, with many users reporting frequent crashes when trying to get it up and running on the new hardware. A glance at <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-GB/details/010056b015fe8000">Nintendo's compatibility information site</a> <em>before</em> today listed NieR: Automata as "Unsupported - Problems with game progression have been found", but that all seems to be in the rear-view as of system update 21.0.1.</p><div><figure data-videoid="O4v-ia_qhCE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytO4v-ia_qhCE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4v-ia_qhCE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405204gtvurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>As of 25th November 2025 (that's today), the game's listing has been updated as "supported" on Switch 2, with the note that "previously identified issues have been fixed".</p>
<p>It's a welcome change, because NieR: Automata <em>ruled</em> on Switch 1, and now we have the perfect excuse to dive in all over again. In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/nierautomata-the-end-of-yorha-edition">our 9/10 review</a> of the initial Switch release, we described Automata as "a top-notch port that has clearly been produced with respect and focus, often surpassing our expectations in both visuals and performance". *<em>Sigh</em>* as if we didn't already have enough backlog games to get through before the year is up...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360%C2%B0-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams.1363939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Insta360 has stolen market share from GoPro and DJI in recent years as it transformed from an upstart challenger into the definitive action camera brand that content creators and adventure people reach for first. It’s been the combination of innovative <strong>360-degree capture, AI-powered editing and useful features</strong> like the invisible selfie stick effect that positioned Insta360 as the company pushing boundaries while established competitors iterated incrementally.</p>
<p>The X5 launched in April as its feature-packed flagship model justifying the premium positioning, but this Black Friday brings the first significant discount: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/">At $464, down from $549, this 8K 360-degree camera has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon and delivers everything that made Insta360 the action camera leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K Resolution That Captures Everything</h2>
<p>The dual 1/1.28-inch sensors work together to <strong>capture 8K resolution at 30fps across the full 360-degree field of view</strong> for footage that has incredible detail and survives aggressive cropping and reframing in post with ease. This resolution counts because 360-degree cameras need excess capture area so you can choose your framing after the fact rather than commit to an angle at the time of recording. These larger sensors also improve on low-light performance, color accuracy, and dynamic range compared to the smaller sensors on competing action cameras and turn out footage that looks professional.</p>



<p>This game-changing, t<strong>riple AI chip design distributes processing across specialized silicon for real-time noise reduction, image processing, and AI-assisted features</strong> – all operating concurrently without thermal throttling or performance compromise. But this architecture really lets you fly when shooting in tough low-light conditions that leave competitors’ cameras producing unusable grainy footage, delivering clean video even during those golden hours, indoor scenes, or nighttime adventures. Advanced features such as auto subject-tracking, horizon leveling, and smart reframing-all using AI to analyze 360-degree footage for ideal crop point suggestions that capture the action-are powered by onboard AI processing.</p>
<p>The<strong> invisible selfie stick effect is Insta360’s signature feature</strong> which creates impossible third-person perspectives that make it seem like a drone or cameraman is following you. It captures 360 degrees of everything, including the extended selfie stick, which the stitching algorithm intelligently removes from the final footage via geometric analysis and image processing. That gives you the cinematic shots you dream of: a floating camera tracking your movements in places that feel professionally filmed but are completely self-operated.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization combined with 360-degree Horizon Lock eliminates the need for gimbals through computational stabilization, analyzing motion and then correcting it through post-processing. Stabilization handles aggressive movements, bumps, crashes, and full camera rotations while maintaining level, smooth footage that looks professionally stabilized. The horizon lock specifically ensures the horizon line stays perfectly level regardless of how the camera tumbles or rotates during action sequences, preventing the disorienting tilted footage that ruins otherwise great action shots.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens system is a practical innovation in itself as it protects your investment by allowing quick lens swaps the moment scratches, cracks, or damage occur. Traditional action cameras require expensive repairs or an outright replacement when lenses get damaged in crashes, drops, or impacts that inevitably occur during action sports. The <strong>X5’s lenses detach and replace in mere seconds</strong> without requiring tools, thus enabling one to take spare lenses along on extended trips or adventures where lens damage becomes likely.</p>
<p>The <strong>advanced 4-microphone array</strong> captures clearer audio by first reducing the amount of wind interference that usually ruins action camera soundtracks. It does this through several microphones placed strategically around the camera body, combined with AI processing that identifies and suppresses wind noise while preserving voice and ambient sounds.</p>
<p>At $464, the Insta360 X5 brings 8K 360-degree video, triple AI chip processing, invisible selfie stick compatibility, FlowState stabilization, replaceable lenses, and enhanced wind reduction at 15% off retail this Black Friday. Insta360 remains the market leader over GoPro and DJI not because of incremental spec bumps but rather through relentless innovation in features that actually matter to content creators.</p>

              <p>Now is a great time to upgrade your tech for less. Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are coming in hot. Those looking to grab a new laptop this shopping season, whether for themselves or a loved one, should consider bagging the heavily discounted 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3530 at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">This machine typically retails for around $4,000, but Amazon is offering it at a whopping 80% discount, which brings the down to just $798.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a Redragon keyboard and mouse kit for absolutely nothing. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you’re saving on that front as well.</p>
<p>The only catch? This deal, at the time of writing, is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members will still see it at its normal, not-so-friendly $4,000 tag. That said, if you’re planning to shop heavy during the main event, now is a good time to jump on a Prime membership. It lets you enjoy fast, free shipping with your purchases, access member-only deals, and unlock early discounts. The retailer offers a 30-day free trial to new users. After that, you can expect to pay around $15 a month.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete, Ready-to-Go Setup</h2>
<p>In a fairly minimal design, the laptop offers a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen. 220 nits of brightness push clear, vibrant visuals, while the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. Touch support makes navigation a breeze. Not in the mood to use the trackpad or drag the mouse around? Just use your fingers directly on the screen to perform tasks. Pinch for a wider view, stretch to zoom in, swipe away, scroll long documents, or maybe use the on-screen keyboard to take notes; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Just above the screen is a solid 720p HD webcam that makes it easy to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external camera.</p>
<p>This machine runs on the updated 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor, which handles both everyday school and work tasks like a pro. The chip is paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM for snappier multitasking, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for quicker boot times. You’ll be able to perform a whole bunch of tasks (researching, writing, taking video calls) simultaneously without a hint of lag, which makes the laptop ideal for creatives who need to hop through different programs at the same time. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of space to store your important data, whether it’s hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, or unusually large research papers. The capacity should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re looking to house ever-growing libraries of media files without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Connectivity options are plenty. You’ll enjoy a stable, wireless connection with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, plus be able to connect a range of external peripherals using the built-in ports. Speaking of peripherals, the free kit gets you a solid Redragon laptop keyboard and mouse. The former is quite lightweight and comes with detachable keys. The mouse has a sturdy feel, and is quite comfortable to use for longer sessions.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, meaning you don’t have to worry about any complicated installation procedures to get started. Microsoft has loaded the operating system with a bunch of useful productivity and security features that are ideal for remote workers, business owners, creatives, and even students. Just note that Microsoft Office isn’t included, and you will need to purchase it separately later if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">Overall, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen laptop is a great option to consider for both work and play, especially at its current price. You’re saving more than $3,200 on this powerhouse.</a> Grab the deal before it’s too late.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona"><u>Persona</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio"><u>Metaphor: ReFantazio</u></a> director Katsura Hashino claims Japanese role-playing games — often categorized as JRPGs — are entering a new age, dubbing the resurgence as JRPG "3.0."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking at the Korean G-Star 2025 gaming conference (as reported by <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/714/G071477/20251114074/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>4gamer</u></a> and translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-says-he-wants-to-create-jrpg-3-0-fundamentally-changing-the-genres-structure-and-presentation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar+</u></a>), Hashino suggested that the foundational RPGs — think "true classics" like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest"><u>Dragon Quest</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy"><u>Final Fantasy</u></a>, although Hashinon did not mention specific games — form JRPG 1.0, the current crop of games with their "current style, which feels higher quality due to how much more responsive they are to the player," are JRPG 2.0. And JRPG 3.0 signifies the role-playing games coming in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the JRPG games still to come, Hashino said, "There will be a greater dimension to these games, and they'll change the genre's structure and presentation at a fundamental level."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big talking points around JRPGs revolves around combat, specifically if games like Final Fantasy should return to the turn-based combat of old. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> co-director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-may-suggest-jrpgs-are-back-but-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-co-director-is-focused-on-what-game-experience-fans-will-enjoy"><u>Naoki Hamaguchi recently reflected on features like turn-based combat</u></a> following the huge success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, which boasts traditional JRPG-inspired turn-based combat, saying: "If you would ask me, 'Is [my next game] going to be an RPG?,' yes, there is definitely a possibility. But is it going to be a turn-based RPG? We're taking this aside from the fact that Expedition 33 was received well, we received a lot of 'JRPGs are back' comments. For me, I'm thinking about what game experience fans will enjoy. That's the most important point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-developers-visited-square-enixs-offices-for-a-rich-exchange-of-ideas">It later emerged that several members of the Clair Obscur team had recently visited Square Enix's offices</a> and met with some of the development leads there, including Hamaguchi and <a href="https://x.com/YoshidaBeer/status/1948371688338424076" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida</a>. <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a social post</a>, Hamaguchi described it as a "creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1975924077496852782" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>five million copies in five months</u></a>, making it one of the biggest hits of the year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-xm6-headphones-hit-an-all-time-low-for-black-friday-as-amazon-clears-the-warehouse.1363900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="304">Music truly comes to life when you experience it with a high-quality pair of headphones. One of the best in the market today is Sony’s flagship noise-canceling model, the WH-1000XM5. Known for their exceptional sound and comfort, these headphones offer a premium listening experience that’s hard to match. Currently, they’re available at a great price as one of Amazon’s early Black Friday deals, with discount of $62 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">Normally priced at $460, the platinum silver, black, and midnight blue versions are now reduced by 13%, bringing them down to just $398.</a></p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.</p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="685" data-end="1266">Cancel Out the World Around You</h2>
<p data-start="1268" data-end="1700">A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.</p>
<p data-start="1702" data-end="2038">The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplified—even in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded café or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.</p>


<p data-start="2040" data-end="2685">In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. They’re lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, don’t stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playback—enough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="3100" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.</a></p>
