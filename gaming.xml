			<p>There’s been many times where I’ve uttered the words “this is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.” It happened when I first played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a> as I rode a horse across empty plains, unbothered by enemies as I approached a giant, moving, climbing puzzle. It happened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/10/superliminal-review-ps4-xbox-switch/">Superliminal</a> twisted my mind into confusing shapes as I tried to understand its perspective-based puzzles. It even happened when I saw a trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/17/genital-jousting-is-a-wonderfully-silly-looking-game-and-a-bit-nsfw/">Genital Jousting</a>. Now it’s happened for possible the final time. Why? Because Blippo+ is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blippo+ | Switch and Steam Release Date Trailer | Coming Sept 23rd" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f69DgOfBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technically speaking, Blippo+ isn’t even a traditional game. It’s more of a 90s television simulator… now in colour! There’s no on-demand streaming here, it’s a programme guide complete with multiple TV channels to switch between. After the original “1-bit” release in black and white on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playdate/">Playdate</a>, this PC and Switch version now brings more of an analogue TV aesthetic, right down to the artifacting and fuzzy video quality. And I do mean video quality, as it’s live action video of actual actors doing actual acting, but it’s all unerringly presented in the style of television from three decades ago. It’s actually incredibly impressive how perfectly they’ve nailed this aesthetic – using Blippo+ is basically indistinguishable from actual television back then, right down to scanning for channels.</p>


<p>Well, almost. You won’t find reruns of Friends, Fresh Prince or Star Trek Voyager here, because this is television from another planet, called Planet Blip. This is explained through the TV shows themselves, with one news segment explaining that a planet somewhere off in space seems to have activated devices called PeeDees that can receive the television signal from Planet Blip due to a fold in space. A PeeDee is apparently a smartphone-type device that is ubiquitous on Blip. It took a moment for me to realise that the planet they were referring to was Earth, and that my/our playing of this game is a part of its story. I am not sure if I mentioned this yet, but Blippo+ is weird.</p>


<p>Planet Blip seems to be caught in some kind of sci-fi 90s fashion vortex, with everyone having era appropriate clothing, makeup, and hairstyles… if they were appearing in Doctor Who. The TV shows are, if anything, weirder than you’re expecting. One show is a cooking show that shows you how to prepare alien fruit, complete with a cooking show voiceover explaining what to do and some good alien fruit props. Another is a scientist who can revive people from their DNA and is using it to conduct interviews that are a bit insulting, but very unsympathetic to the horrors of suddenly being revived long after your own death. Bushwalker is a first person view of walking through the great outdoors, with two hands holding a knife and a wooden axe moving at the sides of the screen. Then there’s Tantric Computing, which is on the “porn” channel which is all scrambled, but images keep making it through of a keyboard being softly stroked, a cable being inserted, or a (computer) mouse being handled whilst soft moans play in the background.</p>
<p>It’s just about the most surreal thing I’ve ever experienced. Hundreds of people worked on this – writers, actors, graphic designers, musicians, editors – and it’s a stunningly odd achievement. I do believe they’ve nailed what they wanted to do, from the aesthetic, to the vaguely self aware nature of the performances, the creativity on show, it all seems pretty much perfect for the niche I have to assume this is aimed at: drama kids, weirdos like me that watch too much Dropout TV, and fans of shows with rich veins of overly meta humour.</p>

<p>The problem is, I imagine for a general audience it all kind of blends together after a while. It’s pretty hit and miss at the best of times, but the constant stream of irreverent weirdness means it lacks the variety to keep me actually engaged. If some channels did things that took themselves seriously, others did comedy stuff, other did chat shows, there would be stuff to switch between. Back when linear TV was still the norm in my life, I wouldn’t channel surf to find things of the exact same tone as what I was already watching, I’d be looking for something different. That’s the whole point of changing the channel. Here you just hop from weird to weird, so the novelty of that runs out far too quickly. If some of the programming took itself more seriously, at least in the way that something like Tommy Wiseau’s The Room does, then the variety would go a long way.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, the programmes themselves are all very short as well, perhaps up to a minute long. This makes sense, but it also limits their depth and impact – they’re over so quickly that they become transient, there’s no ads or pauses between them to leave a moment to sit with the end of a show and react to it. Of course, the constant barrage of advertisements are a scourge on humanity, but at least in the olden days when the younger generations still watched live TV they did provide a pause to reflect on what you’ve just seen, react to it, discuss it, or at least go to make a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Kickstarter goal smashed</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Accessory maker Retro Fighters has smashed its newest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/brawler64-pro-series-n64-wireless-controller">Kickstarter campaign</a> for the <strong>Brawler64 Pro Series Edition</strong>. A mouthful, to be sure, but the pad itself actually looks pretty neat.</p>
<p>With compatibility confirmed for the Switch and Switch 2 alongside the original N64, the new Brawler64 Pro (we'll just leave it at that going forward) features Hall Effect joysticks, a tactile d-pad with Kailh switches, back buttons (which you can lock if you wish), adjustable vibration, and magnetic customisable faceplates (which, we should note, is currently locked behind the $50K stretch goal).</p>
<p>The pads themselves will come in six colours, including Classic Gray, Watermelon, Extreme Green, Turquoise, Atomic Purple, and Smoke Black. With the added faceplates, however, you'll be able to mix and match your favourite colour combinations whenever you wish.</p>
<p>It's a nice little upgrade to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/hardware_review_retro_fighters_brawler64_controller_-_a_crowdfunded_upgrade_to_your_battered_original">original Brawler64</a> and should prove to be a competent competitor against <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/64-controller/">8BitDo's Analogue 64 controller</a>.</p>
<p>There are still about two weeks to go until the Kickstarter ends for the Brawler64 Pro, so if you're keen on grabbing one of these, you can grab one for <strong>£47 / $63</strong>. Additional pledge tiers are also available if you're looking to purchase multiple controllers.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-ue5-blam-engine-gameplay-tweaks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-combat-evolved-remake-is-rumored-to-use-ue5-and-blam-engine-add-gameplay-tweaks.1311280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">supposedly launching next year</a> is reportedly going to use a hybrid engine setup with Unreal Engine 5 and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine, as well as modern gameplay features and tweaked level design.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming"> Rebs Gaming</a>, who proved their reliability in the past by reporting correct information before official announcements, such as the launch date for Halo Infinite multiplayer component, reported some new details on the rumored remake, relied by an unnamed source who received it from a developer who works for a co-development studio which has previously worked with 343 Industries on the Halo: The Master Chief Collection and is now handling a lot of the remake's core development.</p>



<p>According to the new information, the current Halo Combat Evolved remake build features sprinting, which is not available in the original. Although the introduction of a modern FPS gameplay mechanic can be divisive, its inclusion would be hardly surprising, considering series co-creator Marcus Lehto talked about more contemporary core mechanics that improve gameplay among features of a potential remake that would enhance the original experience. Regarding gameplay, the remake is said to feature tweaked level design for maps like The Library.</p>



<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake will also reportedly be powered by two engines like this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, using Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay logic and world systems. This setup would ensure modern visuals and faithful gameplay, although using UE5 for graphics could lead to performance issues, as we have seen time and time again in way too many games released in the past few months, especially if <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">optimization work is not done properly, as suggested by Epic CEO last month</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming has proved to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new information, and even the development of a Halo Combat Evolved remake, with a grain of salt. Thankfully, it shouldn't take much longer to learn if the game is really in development, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo Studios will reveal the future of the series at HaloWC 2025 next month.</a></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been over half a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-next-patch-come-with-first-bits-dlc-team-folon-celebrates-becoming-registered-business">announced that it'd be getting three bits of DLC</a> adding new quests to post-apocalyptic Blighty. The folks behind the massive mod have been relatively quiet in that time, but they've now confirmed that the first of these DLCs, Rabbit and Pork, will require you to start a fresh save game.</p>
<p>Also, one reason it hasn't arrived already is that the team have been working to ensure other quest add-ons won't force you to go back to square one, whenever they drop.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC is a DLC in name only really, it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content," Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter wrote on Team FOLON's<a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1233281020376252417/1421047996292005960">Discord server</a> over the weekend, in response to a user asking if they'd have to start over again when the DLC arrives. "So, it'll require a new save. One of the reasons it's also [taken] so long was ensuring any future groundwork for other quests in other DLCs won't require the new game save."</p>
<p>A fresh save being mandatory for at least the first of the three Fallout: London DLCs isn't a huge surprise. Since the mod first started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">updates and patches to fix bugs</a> last year, Team FOLON's advice for the best experience has been to start a new game each time a new version arrives, with carrying on from an established one being doable, but potentially leading you to run into "compatibility issues".</p><p>The possibility of messing with saves was what led the modders to roll Fallout: London's bug-fixing version 1.03 patch, originally teased late last year, into this upcoming first DLC. Given that, it's really encouraging to hear the modders have been working on ways to minimise the impact future updates'll have in this regard, since starting over in such a huge game every time it gets updated is far from ideal.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from this first DLC, Rabbit and Pork, Team FOLON's 2D art lead Emily ‘Saffron-rice’ Kemp wrote in a Discord exchange with another fan immediately following Carter's that DLC number one will include "various new side quests of different sizes, but no main quest content".</p>
<p>We do know that extra main questing will be coming in Fallout: London's third DLC, Wildcard, which looks to be the final one the modders have planned at the moment. As Carter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">revealed in an interview with me for my old home</a> last year, that DLC'll add in a whole New Vegas-style wild card arc for the game's main quest, which'll let you decide the fate of London without having to side with the three established main quest factions: Angel, Camelot, and the Fifth Column. This questline was originally intended to be in the base game, but had to be cut after the modder taking the lead on it was, in Carter's words, "basically forcibly conscripted" into the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>That leaves the second DLC, Last Orders, which very much looks pub-themed based on its name and the accompanying art. I'll be keen to give each of them a go, and all the better if I can get away without starting fresh three or four times in the process.</p>

<p>That's according to a handful of fans who were lucky enough to attend <a href="https://zurichpopcon.ch/en">Zurich Pop Con</a> over the weekend, where Nintendo of Europe held a pretty sizeable booth. The NoE Switch 2 area was home to all of the banners we're used to seeing at these kinds of events (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, you get the picture), but it also housed a display featuring <em>five</em> different LEGO games, all under the S2 logo.</p>
<p>As showcased on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOGameMuseum/status/1971875743866277955">Twitter</a> by <a href="https://x.com/LEGOGameMuseum" tabindex="-1">@LEGOGameMuseum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_city_undercover">LEGO City: Undercover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_harry_potter_collection">LEGO Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_dc_super-villains">LEGO DC Super-Villains</a> all featured on the Switch 2 banner. Importantly, none of these have been officially given Switch 2 Edition releases... <em>yet</em>.</p>

<p>A blurred banner photo is far from a hard fact, but <a href="https://x.com/LegoGamesNews" tabindex="-1">@LegoGamesNews</a> has been sharing <a href="https://x.com/LegoGamesNews/status/1971997217948160071">other images</a> of the marketing from different angles, and it sure seems to be the real deal.</p>
<p>Of course, we'll still be treating everything with a pinch of salt until LEGO and TT Games make it official. This wouldn't be the first piece of Switch 2 marketing with incorrect info on it — we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Prime 4</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">'Out Now' poster</a> — but it's an exciting concept all the same. Heck, any excuse to replay The Skywalker Saga is a welcome one, if you ask us.</p>
<p>Until we hear any official word on this, the Switch 2's first franchise LEGO game is set to launch next year when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> swoops our way at some point in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game developers have often criticized the Xbox Series S for its lower specifications, which made ports troublesome, but there have also been a few voices claiming the contrary. Recently, Ripple Effect <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Battlefield 6 was better optimized due to the development team's work to optimize the game for Microsoft's less expensive Xbox console.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Windows Central</a>, Square Enix's programmer and director Naoki Hamaguchi has now said that the Xbox Series S has solid specs and his team did not encounter many issues with the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade port, except for the memory (the Series S has only 10GB of RAM).</p>



<p><em>In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec. We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related. Optimization is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gained Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade port is coming to Xbox Series S and X as well as Nintendo Switch 2 on January 22, 2026. They also added that the whole trilogy will eventually be available on all main platforms (including PlayStation 5 and PC, of course). We don't know yet when Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will launch on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2. We also do not know whether the third chapter in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will launch simultaneously for all these consoles or still as a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive, as was the case with the first two installments.</p>

IGN has contacted Epic Games for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, fan response to the emote being pulled has been mixed, with some acknowledging the potential for the "Nazi emote," as it's been dubbed, to subsequently be misused by players to grief others. Others, however, have questioned why Epic Games has acted here but not in other similar situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Fortnite recently raised eyebrows by adding the Tylil Dance, an emote collaboration with rapper Kai Cenat which features music by Kanye West. West, who now refers to himself as Ye, previously made numerous comments deemed to be anti-semitic and in 2022 said he identified as "a Nazi." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example, Fortnite has notably shied away from reselling an in-game skin, Rue, whose costume players widely likened to the design of a Nazi uniform. The skin remains within the game, though is now one of Fortnite's rarest — as Epic Games has chosen not to sell it in over five years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Peacemaker's latest episode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-answers-our-burning-questions-about-peacemakers-explosive-sixth-episode-and-why-that-cameo-is-consequential-to-the-dcu">IGN recently chatted with Gunn about the show</a> and its other big surprise, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemaker-season-2s-big-dcu-cameo-revealed-in-episode-6">cameo by Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new PlayStation 5 CFI-2100 model <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/">released in Europe this month</a> may have a smaller SSD, but it introduces some welcome improvements, including one for a well-known <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">critical liquid metal cooling issue that has damaged plenty of systems already.</a></p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> takes a good look at the new hardware revision of Sony's current generation console, highlighting some changes over the previous models besides the inclusion of an 825 GB SSD over the 1 TB SSD of previous version of the system, which is a considerable downgrade for the Digital Edition of the system considering how much storage space games require nowadays.</p>



<p>The first notable change is purely aesthetic. The design of the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision remains identical to the current Slim design, but without the glossy finish. Although minimal, some may prefer this look, which is more in line with the launch models regarding the faceplates.</p>



<p>Every other change over the previous model is internal. Among the most notable changes are the inclusion of more NAND modules, three over the two of the earlier models, and ridges for the liquid metal cooling solution like those seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">PlayStation 5 Pro. </a></p>



<p>This addition is extremely welcome, as without those ridges, liquid metal can drip down if the console is placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU, which can heavily compromise its functionality. Despite having had my launch model vertically since day one, I never had any of these issues as others did, so not every older model is affected by this problem. Still, these ridges are welcome additions that should ensure these systems stay functional longer.</p>



<p>The above changes are only some the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision offers. You can learn more about the reduced weight of the system and its better efficiency in the full teardown below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new base PlayStation 5 hardware revision, whose release in the United States is still uncertain, is reportedly being followed by a PlayStation 5 Pro revision. Little is known about this new model, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">changes are expected to be minimal.</a></p>

            <p>Battlefield, EA Sports FC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> publishers Electronic Arts are holding "advanced talks" to go private with a valuation of $50 billion after 35 years as a public company, according to reports this weekend.
</p>
<p>If rumour breathe true, the buyers are a group of investors that include private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Affinity Partners, the Saudi-backed investment firm founded by Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The report comes via the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, the latter of whom cite "sources familiar with the matter". They claim that if the deal goes through, it could happen this week.
</p>
<p><em>If</em> the deal does happen, it will mean that BioWare, Criterion Games, DICE, Motive Studio, and Respawn Entertainment are now partly overseen by the investment arm of a state that oppresses women and queer people, executes journalists and imprisons political dissenters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> developers may find the prospect especially unwelcome, given the focus their games place on diverse casts.

<p>Reuters frame the investments as part of Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030" strategy to diversify the Kingdom's heavily oil-reliant economy. The PIF were rumoured to be discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">a $2 billion investment deal</a> via their subsidiary Savvy Games with the infamously acquisition-happy Embracer Group some years ago. These talks reportedly fell through in May 2023, triggering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">a brutal period of mass layoffs and cancellations</a>. 
</p>
<p>More recently, the PIF acquired Scopely, US publishers of licensed games like Marvel Strike Force and the current developers of Pokemon Go. They have also funded the creation of a new Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in the historic city of AlUla, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">prompting internal criticism from Ubisoft developers</a>.
</p><p>In addition to investing in games publishers, the PIF have poured a lot of money into esports, acquiring companies and hosting tournaments in what has been widely styled a case of 'sportswashing' <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">the Kingdom's abysmal human rights record</a>. Earlier this month, the Public Investment Fund-backed company Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">became co-owner of fighting game tournament Evo</a>. Savvy Games already own ESL FACEIT Group, a merger of two esports organisers, who are organising next year's much-trumpeted Esports World Cup in Riyadh.
</p>
<p>As for the other two investment groups who are allegedly party to the EA deal, Silver Lake are a 1999-founded firm who once owned Skype, and who have also sunk a few doubloons into game engine company Unity and PC manufacturer Dell. Affinity Partners were founded by Kushner in 2021, and have received billions from the PIF, with Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman personally intervening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">push the investment through</a>. Kushner is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kushner-has-discussed-us-saudi-diplomacy-with-saudi-crown-prince-2024-10-04/">the subject of scrutiny</a> as to whether his Saudi partnerships have influenced his work in the US government.</p>
<p>The rumoured EA buyout would continue the past decade's consolidation of game developers and publishers in the hands of a select few megacorporations. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">completed their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year</a>, adding Call of Duty, Diablo and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> to the Xbox haggis. The world's largest videogame publisher, Tencent, have scooped up big outfits like Riot Games, Sumo Group and Funcom, while acquiring majority stakes or sizeable minority shares in the likes of Epic, Krafton and Paradox Interactive. Tencent recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funnelled a huge reservoir of money into Ubisoft</a> as part of the latter's wider corporate restructuring to focus on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six.
</p>
<p>EA have <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ea-sports-apex-legends-sales-electronic-arts-earnings-1236473474/">seen "better-than-expected" revenue growth</a> lately, but they've had some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">significant disappointments</a> in the past year or two, and are currently betting rather a lot on Battlefield 6, with executives allegedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">hell-bent on attracting 100 million players</a>. Whatever their current fortunes, it seems plausible that layoffs will follow any buyout, as the new overlords seek to 'optimise' their investment.
</p>
<p>I'll wire EA a request for comment.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launch title finds itself in third this week, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> grabbing the gold and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill F</a> taking silver. All of this mix-up at the top means <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> hasn't been able to nab a podium spot in its debut chart appearance, checking in at fourth, with the Switch 1 accounting for 30% of its sales.</p>
<p>Oh yes, and if you wanted even more newbies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> came out to play this week and landed in 14th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4’s first of two new Vault Hunters coming to the game as part of the paid Story Pack DLCs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH, due out during the first quarter of 2026, is a playable character whose luck-based powers can make him either the best or worst character in the game, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a panel at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb, from Gearbox:</p><blockquote>A former casino dealer bot, C4SH is now a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts. As luck would have it, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favor.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH has three unique Action Skills to choose from, as you’d expect, and three skill trees that each have three branches full of passives and other customization options. C4SH works differently to the other Vault Hunters, however, by having unpredictable Action Skills. Gearbox said they all involve an element of chance as part of a risk-reward playstyle that “can lead to good fortunes like buffing himself and allies, dealing devastating damage, sapping the strength from foes, and more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the panel, Pitchford revealed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card Action Skill, which has big Gambit vibes. Pitchford, a professional magician himself, said C4SH was “very dear to me, very personal to me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of chance, with luck he can be the most powerful Vault Hunter in the game. But of course, with bad luck it’s the opposite. The gameplay with cash is definitely high risk, high reward. I think it’s a lot of fun. It makes my heart pound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common. Some of you might not know this, but I have played poker professionally, as a gambler. I have appeared on a live reality television show in America about playing Texas Hold'em Poker. And I’ve felt what it’s like to take risks and to have that work out and have extreme success from chance, but also to miss out and lose my money.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/28/g15shqnamaaijsr-1759090620762.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">C4SH is due out Q1 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Another thing some of you may know about me is that in addition to being a game developer, I’m a professional magician. And I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford proceeded to show behind-the-scenes footage of the developer in his office at the Texas studio palming, flicking, and throwing playing cards from a first-person perspective, footage he said the animators used to help animate C4SH. Pitchford then showed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card action skill alongside first-person footage of himself performing the card actions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">IN GAME ANIMATION FOR C4SH'S CARD ACTION SKILL<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Borderlands4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Borderlands4</a> <a href="https://t.co/R59KmkhFrZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/R59KmkhFrZ</a></p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1972135452221362439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll get C4SH as soon as he’s available by owning the Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, the Vault Hunter Pack (included in Super Deluxe Edition), or Story Pack 1: Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned (included in Vault Hunter Pack).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, meanwhile, adds multiple main and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, new gear to earn, and new cosmetics as well as C4SH.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched this month with four playable characters: Vex; Rafa; Amon, and Harlowe.

            <p>Silent Hill is doing good business for Konami at the moment. The just-released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> is off to an even stronger start, sales wise, than the widely acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> released last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">Konami announced today</a> that worldwide shipments of Silent Hill f have passed 1m units - a figure that includes shipments of packaged versions of the game and downloaded versions sold. That figure was recorded by Konami on 26th September, a day after the game's release (25th September).</p>

And together with the quality of the recent Silent Hill games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f received a hearty four-stars in our review</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">the Silent Hill 2 Remake received five stars in our review</a> - they combine to create something of a renaissance effect for the iconic horror series. Which, in more plain terms, I expect means "there's more to come".</p>

			<p>EA heard all our complaints about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. I and many others lamented that last year’s game was far too similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and was lacking major changes, and it certainly feels like EA took note of this. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>, then, comes with some changes that do make it play differently to the previous FC games, though a lot of familiarity (and poor defending) remains.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Official Launch Trailer | The Club is Yours" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2Q4xrASt94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The big change in FC 26 is the addition of Authentic and Competitive gameplay styles, split between the single player and multiplayer sides of the game. Authentic mode is designed to recreate the proper action on the pitch, getting closer to what you would see in a real life match, making things a bit slower and more focused on tactical play rather than sprinting to goal and shooting. That’s the competitive mode and is for online play so matches move quickly and players can go end-to-end while chasting scoring opportunities.</p>


<p>If you are going to play the single player modes, I’d recommend at least playing on World Class difficulty for a real world and authentic feel. Teams act a bit more like their real life counterparts adhering to their tactical shapes and instructions. At Professional difficulty and below, it is too &nbsp;easy to break through opposition defences and have scorelines getting near double digits, which does get boring after a while. It is a continuing issue through the franchise where defending play is just non-existent outside of the higher difficulties, and it is something that I would hope would be looked at. Beating Fulham 9-0 and then Brentford 8-1 a week later as Chelsea on Professional difficulty should just not be happening.</p>


<p>Manager Career and Player Career will remain the two go-to options for single player. Like the previous entry you can choose a real manager or player to play as or create your own – shoutout to Mehdi Leris of Pisa who was the real life player I chose after picking a team at random team. While there is not much difference as a player, EA has tried to refresh the managerial side with unexpected events that can impact the team and individual players. These can range from the coach getting to the ground late so your players don’t have much time to warm up, impacting their sharpness, and can go to the extreme of players getting career ending injuries leading them to retire. You never know when an unexpected event will happen – it’s kind of in the name – which does make career mode a bit more unpredictable.</p>
<p>The youth team is once again an integral part of career, where you can play as them in tournaments and create development plans. There is quite a bit of depth to objectives and player development, but do not expect something on par with Football Manager. You can also pick Live points to start the seasons with, with real life results from the season so far added in already.</p>

<p>Outside of Career is Ultimate Team, Squad Battles, Rush, Clubs and regular online matches for those who want to face off against the world. It is in these online matches where you will be playing with the faster paced Competitive setting. There have been some changes to Ultimate team with the addition of Live events, allowing players to face off against each in varied match settings. There is also the new tournament and gauntlet feature, with tournaments running at different points of the season instead of every week. In Gauntlet, you play a run of five matches but in each successive match you need to swap your players around, essentially giving them every player in your club a run out. It is probably best to save those gold players for the latter stages.</p>

<p>Another new thing is the ability to now evolve goalkeepers, which was oddly missing from FC 25. Your online enjoyment obviously depends on the rest of the player base, but in Ultimate Team there are already squads consisting of the best players where people have invested to get them, though there are challenges that will only allow you to use certain ranked players to get people to play with more varied squads.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		EA Sports FC 26 is a better game than FC 25 and can give you a good game of football, especially when Authentic mode in single player comes together properly. However, for that to happen you need to play on World Class difficulty, as anything below that exposes poor defending by the AI. There has been evolution here, but FC 26 is still only a step towards getting the balance right, and not the final stop.	</p></div>

<p>Or... a re-remaster?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios has announced yet another remaster for release later this year on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> (which, as a reminder, clashes with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>).</p>
<p>Confirmed for "PC and consoles", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blood_refreshed_supply">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is an updated version of the studio's 2019 remaster, <strong>Blood: Fresh Supply</strong>, which itself was a remaster of, uh, <strong>Blood</strong>. The original game launched in 1997 and was developed by the now-defunct Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>This new version benefits from a bunch of added extras, including add-ons Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, new Marrow and Death Wish missions, behind-the-scenes content revealing key development details, and more.</p>
<p>But of course, just having this on the Switch is pretty cool in itself, and it's also been confirmed that a Switch 2 version will be arriving in 2026. Presumably this will boast the 4K/120fps performance seen on the other platforms, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- The legendary blood-soaked shooter</strong> comes to consoles for the very first time!</p>
<p><strong>- Up to 4K 120FPS visuals</strong> on PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</p>
<p><strong>- Fully customizable</strong> keyboard and controller gamepad support</p>
<p><strong>- Extended modding support</strong>, including support for existing mods</p>
<p><strong>- Local split-screen and cross-platform online multiplayer</strong> support for up to eight players — co-op, PvP Bloodbath”, and classic 4v4 team-based “Capture The Flag” modes</p>
<p><strong>- CD and MIDI</strong> music support</p>
<p><strong>- Includes existing add-ons</strong> Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage</p>
<p><strong>- New mission scenarios</strong>, Marrow and Death Wish, pump new blood into… <em>Blood</em>! Marrow will be available at launch, while Death Wish will release as a free post-launch update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds and its immediate predecessors Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise will drop Windows 10 support next month, CAPCOM confirmed today.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777?l=english">new message on Steam</a> today, the Japanese publisher confirmed that starting October 14, 2025, CAPCOM will no longer guarantee the three games will run on Windows 10. While all three games will continue to be playable on Windows 10 systems, future system or game updates may make the games incompatible with the operating system. Additionally, support will only be provided based on information from before Windows 10 support was discontinued.</p>



<p>While this is unlikely to be an issue for Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter World, as both games have stopped receiving new patches for some time, the end of Window 10 support for Monster Hunter Wilds, which coincides with Microsoft ending support for their older operating system, could be a problem, as the game is actively getting patched with fixes and updates, and its performance is still in dire need of improvement, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">it hasn't improved a lot since launch.</a></p>



<p>Speaking about new Monster Hunter Wilds updates, the latest entry in the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236233?l=english">getting a new Title Update today</a>, which introduces collaboration content with Final Fantasy XIV, including Omega Planetes as an additional monster, the Dark Knight Hunter armor and Pictomancy spells, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, which will be the target of a new event quest, and more.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer interviewed Resident Evil Requiem producer Masata Kumazawa</a>, who opened up about CAPCOM's issues with rumors and leaks for this game. Kumazawa-san admitted that fans get frustrated with the developers because of rumors or theories that the studio never really promised, and that, in turn, is frustrating for them.</p>



<p><em>Sometimes I talk to people and they act as if various speculation and rumours are just already a confirmed thing, and then they start talking on that basis. I would like everyone to remember, let's calm down a bit - what we've shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumours and theories were such that they were widely believed.</em></p>



<p>Many of the rumors (mainly sparked by long-time CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem) are about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-remake-re-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged presence of Leon Kennedy in the game</a>, which CAPCOM has never really confirmed to this day. But there's also another hot topic: the hooded man seen in previous Resident Evil Requiem trailers, which fans are absolutely convinced is a returning character. However, Kumazawa confirmed that this was not the case.</p>



<p><em>Everyone is convinced that the hooded figure has to be a reveal of a returning cast member, and there is speculation that it ‘must be this person or must be that person’. But we don't always want to just lean on surprise comebacks like these. The hooded person is a new character, we will confirm that much. In this case, it's a newly created character for this storyline, so it's a bit of a previously undisclosed detail, but hopefully it contextualises how we’re approaching the game's story.</em></p>



<p>It won't be that long before players can verify for themselves what's true and what's not<span>&nbsp;since Resident Evil Requiem is slated to launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2 (which,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>based on off-scree</span>n footage from TGS</a>, is looking pretty good). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is confirmed to support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for optimal visuals and performance.</p>

            <p>As has been the case with all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s sizeable updates this far, Team Cherry have put out some tweaks as a Steam beta shot to the upcoming patch three's chaser. As of now, opting into playtesting this "interim update" offers some extra controller support and fixes, but the devs say more'll be added before the full patch goes live to everyone.</p>
<p>In case you need a refesher, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">first patch made a couple of its early bosses a bit easier</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksongs-latest-public-update-fixes-its-worst-boss-but-not-as-much-as-youre-likely-hoping">its second patch</a> didn't do any balancing, but did bring handy fixes to problems like the Savage Beastfly boss cheekily hiding below some lava.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to this weekend just gone, and a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/596286923597002888/">fresh Steam post</a> from devs Team Cherry. "While work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>'s third patch continues, an interim update is now live on the public-beta branch," they wrote. "This includes a few fixes that players may want to access, including some additional controller support and improvements."</p>
<p>In terms of controllers, the studio have added in support for PlayStation's dualsense edge stick-and-button doodads, generally improved how well controllers work on Mac, and made sure the game'll now automatically pause if your controller disconnects. That last one's good news if you happen, for reasons definitely not related to a boss narrowly besting you, to lob your bit of game-playing plastic across a room. Or out of a window.</p><p>Team Cherry have also enacted some "smaller" controller tweaks they don't deem worth dedicating in excess of one bullet point to, but have confirmed that more of those will be coming in the future. As for the rest of the tweaks currently in this beta update, they're as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that's it for now, Team Cherry did add that folks can "expect further additions prior to this one going live". So, if there's a fix or tweak you're desperate for and don't see here, there's still very much a chance it could make it into patch 3's public release.

<p>Until then, maybe check if there's a mod for it, nestled among the ones which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">make Hornet curvy</a> or ensure she'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-miss-how-much-hornet-used-to-scream-and-shout-theres-a-hollow-knight-silksong-mod-youll-shaw-ly-want-to-pick-up">yell things at you</a>.</p>

            <p>Over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development, according to the country's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) that runs the Tokyo Games Show.</p>
<p>The claim is based on responses from 54 Japanese game companies in a preview of the 2025 CESA Video Game Industry Report (as reported by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF251PU0V20C25A9000000/?n_cid=SNSTW005">The Nikkei</a>). The survey sample is taken from CESA's <a href="https://www.cesa.or.jp/about/member-list/index-en.html">member companies</a>, which include the likes of Capcom, Konami, FromSoftware, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Sega, as well as smaller indie studios.</p>
<p>The report preview stated 51 percent of companies are using AI, with the most common use being generating visual assets and character images, as well as story and text generation, followed by programming support. Further, 32 percent of companies are using AI to develop their own game engines.</p>
<p>The report will be released in full in early December, so specifically cited uses of AI remain under wraps.</p>
<p>However, some Japanese companies have been open about their use of AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">Automaton </a>reported in 2023 on Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> using AI tool Stable Diffusion, while earlier this year <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> was experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>Nintendo, notably absent from the CESA member list, has taken a stance against AI. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction-than-follow-ai-trend-says-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto stated the company would "rather go in a different direction"</a> as part of its pursuit of originality.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-was-everywhere-at-gamescom-2025">AI was a common theme at Gamescom</a>, seen by some indie studios as an invaluable tool.</p>

            <p>Gearbox revealed its first DLC vault hunter for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> during the Tokyo Game Show over the weekend. C4SH will be coming to the game in Q1 2026 alongside the game's first story pack.</p>
<p>C4SH was revealed via a short cinematic teaser at the Borderlands 4 Tokyo Game Show panel, and is a former casino dealer robot who'll use a degree of chance across all three of their skill trees. A full ability breakdown is set to take place in the near future, though there's no date just yet.</p>
<p>The new character will arrive alongside a story pack called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. This pack will bring new main missions to complete, new gear, a new region on the map, a load of new cosmetics, and of course C4SH to tie it all together.</p>

<p>While the future of Borderlands 4 was shown off proudly in Japan, the game is still tackling technical hurdles in the present. While a recent patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-crashing-on-pc-theres-a-new-patch-for-that">has gone a ways in tackling performance issues</a>, it has brought with it additional problems with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-patch-adds-fov-sliders-somehow-both-improves-and-worsens-stability-at-the-same-time">Gearbox telling some on PC to clear their shader cache</a> if things aren't stable within 15-minutes of play time.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-switch-2-version-has-been-delayed-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight">Borderlands 4's Switch 2 version was delayed to an unspecified date</a> for "additional development and polish time". Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford advised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">those on X unhappy with Borderlands 4 performance issues to refund the game</a> in the days following its release.</p>
<p>Still, those able to get the game running well are having a good time with the sci-fi shooter. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">Eurogamer's Borderlands 4 review states</a>: "Borderlands 4 brings a more sensible script and a true open world to its pseudo-cel-shaded gun-show. But these moderate improvements are undermined by frustrating exploration and combat that takes too long to properly shine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct, KING Art and Deep Silver debuted a gorgeous in-engine trailer for the upcoming real-time strategy game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV and shared some details about the game's inspiration. Originally announced at Gamescom 2025 and slated for a 2026 launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272360/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War_IV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>), the game will, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3u6jlJUEVI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Creative Director Jan Theysen</a>, follow in the footsteps of the first game in the franchise.</p>



<p><em>The first big decision, of course, was what we were aiming for. Do we try to do a Dawn of War 1 or 2 or a mix of both? We like both of them. But in the end, we said no, let's really go with Dawn of War 1; that's our guiding star. We talked to a lot of people: 'What do you remember from Dawn of War 1? What made it Dawn of War 1 for you?' And everybody was excited about sync kills. That was just something that everybody remembered, and so we said, okay, we definitely want sync kills in the game, but could we maybe even make it more spectacular or something that 20 years later is super cool? And so we came up with a new system.</em></p>



<p><em>I think when you do a new version or reinterpretation of a classic game, the challenge is always that you're not trying to recreate the old game, but you try to recreate the feeling that people had when they played the old game, right? What you basically want to do is you look at the old game, you ask yourself, okay, how did this work and how did this make us feel and how can we do this 20 years later?</em></p>



<p>Jan Theysen then discussed the developers' choices when it comes to the factions that will be featured in Dawn of War IV:</p>



<p><em>There are so many cool factions and so many cool stories you could choose from. We ended up picking the factions we picked because we felt if we do like a new version or an evolution of Dawn of War, you need the Blood Ravens and you need the Orks. That is just a given.</em></p>



<p><em>We thought about adding the Nekrons to Dawn of War IV because we felt that, you know, Nekrons were kind of promised for Dawn of War 3 and never came. So, it felt like a nice touch to finally give them to the players. There may be a faction that never had a big role in the Dawn of War games and there are not that many. The Adeptus Mechanicus is definitely a big and important faction in the 40K universe and they were never part of the Dawn of War franchise, so we felt that's a good opportunity to have something new for everyone.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As a reminder, the first three games were made by Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went independent from SEGA in March 2024</a> and is now working on a self-published turn-based strategy game called Earth vs Mars, <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-announces-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as announced in February 2025</a>.</p>



<p>As for KING Art, the German studio's last game was the real-time strategy game Iron Harvest, which launched in 2020. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it an 8 out of 10 score</a> back then.</p>

Not only does it benefit from an even bigger jump in visual quality, but it also expands on the overall story with new cutscenes, dialogue, and side-stories. Kiryu will also be able to use a new weapon-based combat style based on Okinawan martial arts, and fans can even take part in a life-simulator minigame at his orphanage, Morning Glory, through various outdoor activities.</p><p>Other additions include a new team battle mode where Kiryu's motorcycle gang takes on rival outfits, and most importantly, there'll be new Karaoke songs to sing along to. But perhaps the biggest draw here is Dark ties, an all-new prequel to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that reveals more details about Yoshitaka Mine, one of Kiryu's greatest foes and the primary antagonist of this remake. RGG says this is a gritty crime story set in Kamurocho, where Mine rises to power. The prequel also adds a new mission-based mode called Kanda Damage Control and a survival mode set in an underground fight club.</p></div>                      </div><div title="Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 preorder for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4458" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 preorder for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 for PS5 / Xbox Series X</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases December 8</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you're looking to catch up on mainline Yakuza entries, you're in luck as both Yakuza Kiwami 1 and 2 are being bundled together into a single physical edition for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Kiwami-1-2-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FSG45S74?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Kiwami-1-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0FSGMPG6G?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> for $60.

One of the big changes here was that the combat system was overhauled entirely to be closer to Yakuza 0, giving Kiryu four unique fighting styles to choose from--Brawler, Beast, Rush, and Dragon--during his adventure. While Yakuza 0 featured a powerful antagonist in the form of Mr. Shakedown--an absolute brute who could be randomly encountered in the game world and would rob you blind if he beat you in a fight--Yakuza Kiwami featured the "Majima Everywhere" challenge instead.</p><p>This saw Kiryu's rival, Goro Majima, randomly pop up during gameplay to challenge him to a street fight or minigames like darts and bowling. Defeating him would unlock new abilities in Kiryu's Dragon style.</p><p>On a technical level, the resolution, framerate, textures, and loading times were greatly improved when compared to the original game, more substories were added, and the remake had a Japanese dub that was far superior to the English audio track. Another noteworthy improvement was to the overall story, as additional cutscenes fleshed out Yakuza's antagonist, Nishiki, went on, providing crucial insight to his betrayal of Kiryu. The cherry on top was an expansion of Heat Actions that Kiryu could perform, giving him even more over-the-top finishers to use during combat.</p><p>Released in 2017, Yakuza Kiwami 2 saw ex-Yakuza Kiryu embroiled in a massive gang war in the Japanese underworld, following the assassination of the Tojo clan's Fifth Chairman, Yukio Terada, by the rival Omi Alliance. At the center of this conflict was Ryuji Goda, the Dragon of Kansai who was hellbent on defeating Kiryu and cementing his legend as the <em>only </em>dragon of the Yakuza. The remake also added a new scenario centered around Goro Majima, revealing just what the loose cannon gangster had been up to since he left the Tojo clan to form his own construction company.</p><p>For this sequel, gameplay was also revamped significantly to be more in line with Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, and the visual upgrade also made a big difference to the bone-crunching action.</p></div>                      </div><div title="6534988 -- Yakuza 0: Director's Cut for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4459" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534988 -- Yakuza 0: Director's Cut for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases December 8</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Chronologically, Yakuza 0 is the first game in the franchise and it stars both Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima.

The PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC versions will be priced at $50, the same MSRP as the Switch 2 edition. That said, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F65ZBSXY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 version is on sale for $37 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>Th Director's Cut adds several new scenes, a brand-new English voiceover, and Red Light Raid mode, a series of co-op battles where players unite to make some fast cash with their fists.</p><p>While the main campaign is thrilling, the management sim side stories where Majima gets roped into hosting a hostess club and Kiryu joins the dangerous world of real estate are also unmissable in this 3D beat-'em-up masterpiece.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSG6FKTM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSGQXX58?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F65ZBSXY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2</a> -- $37 (<del>$50</del>) | <em>Available now<br></em></li></ul></div>                      </div><h2>More Yakuza games</h2><p>Beyond the upcoming preorders, you can dive into several more Yakuza adventures as well. Each game is designed to have an episodic feel to its story, and the series has evolved over the years with new protagonists and spin-offs. In case you already have one of the two current Kiwami games in your collection, you can pick them up individually, and if you feel like taking a step back in time, you can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Remastered-Collection-Standard-playstation-4/dp/B0842KKL9N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Yakuza Remastered Collection</a>. This collects Yakuza 3,4, and 5 in one bundle and it offers substantially improved performance.</p><p>Granted, these are the original games given an HD makeover, and the gameplay largely remains the same, which might result in some of these titles feeling dated. What this collection also adds is a completely redone English localization, visual and audio changes to several characters, content that was originally cut from the Western releases have been added back in, and certain problematic content has also been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574545" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574545"></a><figcaption>Yakuza 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg"></figure><p>The other big recommendation here is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Judgment-PS5-playstation-5/dp/B08WDLP8L9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Judgment</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Judgment-PlayStation-5/dp/B094F4RX8H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lost Judgment</a>. While these games are mechanically similar to the Yakuza titles and also feature an episodic storyline structure, they focus on a new character and add investigative elements to the franchise formula. The Judgment games also deal with heavier subject matter, focusing even more on institutionalized corruption, Japan's controversial legal system, medical malpractice, murder, and high school suicides, while weaving together a tight narrative.</p><p>In the modern era, the Yakuza games have evolved into the Like a Dragon series. These games follow a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, on his adventures and so far two titles have been released--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-Steelbook-playstation-4/dp/B0889CMW4S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. In the gameplay department, they're a massive departure from the beat-'em-up games starring Kiryu as they use turn-based RPG elements instead. The first spin-off of this series, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Pirate-Yakuza-Standard-PlayStation/dp/B0DHLPSVJT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener
