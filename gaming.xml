			<p>The expansion Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was unveiled today during the September 2024 State of Play. Fans got a first look at the upcoming expansion in a trailer released by Remedy. Fans already expected this expansion to be released sometime in October, and this was confirmed once again, albeit with no specific date. Furthermore, a more detailed synopsis for fans to dive into. While the trailer didn't expose too many details, it became obvious that the story centered around the Federal Bureau of Control, with the station being set inside the Lake House.</p>
<p>Instead of playing as Alan Wake, this time, you'll be playing as Kiran Estevez, an FBC agent, as the story takes place parallel to the main game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 – The Lake House Expansion Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHfs75K-y4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House is clearly linked to Remedy's other major franchise, Control, as part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a> (which will now be expanded into film and television following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna Pictures</a>).</p>
<p>The previous Alan Wake 2 DLC, Night Springs, featured three episodes with three different protagonists, one of whom was Control's main character, Jesse Faden. Reviewer Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 8.5 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</em></p>

        <p>Aihama, Japan. The final years of the Edo period. One rain-drenched evening, a group of men burst into the town’s brother and sister-run umbrella shop. Yushin is cut down in front of his sister Yui, leaving her alone in the world. The next thing he knows, he is looking down at his own stricken corpse—a soul without a body. The grim incident shatters the peace in this quiet backwater. Lurking beneath the surface is an intricate, deep-rooted plot, shrouded in mystery. Until Yui is safe, not even death is enough to extinguish Yushin’s soul. He’ll stop at nothing on his quest, shifting from body to body, possessing anyone and anything to rescue his sister.

Magic Circles are the Key to Character Development</strong></p><p>Magic Circles are a unique party formation system from the <em>Cladun</em> series, enabling a party of multiple characters to function in an action RPG where the player only controls one character.</p><p>The player-controlled character—the “main character”—is positioned at the center, while the “sub characters” placed around them provide support and boost their power.</p><p><em>—Placing special items in the Magic Circle activates the sub characters, allowing you to enhance the main character as much as you like.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_020.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are over 200 types of Magic Circles, with some being four times larger than those in previous entries. Certain Magic Circles can support a party of up to 16 characters. New effect spaces have also been added, expanding the variety of power-up combinations.</p><p>In battle, sub characters in the Magic Circle act as shields, absorbing damage in place of the main character. As long as the sub characters stay alive, the main character won’t take any damage.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_021.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_022.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_023.jpg"></a></figure><p>New Magic Circles are learned each time you level up, and the Magic Circles learned differ based on your class. For example, a wizard will learn Magic Circles that specialize in using magic, while a Merchant will learn Magic Circles that allows them to use money.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_024.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>● Formidable Foes and <a title="Companies > Treasure [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/treasure">Treasure</a>s Await in the Ever-Changing Random Dungeons (Ran-geons)</strong></p><p>The Ran-geon is a 100-level random dungeon separate from the main story dungeons.</p><p>Each time you enter the Ran-geon, its layout changes. You’ll need to find either the “gate” to the next level or the “exit” to escape.</p><p>Every time you pass through one of the five randomly appearing gates, the monster levels increase, and elements like item drop rates are randomly changed.</p><p>If luck is on your side, you will enter a fever state, where items drop with every defeated enemy. But if you are unlucky, monster levels could exceed 1,000, turning your search for the exit into a nightmare…</p><p>Try out Ran-geons when you get stuck in the main story and need to level up, or want to dig up rare items to become stronger, or when you want to take on a challenge where life and death is on the line.</p><p><em>—Depending on the gate you enter, all of the enemies may become suddenly stronger, or your HP and SP may fully recover, making this dungeon a fun gamble. If you are not careful, you could be wiped out entirely!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_025.jpg"></a></figure><p>Additionally, <em>Cladun X3</em> offers a new type of Ran-geon called “Map-geons,” which can be generated using the “Magic Map.” Magic Maps can be obtained randomly by clearing the lowest level of a Map-geon, and can be shared with other players through the network.</p><p><strong>● Challenge Dungeons with Your Own Customized Character</strong></p><p>In <em>Cladun X3</em>, the main character that the player controls, as well as the sub characters that form your party, and the graphics for the characters’ weapons and armor can all be customized by the player, allowing you to challenge dungeons with characters all your own.</p><p><em>—Players can fully customize their characters’ appearance using pixel art.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_026.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Use the “draw” tool to create original weapons and armor.

Since pink noise is also supported, you can also create rhythm instruments and sound effects. Tone definition, envelope definition, and macros are also supported, allowing you to create an even wider range of music.</p><p><em>—The possibilities are endless, like creating a theme song for your customized character.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_032.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>● Share Your Custom Characters and Maps With Other Players&lt;?strong&gt;</strong></p><p>With the new “network” function, you can create a town map that matches your custom characters and share it with other players. Not only can you create your own town graphics on the town map, you can play your own background music, place characters, and create the world to your heart’s content. After you have created your city map, be sure to share it with other players!</p><p>By creating and sharing a town map, other players can explore it and receive the Magic Map you have placed. By exchanging Magic Maps with everyone, you may be able to encounter a rare dungeon that you would never see by playing the game alone.</p><p><em>—Even players who choose not to create maps can enjoy exploring maps created by other players and collecting Magic Maps in “Auto Mode.”</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_033.jpg"></a></figure><p>In the Switch version, touch controls are supported for some features like the draw tool and map editing, allowing players to enjoy drawing even without the use of a controller.</p><p><strong>■ Box Art</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_034.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_035.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_036.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Playable at Tokyo Game Show 2024</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cladun-X3_2024_09-24-24_037.jpg"></a></figure><p>A demo of <em>Cladun X3</em> will be playable at Tokyo Game Show 2024 from September 26 to 29 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan.

Most notably, Fortnite is getting its own limited-edition DualSense on November 7. It has a blue color scheme and graffiti-style decals inspired by the game. PlayStation also unveiled its new Chroma Collection, which gives three DualSense colors and matching console covers a flashy chrome finish.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fortnite controller certainly stands out with a chaotic design that's the complete opposite of the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-preorder/1100-6525376/" data-ref-id="1100-6525376">Astro Bot controller</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DC7WHMZ2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold out</a>). Nevertheless, it's a limited-edition DualSense controller themed around Fortnite, so it will likely sell out fast when preorders go live October 3. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372401" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372401"></a><figcaption>Fortnite DualSense</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372401-fortniteds.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the Fortnite theming, the controller is otherwise the same as other standard DualSense controllers, complete with features like haptic feedback, dynamic triggers, touchpad, and gyro controls. PlayStation recently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJSY6961?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">raised the price of DualSense controllers by five bucks</a>, and the Fortnite controller reflects this change with an $85 list price. The Astro Bot controller only costs $80 (if you can find it), probably because preorders were already available when the increase went into effect. Going forward, limited-edition DualSense controllers will likely cost $85.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">More Fortnite controllers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372403" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372403"></a><figcaption>PowerA's official Fortnite edition controllers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4372403-fortpads.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Cloud-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D8T84XZ7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA OPS V1 Wireless Controller - Fortnite Edition (PC, Mobile)</a> -- $55</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5K4WGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller - Peely Edition (Switch)</a>-- $65</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Xbox-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D8T8QQ9S?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA Wireless Xbox Controller - Fortnite Special Edition (Xbox, PC, Mobile)</a>-- $100 | Releases October 1</li></ul><p>If you're interested in the Fortnite DualSense controller but aren't able to get one when preorders go live, there are new and upcoming third-party wireless gamepads with official Fortnite themes for Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

It'll arrive sometime in 2025.</p><p>It was the big announcement to close out the State of Play, and one of the biggest surprises. Developer Sucker Punch showed off a significant look at footage too, including some gorgeous cinematics. And if you couldn't glean from the title, it'll focus on a different setting and a brand-new protagonist, Atsu, moving away from Ghost of Tsushima's Jin Sakai. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Sucker Puncher didn't reveal too much during the presentation, but we got a little more insight thanks to a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> shortly after. It'll take place in 1603, 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, known as Hokkaido today. Sucker Punch calls it "a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima, and it’s the setting for an original story we can’t wait to tell."</p><p>According to the post, the developer "wanted to maintain the core pillars established in Ghost of Tsushima: playing as a wandering warrior in Feudal Japan, offering freedom to explore at your own pace, and highlighting the beauty of the world."</p><p>"We also wanted to continue to innovate. To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," the post continues. "At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-3-blogroll-1727219402294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei, will arrive in 2025. </figcaption></figure></output><p>As "Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5," it'll also include new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and new weapons. </p><p>Unabashedly inspired by the works of Akira Kurosawa (to the point where the game even included a "Kurosawa Mode") and other samurai films, Ghost of Tsushima followed a samurai on a quest to protect Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. It released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2020 followed by a multiplayer mode, Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, that October.

But the big news was the reveal of the game's launch date: the Monster Hunter Wilds release date is February 28, 2025, and it'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>We recently played a preview build of the game, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">came away impressed with Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, but you can watch the new trailer below. And further <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-launches-february-28-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details on Monster Hunter Wilds</a> were given on PlayStation blog. Arkveld is the flagship monster for this entry and comes from a long-extinct species, and the mystery of its existence is at the heart of the story. In the Forbidden Lands, where Wilds takes place, a research team investigates attacks by a monster they call the "White Wraith" and follow clues from a boy they saved named Nata. Arkveld is a beastly figure with massive chain-like wings it uses to attack.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>From here, you form units within the Hunter's Guild. You as the protagonist belong to the Avis Unit and the characters featured in the trailer - Olivia the hunter, Erik the biologist, and Werner the engineer - belong to the Astrum Unit. And it seems that this is the lens for which you experience Monster Hunters Wilds' story.</p><p>The Scarlet Forest was shown in previous trailers but this latest one gave a closer look at its lucious environments where you'll be fishing, scaling cliffs, and hunting monsters, of course. Using a hookshot-like Slinger can lead to contextual environmental destruction which can be a key part of battles. The Slinger can also whip you around the world as a means of traversal, along with a pet Seikret mount.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>In case you missed it, be sure to read up on the newly announced remaster of the PS1 classics, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-playstation-store-ahead-of-state-of-play-broadcast">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2</a>, and the reveal of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">Ghost of Tsushima sequel, titled Ghost of Yotei</a>.

While fans had speculated for months that the company would take Pocketpair to court, speculation largely revolved around the similarities of some of Palworld's monster designs to Pokemon's. The actual lawsuit, however, revolves around patented game mechanics, leaving many puzzled as to how it may actually play out in Japanese courts.</p><p>Palworld launched in early access in January this year on PC and Xbox as a day-one Game Pass title. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-review">gave its early access launch an 8/10</a>, saying that it "may crib quite a bit from Pokémon’s homework, but deep survival mechanics and a hilarious attitude make it hard to put down – even in Early Access."</p><p>You can catch up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-announcements">everything announced in today's State of Play right here</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>If you've been sleeping on the Akira Kurosawa-inspired, <em>Assassin's Creed</em>-esque samurai game <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you've been missing out. Given that it recently got a PC release, this is a great time to catch up on it—but now there's even more reason to do so, as Sony just announced a sequel titled <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>.</p>
<p>Slated for a 2025 release, the game bears similarities to its predecessor. It follows a wandering samurai who rides horses across picturesque, wind-swept fields, befriends animals, and defeats enemies in katana duels.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>was set on Tsushima Island during the time of the Mongol invasion, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is (fittingly) set around the foot of Mount Yōtei, one of Japan's most picturesque locales—the area is called Hokkaido today.</p>
<p>Most fans of the first game expected a new location in <em>Tsushima</em>'s sequel, but they may not have expected the other big change: there appears to be a new protagonist. The woman who appears in the trailers is not Jin Sakai, the main character of <em>Tsushima</em>. This suggests the franchise will move forward with something like an anthology format instead of direct sequels. A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">blog post from Sony</a> says the new character is named Atsu.</p>
<p>The blog post also says that <em>Yōtei</em> takes place in 1603, 300 years after the events of <em>Tsushima</em>.</p>
<p>Developer Sucker Punch hasn't revealed anything about the gameplay, though, beyond what we see in the trailer. So far, what we see looks almost identical to what we've played before. There are surely going to be more announcements to come, though.</p>

But as revealed during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, Reeves will also be voicing Shadow earlier in December as part of a DLC release for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-coming-october-25-new-trailer-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/1100-6524053/" data-ref-id="1100-6524053">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p><p>Only a brief clip of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC was shown during State of Play, but it dropped Reeves' Shadow directly into Tokyo, which is one of the settings in the film.</p><p>While speaking to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/movie-shadow-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Shun Nakamura noted that the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie pack is unconnected to the narrative of Shadow Generations. Instead, he described it as "bonus content," but stressed that Shadow's controls will remain consistent with the main game.</p><p>"The development team also lives in Tokyo, so we tried to develop this setting an enjoyable place as a Sonic game but also clearly showing the Tokyo-likeness," added Nakamura. "We even went out for research to the actual area being used in the game for inspiration. We feel it is very exciting to play as Shadow in a real existing city, so please look forward to it."</p><p>Sonic x Shadow Generations is coming to all consoles and PC on October 25, while the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack will be released on December 12. The DLC will also be available as part of the Sonic x Shadow Generations Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

			<p>It's no surprise whatsoever that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was going to be announced, and as expected, it was announced today during the State of Play. The remaster will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC, with the game launching on 31 October 2024. Those who already own the original PlayStation 4 title will be able to get an upgrade for $9.99.</p>
<p>At the moment, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered isn't listed on the Steam store, despite the release date of the game being so close.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMN-x9goE7M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Compared to The Last of Us remasters, there seems to be more substance to this update. While the main focus is that the graphics have been updated to match Forbidden West, over ten hours of dialogue has been re-recorded. In addition, facial animations have been improved to provide an extra element of realism.</p>
<p>It's not surprising at all that this game was getting a remaster, as just last week, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/">rated by the ESRB</a>, giving away the fact that the game's remaster was going to be released on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Horizon's franchise continues to grow, as Horizon is also getting a LEGO game in the near future, where players will get to explore the expansive world, which has been faithfully recreated using LEGO. Much like the remaster, this game will also be available on PC, as well as on Nintendo Switch. Although it hasn't got a release date yet, the game is officially open for pre-order. It's reported that LEGO Horizon Adventures will be released on November 14, but Guerilla Games hasn't yet confirmed the date.</p>
<p>Compared to previous remasters developed for PlayStation, Horizon comes as a general shock to the audience, as it was only released in 2017 and looked pretty good, all things considered. Whether this now means that Horizon Forbidden West will equally get a remaster coming up soon remains to be seen, but it wouldn't be that surprising. The Last of Us received two remasters, with The Last of Us Part 2 also getting its own remaster, despite only being released in 2020. Although technology advances constantly, technology for creating a game like The Last of Us 2 hasn't evolved that much, and it seemed very unnecessary to make a remaster of a game that was still looking brand-new and up to date compared to other IPs that PlayStation fans have been asking for for years now. These IPs include Bloodborne for PC, Demon's Souls for PC, and remakes of games such as Parasite Eve and Dino Crisis (which was added to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/ps-plus/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Plus catalog </a>for October.)</p>

And boy howdy, it sure does look pretty. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-atsu-woman-trailer-release-date-1851656719&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-atsu-woman-trailer-release-date-1851656719"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a></span> is the name of the newly revealed sequel and it’s set in a different part of Japan, a few hundred years after the events of the first game, and stars a new character, Atsu. We don’t know much more about the story, but Sucker Punch did make it clear in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post published after the reveal</a></span> that it “wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend.” The setting, according to the blog post, is the year 1603, in “the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei” in the region of Japan that today is known as Hokkaido.&nbsp;That’s all we really know about the story and world of this sequel. </p><p>Looking at the new 4K trailer posted by Sony, it really feels like <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> was designed not only to showcase the power of the PS5, but also to show off the newly announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442">$700 PS5 Pro.</a></span> It’s shocking to me that Sony didn’t include this game in the PS5 Pro announcement, even as a tiny teaser, to show off something totally new and amazing looking, running on the pricey console. </p><p>According to Sucker Punch, this is the first game they’ve built from “the ground up” for PS5. And I expect<em>  Ghost of Yōtei</em> will take full advantage of the PS5 Pro. Here’s what Sucker Punch had to say about working on the PS5. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This is also Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, and we’re excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real. We have massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, whole new skies featuring twinkling stars and auroras, even more believable movement from wind on grass and vegetation, and more improvements we’ll share in the future. Our new setting also gives us the opportunity to introduce new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons.</p></blockquote><p>And now, let’s look at some pretty screenshots of this gorgeous-looking game, which is set to launch sometime in 2025. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f6313e38fc8232b10c917f39cf4e9d50"

And if having an iridescent console isn’t eye-catching enough, you can also get new DualSense controllers to match.</p><p>The Chroma console covers will cost $64.99 USD, while the DualSense controllers will cost $79.99. Sony is launching the Chroma pearl and indigo accessories on November 7th, followed by teal on January 23, 2025. The new colors look neat, but they’re quite intense — I’m not sure I’d want to swap out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031802/sony-ps5-slim-new-colors-hands-on-photos">sleek blue, red, or gray of the PS5 Slim</a> for these.</p><p>You’ll be able to preorder covers and controllers from the collection on October 3rd, with availability in the US, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Sony is also opening preorders for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">30th Anniversary PS5 and PS5 Pro on September 26th</a>, which deck them out in the colors of the original 1995 PlayStation — but we don’t yet know if Sony will sell those throwback grey covers separately. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players who pre-order will get access to the “Guild Knight Set” and the Talisman “Hope Charm.” Capcom also says that anyone who pre-orders the downloadable version from the PlayStation Store will receive a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> digital art book. This is apparently a PlayStation store exclusive and will function as a separate app on your PS5. Sounds a bit clunky, but hey, art is nice to look at. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>arrives February 28, 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Series S. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
