            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-zero-extraction-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Doghowl Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>release date, and the alien-blasting extraction shooter is launching later this summer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/6339459950921613987" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Early Access on August 6th, and if Doghowl and tinyBuild are to be believed, a great many potential players will be happy to see it arrive.</p>
<p>In that same Steam post, the two studios share some stats regarding the game's recent open beta, which ran from June 9th to June 17th and coincided with Steam Next Fest, and it turns out that thousands of players checked this one out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rf3UksPp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rdm4BfZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>brings more extraction shooter shenanigans (what else?) to Steam in August.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Doghowl and tinyBuild's stats,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>was one of the Next Fest's most-played demos, alongside titles like&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em>.</p>
<p>The studios also say the game attracted almost 5,000 concurrent players during the open beta period, making it the second most popular demo on offer.</p>
<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>attracted more than 300,000 players during the demo window, and it now has over 350,000 wishlists according to Doghowl and tinyBuild, so people are certainly interested in this project at the very least.</p>
<p>Around 2.36 million matches were played during the open beta, and the game's most popular firearm by far was the Nailgun, which racked up almost 400,000 kills, almost ten times as many as the next most popular option (the G-17).</p>

<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, an extraction shooter with an emphasis on horror. It's explicitly being pitched by the devs as a game for those who enjoy the likes of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">perhaps not so much anymore</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million"><i>Content Warning</i></a>.</p>
<p>The game's asymmetric multiplayer pits "elite PMC mercenar[ies]" against alien horrors controlled by players, with teams of mercenaries facing off against aliens, each other, and the environment while gathering valuable loot.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 6th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-generate-textures-objects/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-future-versions-may-use-ai-to-generate-textures-objects-and-characters.907905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-generate-textures-objects/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Future versions of NVIDIA DLSS could use AI to generate textures and objects, among other things, potentially introducing another big game changer that could greatly impact the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/q-and-a-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Than Moore</a>, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang provided some hints regarding what future versions of NVIDIA DLSS may feature. As of now, AI is being used for neural graphics, generating pixels based off a few input pixels (Super Resolution) and to generate frames (Frame Generation), but in the future, it will be possible to even generate textures and objects and the objects can even be of lower quality and can be made to look better with AI. Additionally, it will be possible to even generate characters in games, having, for example, among a group of six characters, two real ones, and others may be long-term use AIs. Ultimately, AI will become more dominant in the future, and NVIDIA cannot wait to let more people have it.</p>
<p><em>The games will be made with AI, they’ll have AI inside, and you’ll even have the PC become AI using G-Assist. You can use the PC as an AI assistant to help you game. &nbsp;GeForce is the biggest gaming brand in the world, we only see it growing, and a lot of them have AI in some capacity. We can’t wait to let more people have it.</em></p>

<p>While the NVIDIA CEO did not specify if any of these features will be among those offered by NVIDIA DLSS 4, it will be very interesting to see what the new version of the technology will offer in addition to the aforementioned Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction introduced in major previous versions. With a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-cut-down-gb202-gpu-448-bit-bus-28-gb-gddr7-memory/">GPU generation</a> launching later this year, it may not take much longer to learn what is next for NVIDIA's technology and how AI will continue influencing and possibly shaping gaming in the future.</p>

<p id="Ij99Vl">In addition to its broad spectrum of compatibility, the 8Bitdo Pro 2 is now one of the few Bluetooth controllers equipped with Hall Effect switches, which help to reduce or eliminate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23627127/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-gulikit-stick-hall-effect-fix-installation-buy">stick drift</a> (an issue that has plagued the Nintendo Switch since its launch).</p>
<p id="4VM1W8">For those of us old enough to remember, the layout of the 8Bitdo Pro 2 most closely resembles a classic SNES controller, albeit with a pair of analog sticks and some large grips built onto the side for improved ergonomics. The Pro 2 features the same number of inputs as contemporary controllers, which can all be remapped to different profiles via the 8Bitdo Ultimate app on your PC or mobile device.</p>

  <p id="f5B2Zo">It’s not easy to adapt a fictional property — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Online">The Lord of the Rings</a>, say, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe_Online">DC Universe</a> —into a massively multiplayer online game, or any kind of living game. Many have failed. The demands of a set canon are seldom compatible with an evolving online world, or a universe in which thousands of players are living their own hero’s journeys.</p>
<p id="deXATv">Funcom knows this: The Norwegian developer has been making MMOs since 2001’s <em>Anarchy Online</em>, including a licensed effort, <em>Age of Conan</em>. So, for survival MMO <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090204/dune-awakening-survival-game-2024"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, Funcom, Frank Herbert’s estate, and Legendary (producers of the Dune movies) decided to do something very smart: change the Dune timeline and establish its own alternate history of Arrakis.</p>
<p id="VnHj0I">As teased in the game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167968/dune-awakening-story-trailer-summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest trailer</a> and detailed in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBRo-cotgkQ">half-hour deep dive video</a>, in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s setting, Paul Atreides was never born. His mother, Lady Jessica, chose to have a daughter instead of a son, tying her more closely to the Bene Gesserit; Jessica is trained as a truthsayer and foretells Doctor Yueh’s betrayal, so her husband, Duke Leto, survives and House Atreides isn’t wiped out in the attack on Arrakeen.</p>
<p id="2bRniw">With Paul out of the picture, there’s a power vacuum, and more narrative room for players to feel like the heroes of their own stories. And House Atreides and House Harkonnen are evenly matched in a war for the future of Arrakis — a convenient setup for the factional gameplay that MMOs thrive on. But the essential political motivations of all the characters and players remain the same as in Frank Herbert’s original vision.</p>
<p id="Wjb9hr">The Fremen are the final piece of this puzzle, and Funcom has chosen to put them at the center of a narrative mystery. The desert inhabitants of Arrakis have disappeared — supposedly wiped out, according to Imperium propaganda. What happened to them? Where did they go? Players are sent in search of the missing people, exploring their abandoned dwellings, rites, culture, and spirituality as they go. (I’d say the chances of the Fremen being added as a playable faction later on, perhaps in an expansion, seem pretty high.)</p>
<p id="MHUjZm">In terms of gameplay, the video is a little lighter on detail, but there are some interesting tidbits. A look at the character creator reveals that a choice of mentor determines your character’s starting ability: Choose a Mentat mentor and you’ll be able to scan enemies and objects for information; a Bene Gesserit mentor will teach you to use the Voice to compel characters to approach you (effectively a taunt); a Swordmaster background grants you a defensive stance. But you’ll be able to combine abilities from the different schools later in the game.</p>
<p id="MHDYo0">In a section of the video focused on the game’s closed beta and its online structure, creative director Joel Bylos said that <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s endgame lies in an area called the Deep Desert. There, hundreds of concurrent players will engage in player-versus-player combat, harvest spice in big groups, and engage with an endgame political system.</p>
<p id="Lpygrz">Bylos also explained what makes the game an MMO. As opposed to a single-server, single-map game like <em>Ark: Survival Evolved, Dune: Awakening</em> will group multiple maps and servers together into “worlds” of thousands of players who can organize themselves into guilds. The starting area, Hagga Basin, supports a minimum of 40 players per server, but beyond that there are social hubs and the Deep Desert, where Bylos promised “many, many hundreds” of players will be able to play together. The Overland map is its own live server that links these locations, with players using Ornithopters and other transportation to move around it in real time.</p>
<p id="p2iIPD"><em>Dune: Awakening </em>has no announced release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Funcom says it will show live gameplay at Gamescom, which runs from Aug. 21-25. </p>

  <p id="vNmqYa">Science fiction, to echo Ursula K. Le Guin, is not predictive, but descriptive. While most science fiction films attempt (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22435082/zpg-1972-sci-fi-predictions-future-that-were-wrong">fail</a>) to extrapolate the ideas and concerns of their respective present to predict what the world may look like in the not-so-distant future, these extrapolations ultimately amount to stories that exist in conversation with the hopes and fears of the times in which they were conceived.</p>
<p id="R28g4x">All of this is to say that science fiction (i.e., speculative fiction) is a genre of possibilities and introspection, one whose long legacy through the medium of cinema has produced countless iconic works whose thematic depth and aesthetic resonance have enlivened and inspired the imaginations of countless more generations. From Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis</em> and Andrei Tarkovsky’s <em>Solaris</em> to Andrew Niccol’s <em>Gattaca</em> and more, the history and legacy of science fiction in film is one of futures past that have since gone on to shape and inform our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21515948/what-science-fiction-means-today">view of the present</a>, all while entertaining and edifying audiences new and old alike.</p>
<p id="R4Srtd">We’ve created a list of some of our favorite sci-fi films currently available on streaming, movies that continue to inspire us look to the future and imagine worlds and ideas both fantastical yet nonetheless inextricably rooted in our reality.

<p id="3AGpLj"><strong>Director: </strong>Denis Villeneuve<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/e7dc7b3a-a494-4ef1-8107-f4308aa6bbf7">Max</a></p>
<p id="uG7iaM">In 2021, Denis Villeneuve managed to achieve something <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22738264/dune-david-lynch-explained-galaxy-brains-podcast">not even the great David Lynch could</a>: successfully taking Frank Herbert’s notoriously idiosyncratic sci-fi epic <em>Dune</em> and transform it into a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Over the course of two films (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23712612/dune-how-many-parts-movies-sequels-messiah">so far</a>), Villeneuve takes the feudal politics, surreal world-building, and cerebral exploration of religion inherent to Herbert’s book and renders them in a way that feels not only legible, but electrifying.</p>
<p id="5kEqGt">The two-part epic follows the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the heir to a powerful noble family in the far future, who is taken in by the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis after his family’s longtime adversaries succeed in killing his father and defeating his armies. Eager for revenge, and blessed with supernatural cognitive abilities and intuition, Paul must win the loyalty of the Fremen in his bid to avenge his father, all the while knowing that such a path will set in motion a galaxy-spanning war of unimaginable bloodshed and horror.</p>
<p id="punm56"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/21358695/what-is-dune-about-plot-explained"><em>Dune</em> is many things</a>: a tragic love story, a treatise on the perils of putting faith in charismatic leaders, a biting critique of vampiristic imperialism and the subjugation of native populations. That <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet"><em>Dune: Part One</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a><em> </em>manage to be all these things, while also remaining a deeply entertaining story on their own, is a testament not only to the strength of the source material but to the clarity of Villeneuve and company’s vision in bringing it to life on screen. Here’s hoping that he can pull off a hat trick with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085138/dune-2-messiah-sequel-underrated-classic-good-book"><em>Dune: Messiah</em></a>, the forthcoming third and final installment in the director’s trilogy. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="xhqvdU">Sometimes animation starts to look quaint or dated as styles and technologies change, but Katsuhiro Otomo’s landmark anime movie <em>Akira</em> still looks as startling on the screen today as it did back in 1988. Its ultimate intent, drawn from Otomo’s much longer and more in-depth manga series, can be hard to follow, depending on which translation you get — its point about human evolution is slightly fuzzy, and its impulsive, dim juvenile-delinquent protagonist isn’t up to seeing any of the scope or depth in what’s going on, let alone explaining it to the audience.</p>
<p id="fuB9tk">But the action is impeccably executed, and the emotions behind it are acute and powerful. When a bike gang in the far-future, post-apocalyptic setting of, er, 2019 Neo-Tokyo encounters a mysterious child with strange powers, one gang member gets abducted by the government, and another tries to hunt him down. Their history together and their shifting personal dynamic helps inform a sometimes gritty, sometimes hallucinogenic story about secret experiments in human potential, carried out as political unrest tears the city apart. The visuals are incredibly rich and vivid, and the tension runs high throughout the film, at all levels of its stratified society. <em>Akira</em> has been imitated for decades because there just wasn’t anything else like it in 1988. For the most part, there still isn’t. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

I’m not talking about <em>Blade Runner</em> (at least, not today), but rather the sci-fi horror classic that went on to spawn a legacy of sequels, prequels, and imitators much like a horde of hapless face-hugger-gripped humans incubating a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23593379/best-sci-fi-alien-xenomorph-ridley-scott">brood of acid-spewing nightmares</a>.</p>
<p id="TGCHHn">I don’t need to tell you what happens in <em>Alien</em>. After all, if you’re either a regular Polygon reader or someone even faintly familiar with science fiction horror, you know what the gist is. It’s the film that catapulted Sigourney Weaver to stardom, the movie that nearly every sci-fi horror game set in outer space lives in the shadow of, and an unambiguous masterpiece of world-building and creature design that is arguably yet to be eclipsed.</p>
<p id="5fdzIJ">If you somehow have never seen <em>Alien</em> before, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once. And if you have seen it before, I have some good news for you: It’s just as good as your remember it was. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="SImeFl">Gareth Edwards’ long-awaited follow-up to <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> was one of the most anticipated genre films of 2023. The logline of the story’s premise alone was enough to pique interest: An original sci-fi action adventure <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23892318/the-creator-movie-netflix-inspirations-movies-like-it">inspired by films like <em>Apocalypse Now</em> and <em>Baraka</em></a> about a special forces agent fighting in a war against artificially intelligent robots. </p>
<p id="HPOlKL">While the film didn’t quite manage to amass the audience 20th Century Studios would’ve like back when it released last September, I strongly believe the legacy of <em>The Creator</em> will endure in the years to come on the quality of its strongest aspect: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23892583/the-creator-production-designer-interview-nomad-pink-floyd">The art direction and worldbuilding</a> of its universe.</p>
<p id="PdYPLN">The futuristic world of <em>The Creator</em>’s vision of 2065 calls to mind the scrupulous iconic design of <em>Blade Runner</em>’s dystopian Los Angeles. It’s a world that feels fully lived-in, with human beings existing alongside a race of insectile-like androids; a world where towering angular megastructures loom opposite rolling hills of unspoiled pastoral landscape. </p>
<p id="scz5jK">There’s a lot of cool, speculative tech on display, from portable brain scanners that can neurologically revive people on the verge of death in android host bodies to floating fortresses that rain death from above via gigantic holographic crosshairs. Say what you might about the plot, but <em>The Creator</em> is unimpeachably one of the best looking sci-fi movies in recent memory, and well worth watching for that fact alone. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="ULQVQY">Alex Proyas’ neo-noir reality-bending movie <em>Dark City</em> came out just a year before <em>The Matrix</em>, and while they were both made in a vacuum, both sets of creators pick at similar themes (and <em>The Matrix </em>even reused some of <em>Dark City</em>’s sets, tying them even closer together). In any case, it’s a dope film.</p>
<p id="xQUljE">Set in a strange, inscrutable city seemingly cast under a veil of perpetual night, the film stars Rufus Sewell as John Murdoch, an amnesiac who mysteriously wakes up in bathtub and finds himself accused of the murder of a young woman. Evading capture, Murdoch wanders through the streets of this metropolis in search of answers to who he was and what happened, all the while stalked by mysterious trench coat-wearing figures who harbor the truth of the city’s true nature and function. </p>
<p id="nVq9uM">With supporting performances by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead; Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch’s wife, Emma; Richard O’Brien as the sinister Mr. Hand; and an incredibly out-of-character performance by Kiefer Sutherland as a nebbish scientist named Daniel Schreber, <em>Dark City</em> may not be the same cultural juggernaut as the Wachowskis’ Matrix franchise, but it certainly stands as one of the most visually memorable and adventurous sci-fi movies of the late ’90s. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="cx2ZcF"><strong>Director: </strong>Val Guest<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Janet Munro, Leo McKern, Edward Judd<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-day-the-earth-caught-fire">Criterion Channel</a>, <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/11174734">Kanopy</a></p>
<p id="QsVA8Q">This haunting, prescient disaster movie from 1961 imagines that the Earth has been knocked out of its orbit by simultaneous nuclear bomb tests conducted by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. As the world tilts off its axis and starts to spiral toward the sun, the poles change and the temperature rises, driving the inhabitants of postwar London into a delirious, sweaty fever. We see all this through the eyes of the journalists of the Daily Express newspaper as they cover the story and report on one last desperate attempt to save the planet.</p>
<p id="R7nApU">Although this British film directed by Hammer veteran Val Guest has a small scope and low budget, it manages to encapsulate the terrifying enormity of the situation through desolate, matte backgrounds; a burnt sepia tint on its crisp, widescreen monochrome photography; and telling details like melting road surfaces, mist rolling off an evaporating River Thames, and the bulky radiator strapped to the roof of every car. To keep the story moving, there’s a sweet romance between leads Edward Judd and Janet Munro, and a businesslike journalistic procedural led by the great Leo McKern as the paper’s science editor. (The film shot at the real Daily Express offices and featured the paper’s real editor, playing himself.)</p>
<p id="FdxrzH">The terrific script, by Guest and playwright Wolf Mankowitz, is spicy, impassioned, and precise in its doomsaying. Looking for a different angle on the then-gathering storm of nuclear apocalypse, Guest and Mankowitz hit upon a prophetic vision of global heating that would end up resonating long beyond the end of the Cold War. <em>The Day the Earth Caught Fire</em>’s<em> </em>bleak but open ending, more effective than any triumph or defeat could be, is even more relevant and chilling now than it was 60 years ago. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="Cn7kW8"><em>Fantastic Planet</em> is one of those films that’s nearly impossible to describe, in part because no explanation can quite convey just how bizarre it is. It’s set on the fictional planet of Ygam, where gigantic blue humanoids (“Draags”) and humans (“Oms”) coexist. Humans are not the protagonists of this society, however. Their existence on Ygam is more akin to that of an insect: wild creatures who are mostly regarded as nuisances, and occasionally enslaved as pets. Their population is controlled through periodic genocide.</p>
<p id="EBR3DM">The film is based on the 1957 novel <em>Oms en série </em>by dental-surgeon-turned-author Stefan Wul, whose reputation for subverting the classic science fiction tropes of the era earned him cult status within the genre. The allegorical aspects of the story are arresting enough on their own, but the big-screen adaptation, coupled with its surrealist paper cutout animation style and psychedelic jazzy soundtrack, is basically a 70-minute-long acid trip. If you’re into that sort of thing, then <em>Fantastic Planet</em> is an absolute must-watch. And if you’re not, well, it’s still a great movie to play in the background at parties. —<em>Tara Long</em></p>

<p id="RdpbGU">Before launching <em>Snowpiercer</em> or setting <em>Okja</em> free, Oscar winner Bong Joon-ho unleashed The Host, a biting creature feature that draws as much from Steven Spielberg’s preoccupation with fatherhood as from American military intervention in South Korea. The tight-knit Park family — including stoic patriarch Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong), his shiftless son Gang-du (regular Bong collaborator Song Kang-ho), and enterprising granddaughter Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung) — find themselves at the center of a monster attack and a government conspiracy. </p>
<p id="mUJe9L">What starts off as a thrilling Godzilla riff, complete with an all-timer of a monster reveal, quickly morphs into what would become Bong’s signature style: a sly satire that’s surprisingly heartfelt. The familiar anger at the sight of incompetent military officials is quickly followed by shocked laughter at the Parks’ overwrought mourning, and later, more than a bit of sympathy for the beast. (OK, maybe that’s just me.) Bong’s nimble filmmaking — combining classic keep-away technique with the boldness of a rising talent — sets a new standard for not just monster films, but, more broadly, for sci-fi storytelling. —<em>Danette Chavez</em></p>

<p id="bg0NAf">Fritz Lang’s 1927 silent masterpiece is one of the finest examples of German Expressionism and of science fiction storytelling on film. One of the first feature-length sci-fi movies ever made, <em>Metropolis </em>was a huge undertaking that took multiple years and the modern equivalent of about $24 million to make.</p>
<p id="PIw54e">Set in a dystopian future, <em>Metropolis </em>depicts a class struggle that unfolds around star-crossed lovers on opposite sides of the conflict. At about 150 minutes, it’s one of the longer silent movies from the era, but interested viewers will be rewarded with one of the most influential science fiction movies ever made and some of the most stark architecture and set design ever put on film. It’s a monumental achievement in practical filmmaking that still astonishes to this day, while doubling as a political message for social change. As the film’s closing intertitle says, “The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart.” —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="jC2BFx"><strong>Directors: </strong>Zeek Earl, Chris Caldwell<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Pedro Pascal, Sophie Thatcher, Jay Duplass<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Peacock, <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100014012/prospect">Tubi</a></p>
<p id="IUFkcE"><em>Prospect</em> is the sort of low-budget sci-fi film that punches way above its weight, with an attention to detail and earnest performances that so many blockbuster films lack. The film is about desperate lunar prospectors seeking out precious gems on an alien moon (shot on location in a lushly surreal Pacific Northwest). Pedro Pascal’s performance as a mercenary is a highlight, full of roguish charm and intimidating charisma that makes him instantly captivating whenever he’s on screen.</p>
<p id="qdz0Hu">The practical effects also do an extraordinary job of making this small-scale story feel like part of a much larger universe. For example, the gems sought by every major character in the film must be carefully harvested from fleshy spore pods. This requires an exacting process involving multiple chemical agents and precise timing, lest you spoil the treasure and make it worthless. Not only does this ratchet up the tension in many scenes, it says everything about the setting without saying a word; you quickly see just how hard these characters have to work just for a single little gem. It’s what <em>Prospect</em> is ultimately all about: what it takes to survive out here on the ragged edge. —<em>Clayton Ashley</em></p>

<p id="ZuUJGG"><strong>Director: </strong>Andrei Tarkovsky<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Donatas Banionis, Natalya Bondarchuk, Jüri Järvet<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/videos/solaris">Criterion Channel</a>, <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/7afad950-e9c3-4eec-8c6d-b286c33072ec">Max</a></p>
<p id="rZgvWz">What begins as an investigation into a space station’s severed communication lines becomes a contemplative deep dive into a mind untethered by grief. Although <em>Solaris </em>may be the most approachable of Andrei Tarkovsky’s movies — the Russian director’s portfolio ran the gamut from dazzling to confounding — it’s still one of the denser science fiction epics, acting as a sort of cousin to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. Both movies are obsessed with mining the inexplicable aspects of the cosmos. They also both place bewildered protagonists in situations too vast and complicated to ever understand. But while Kubrick’s adventure into the stars becomes colder and more removed as its run time progresses, <em>Solaris </em>is dead set on celebrating the humanity of its lost explorers, trapped in the orbit of a planet that knows their every regret. —<em>Mike Mahardy</em></p>

<p id="fu0JuW"><strong>Director: </strong>Jo Sung-hee<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Song Joong-ki, Kim Tae-ri, Jin Seon-kyu<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>
<p id="qA1G9N">This Korean space drama is a gorgeous sci-fi blockbuster with a little something for everyone. Jaw-dropping battle sequences in space! A lovable robot who wants to look human! A tough guy who becomes super protective of a vulnerable crewmate! Trenchant commentary on capitalism and how billionaires respond to the climate crisis! Seriously, <em>Space Sweepers </em>has it all.</p>
<p id="BzJ9eV">A crew of lovable scamps comes across a weapon of mass destruction ... that is also a robot child. Their desire for money and their fondness for said robot child clash as they grow into a real family unit together. Made for a fraction of the cost of its Hollywood counterparts, <em>Space Sweepers </em>looks better than most recent American sci-fi blockbusters and is carried by a core group of characters (and actors) that make you want to stay along for the ride well past its 136-minute running time. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="RORGu4"><strong>Director: </strong>Nacho Vigalondo<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Karra Elejalde, Nacho Vigalondo, Candela Fernández<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong><a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/461821/timecrimes">Tubi</a></p>
<p id="dhvMs8">I’m not going to say too much about <em>Timecrimes</em>; this Spanish time-travel chiller from 2007 is really best experienced if you know nothing past its first 10 minutes. A well-to-do, if slightly hangdog, middle-aged suburbanite called Héctor (Karra Elejalde) observes, through binoculars, a young woman take off her clothes and apparently collapse in the woods behind his home. Going to investigate, he is surprised and stabbed in the arm by a mysterious stranger with a bloody, bandaged head. So begins one of the most ingeniously plotted time-travel films of all time, and one of the few pieces of time-travel fiction I’ve ever encountered to successfully close its paradoxical loop — never mind do it so elegantly, and with such a wonderfully tart twist of Hitchcockian bitterness. —<em>OW</em></p>

                <p>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has spoken out to congratulate From Software on Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion breaking a record set by the Polish studio.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree's generally strong reviews have lifted the expansion to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-rated expansion for a role-playing game ever</a>. The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion previously had that honor. "But Elden Ring gets to wear the crown now," CD Projekt Red said.</p><p>"Congratulations to the entire team at From Software on their stellar work!" the studio said.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree, which is out now, takes players to the Realm of Shadow as they take on a variety of new bosses. The expansion also adds new gear, abilities, weapons, and armor.</p><p>"Following in the footsteps of Miquella, the once tarnished legions who rose to Elden Lord may now need to leave their grace behind, as they enter a sinister new chapter and unravel the dark side of the Elden Ring story," reads a line from the expansion's description.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Shadow of the Erdtree, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-guides-hub-classes-summons-and-more/1100-6501032/" data-ref-id="1100-6501032">Shadow of the Erdtree guides hub</a> and our rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-things-to-know/2900-5484/" data-ref-id="2900-5484">14 things to know before jumping in.</a> You can also check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-on-bringing-elden-ring-to-a-close-and-the-future-of-from-software/1100-6524337/" data-ref-id="1100-6524337">interview with Hidetaka Miyazaki about bringing Elden Ring to a close.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arrowhead-games%E2%80%99-discord-communications-are-becoming-a-problem-for-helldivers-2.907869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-games-discord-communications-becoming-problem-for-helldivers-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=arrowhead-games-discord-communications-becoming-problem-for-helldivers-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is now back on track following the prolonged period without patches, and though things are now generally fine, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-the-best-weapons-after-the-viper-commandos-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the infamous Spear launcher</a> is causing crashes left and right. Arrowhead Games acknowledged the problem via Discord, and the community is <em>not</em> happy about that.</p> <p data-characters="644" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">Notably, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dk6sge/to_all_helldivers_please_avoid_using_faf14spear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Games community manager confirmed</a> they’re investigating the Spear as it seems to cause crashes for entire fireteams in combat. It’s good Arrowhead is looking into it, of course, but the issue the community has now is how it’s communicated. The<em> </em>bug isn’t prominently highlighted elsewhere. Those who simply aren’t in the loop with the recent goings-on in <em>Helldivers 2</em> might’ve heard that the Spear was recently buffed, for example, and if they’re not in the game’s official Discord, they’re going to crash the game for their whole squad without knowing why. Not great.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure>  <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">This isn’t the first time that the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community has asked for Arrowhead to communicate via something less transient than Discord, of course. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cktxtb/the_helldivers_official_discord_is_an_unmitigated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1asx1u0/the_helldivers_discord_server_is_an_absolutely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1co1v7z/arrowhead_devs_i_know_its_crazy_out_there_but_why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again</a>, Arrowhead Games’ staff discussed ongoing problems, concerns, and/or simply engaged in dialogue with the players themselves to share helpful information only for it to stay on Discord because it wasn’t shared anywhere else.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">It’s not perfectly clear, of course, what the best alternative to Discord might be, but many players have proposed using the game itself as a news platform of sorts, either by adding a dedicated console to the Super Destroyer that players could use to get up-to-speed, or by repurposing the integrated news system to announce bugs, updates, and other such items.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">It would be easier still, of course, to simply rely more on other social media, Steam, and the PlayStation Network to announce news and get more players informed of what’s going on in the background. Whatever options Arrowhead ends up settling on, the community’s requests are clear: Discord shouldn’t be the sole source of <em>Helldivers 2</em> news at this point.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="846" data-injectable="false">Now, it’s worth remembering that Arrowhead has been – slowly but certainly – making <em>Helldivers 2</em> way less obfuscating over time. For example, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/next-helldivers-2-patch-adds-visible-supply-lines-reworked-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest major update</a> straight-up displayed the planetary supply lines that have been in place from day one, but weren’t actually visible outside of the game’s API. This shows a willingness to improve, but Arrowhead clearly still has some ways to go before the community is happy with its efforts. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-boys-season-4-is-up-21-on-viewership-from-season-3/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-boys-season-4-is-up-21-on-viewership-from-season-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Boys </em>Season 4 has soared in terms of viewership on Prime Video, with a 21% viewership increase as compared to Season 3, per Amazon (via <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-boys-season-4-premiere-viewership-prime-video/">TheWrap</a>). Amazon has also stated that <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 is now the second most-viewed Prime Video season within four days of its premiere, only behind <em>Reacher</em> Season 2.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Moreover, <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 is currently the top show on Prime Video in 160 countries, with 60% of the audience from regions outside the US. It has also been revealed that Brazil, UK, and India are the regions where <em>The Boys</em> is performing really well.</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, the viewership record has arrived after the vitriol this season has received so far on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_boys_2019/s04">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 has the lowest audience score of its season so far on the platform, as highlighted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-4-audience-viewership-record/">Screen Rant</a>. This season has a 50% audience score with an aggregate 2.9 rating out of 5, at the time of writing. However, <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 carries a solid 95% score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">While there are several negative reviews from users who feel that the show is not living up to its standards, other negative reviews are review-bombs that stem from allegations that the show has gone “woke”.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Eric Kripke, the creator of the show, responded to this, in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-boys-showrunner-erik-kripke-interview-trumpism-1235914642/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, by saying: “Go watch something else”. There are now negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes that actually refer to Kripke’s comments as well, highlighting that the statement did not sit well with some fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">One of the users who gave <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 half-a-star in their review wrote, “The creator of the show wanted people to go watch something else, I will obey.”</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Regardless of the review-bombing, the viewership records tell a different story. <em>The Boys</em> is officially set to receive another season which will <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-boys-season-5-final-season-1236033418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be the final chapter</a> of this dark take on the superhero genre.</p>

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the things that makes <em>Minecraft</em> so popular and accessible is its many ports to multiple systems. It even made its way to ChromeOS and Apple TV. However, for some reason, there’s never been a native version of the game on PlayStation 5. Until now, that is.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">As of yesterday, Mojang Studios has made its gaming behemoth <em>Minecraft</em> available on the console, although it is just a preview for now. In a recent post on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, the developer invites people to check out the PS5 version, which you can access if you have it for PS4 by “navigating to ‘Settings’ and then ‘Preview’ within the game.”</p> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">Quite why it’s taken this long to roll out a current-gen version of it on the Sony system is not clear, but it’s here now, and you can enjoy all the same benefits as the Xbox Series port. Well, almost all the benefits.</p> <h2 id="h-what-you-can-and-can-t-do-in-the-ps5-version-of-minecraft" data-injectable="false">What you can and can’t do in the PS5 version of Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s just a preview so far, you’ll still get access to <em>Minecraft</em> in its entirety. However, there are some things you won’t have until the final release. For example, Mojang says while there is multiplayer in the PS5 version, there’s no cross-play, except with the PS4. Also, for obvious reasons, you can’t play this port on previous-gen hardware.</p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">However, you can cross-play if you use Realms – the subscription-based servers for <em>Minecraft</em> – which is available on the PlayStation 5 preview. But you don’t have access to the Minecraft Store currently, though you will get the new “Tricky Trials Update” with the download.</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">Essentially, this is a testing ground for running the game natively on the PS5, which is something the studio does quite often. As such, this particular build is likely to be “unstable” and “not representative of the final version quality.” With these previews, players are encouraged to send feedback and <a href="http://bugs.mojang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submit bug reports</a> to the developer. As for when the full version will be getting a release, there’s no word on that yet.</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="false">Still pulling in millions of players after all this time, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-at-15-ish-heres-what-people-thought-of-the-game-when-it-first-went-public/"><em>Minecraft</em> recently celebrated its 15th birthday</a>. I still remember the first time I played it, not long after it went into beta. It’s been quite the trajectory for the sandbox game that went from a single person’s passion project to dominating the video gaming landscape for the better part of a decade. Maybe its popularity has waned slightly over the years, but I will always find myself back in its blocky world from time to time.</p>

		<p>It’s getting to be pretty toasty out there, as summer feels like it’s truly arrived in the UK, just in time for last night’s Summer Solstice. Did you mark Midsummer’s night in any way? Perhaps you just looked out the window around 9:30PM and thought “Huh, it’s still pretty bright out, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>This week I’ve been playing more of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD for our upcoming review of the Switch remaster, as well as returning to Crime Boss: Rockay City, to see how it’s come along for the Steam launch this week. I’ve also shared some quick thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/20/cat-quest-3-preview-a-purrfectly-piratical-adventure/">Cat Quest 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-is-the-remake-this-legendary-rpg-deserves/">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, and have some more games to talk about next week.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played SteamWorld Dig 2 this week, saying it’s “the perfect sequel to the original, with a fun story and fun gameplay.” I couldn’t agree more, and love its really distinctive take on the Metroidvania form.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> has been away on holiday, and so has been leaning in on local multiplayer gaming. That’s meant&nbsp;TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge,<br>
Guacamelee!, Overcooked! 2 and Cake Bash, and he can heartily recommend the lot of them!</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has naturally mixed together Destiny 2 with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> to wrap up our review, but has also been playing with Cubase and his CDJs as he’s got a big gig… tonight!</p>

<p>It was also Still Wakes the Deep for <strong>Nick</strong>, “which is very good.” And on the side, he’s been playing Street Fighter 6, Dead by Daylight and WWE 2K24.</p>
<p>Gamoc has had Minecraft with an S-tonne of mods, then Minecraft with a quarter tonne of mods. He’s also played Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, “which is basically a Freelancer clone”, as well as Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, “which continues to be excellent but crashy.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with Steve:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have played some Survival: Fountain of Youth and Hauntii, just started Still Wakes the Deep which is braw (that’s Scots slang for good). My main gaming time involved my usual masochistic Next Fest Demo binge with about 120 demos played over the week (don’t ask me why, it’s just become a thing) including a fair few hours with Once Human – preview of this coming up soon. Loads of really exciting titles now added to my wishlist but desperately hoping that the PT ‘inspired’ horror game runs its course soon as almost every other horror tagged demo felt like the same house (often actually is the same Unity asset pack).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now then, what have you played? Holler in the comments below!</p>

The challenge with these emulators is that they don’t include any games. They rely on ROMs, digital copies of classic video games, that are plagued with complicated legal questions&nbsp;when it comes to using and acquiring them.</p><p>Antstream features a library of legally licensed retro titles that’s similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay">Evercade lineup</a> of gaming consoles, so users don’t have to visit the dark corners of the web to source their own. </p><p>There are <a href="https://www.antstream.com/games">hundreds of titles from ancient platforms</a> like the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore Amiga, but you’ll find just 28 Atari 2600 games, five from the Game Boy, two from the original PlayStation, and 42 from the Super Nintendo. So, even with 1,300-plus games offered through the Antstream service, you might have to dig a little to find something you’ll actually want to play.</p><p>As much as we enjoyed the <em>Super Star Wars</em> trilogy on the SNES, that might not be enough to justify the price of an Antstream subscription. For a limited time after launching on the App Store on June 27th, subscriptions will be discounted to $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, which is just slightly cheaper than the standard $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year that Antstream usually charges.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/heavily-modded-cyberpunk-2077-aims-to-imitate-real-life-with-over-300-mods-on-an-rtx-4090/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>German YouTube channel 'Digital Dreams' has released a new Cyberpunk 2077 showcase, aiming to imitate real life.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-unmatched-realism-path-tracing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered plenty of graphical showcases</a> for CDPR's hit title, including several <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-100-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Digital Dreams</a>. Last year, we covered a showcase of the game running in 4K resolution with more than 100 mods, and today we wanted to share an impressive showcase of the game running in 8K resolution with over 300 mods on an NVIDIA RTX 4090. For the video, the content creator has used his own custom ReShade preset alongside an ultra path tracing mod as well as a real weather mod to simulate real life. As said, more than 300 mods were used in order to create this showcase, and the complete list of mods <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/haskeer212/mods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be downloaded via Nexusmods here</a>.</p>
<p>As expected, you'll need quite the setup in order to run CDPR's game with this many mods in 8K resolution. The following configuration was used:</p>
<ul>
<li>MB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gigabyte Aorus X670 AX</li>
<li>CPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryzen 9 7950x</li>
<li>RAM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingston Fury 6000MHz</li>
<li>GPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA RTX 4090</li>
<li>M2 SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung 970 evo</li>
<li>SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucial MX500 2TB</li>
<li>HDD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate Barracuda 14TB</li>
<li>AIO WC:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artic Liquid Freezer 420</li>
<li>PSU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be quiet! Straight Power</li>
<li>Fans:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arctic P12</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the new Cyberpunk 2077 8K showcase below and tell us what you think:</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As reported back in January of this year</a>, the Phantom Liberty expansion has sold more than 5 million units in 2023. It will be interesting to see how further sales for both Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty will evolve over time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-native-4k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-latest-trailer-shows-the-game-at-native-4k-resolution.907845/</guid>

			<p>The latest Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater showed the game running at native 4K resolution, as well as a very faithful recreation of some the original release's cutscenes.</p>
<p>A new analysis shared today by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry</a> confirms how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/">trailer</a> showed almost two weeks back during this year's Xbox Games Showcase featured the remake running at native 4K resolution, with dynamic resolution scaling kicking in rarely. Unfortunately, it hasn't been specified from which version of the game the footage was captured, so it's too early to say if the console versions will indeed run at native 4K resolution, at least in the Quality or Graphics mode the game is likely to feature.</p>
<p>The video also features some very interesting comparisons between some of the original version's cutscenes and their Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater recreations, highlighting how the remake will essentially retain the same scene composition of the original while enhancing it using the Unreal Engine 5. In Snake's HALO jump cutscene that opens the game, for example, the engine's more accurate lighting allows more detailed and diffuse shadows across the characters while ambient occlusion shades in under collars and beneath hair. High-quality assets, improved reflections, more realistic cloud rendering, and better lens flare also play a big part in making the cutscene look amazing. The Unreal Engine 5 also allowed the developer to massively improve character rendering, as all characters sport new facial details, which make them look great even with the animations and motion capture used in the original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - UE5 Remake vs Original - How Does the Trailer Stack Up?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmPyKTtaxhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182791/kingdom-planet-apes-4k-blu-ray-special-feature-no-cgi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SOK167">It’s no secret that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152375/kingdom-planet-apes-visual-effects-weta-fx-mocap"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a visual-effects-heavy movie</a>. After all, there are only two human characters, and every other speaking part in the movie belongs to a CGI ape. But just because there are a lot of digital characters doesn’t mean the actors portraying them weren’t giving full performances. In fact, most of the characters were fully motion-captured, and the movie’s 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is here to prove it. </p>
<p id="4lgc7A">The<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet</em> <em>of the Apes</em></a> 4K set includes a special version of the movie, dubbed <em>The Raw Cut</em>, that’s a split-screen version of the entire movie — one side is the finished film and the other is stripped of all the film’s visual effects. In other words, it’s just the actors in their mocap suits acting out the scenes as their ape characters. (<em>The Raw Cut</em> is not included in the Blu-ray or DVD releases of the movie — just the 4K Blu-ray.) </p>
<p id="t4Ys2E">On the one hand, this is probably a very awkward way to watch the movie in which you’re constantly confronted with the fact that the whole thing is just a bunch of people pretending to be monkeys. On the other hand, <em>The Raw Cut</em> is an excellent way to show off just how much work the actors are doing and how incredible their full-body performances are. </p>
<p id="xBPIzy">Showcasing the work of motion capture actors has never really been easy. First popularized with Andy Serkis’ performance as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9HWSuptvNc">Gollum in <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em></a> in 2002, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NU9ikjqjC0">unfinished footage of actors performing in mocap suits</a> has provided insight into just how complicated the process is and how intricate the physical performance can be. But this <em>Kingdom </em>special feature shows one way filmmakers can show off just how incredible their films’ performers are, which is why it should become standard for every visual effects-heavy movie. </p>
<p id="SJsySE">The 4K UHD Blu-ray version of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is set to be released on Aug. 27. <em>The Raw Cut</em> will also include an optional commentary track featuring director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145926/zelda-movie-director-wes-ball-grounded-style">Wes Ball</a>, editor Dan Zimmerman, and VFX supervisor Erik Winquist. </p>

That perception has followed the character ever since and misunderstands Marsden’s portrayal of the character on screen. The films heavily rely on the love triangle between Cyclops, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188">Wolverine</a></span>, and Jean Grey. Wolverine is seen as the bad boy archetype, and naturally Cyclops is the opposite. </p><figure id="" data-id="b8cc7cf9f195d49de63b760da5b49116" data-recommend-id="image://b8cc7cf9f195d49de63b760da5b49116" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="James Marsden wears red sunglasses as cyclops" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="James Marsden wears red sunglasses as cyclops" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8cc7cf9f195d49de63b760da5b49116" data-recommend-id="image://b8cc7cf9f195d49de63b760da5b49116" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="James Marsden wears red sunglasses as cyclops" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, there are many moments throughout the trilogy where we see Cyclops’ charm and ego come through. A lot of that happens in his scenes with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-wolverine-kevin-feige-hugh-jackman-return-1851454319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-wolverine-kevin-feige-hugh-jackman-return-1851454319">Hugh Jackman</a></span>’s Wolverine, which start as two guys butting heads over a girl and grow into a begrudging bromance filled with constant teasing. As for the power potential of Cyclops, we constantly see him holding back. On a character level, this reflects his stance as team leader and one of the first students of Charles Xavier, who taught Cyclops he needed to control his powers to not scare humans. However, while in mourning for Jean, we do see him let his powers loose at the beginning of <em>X-Men: The Last Stand.</em></p><p>For many, the seemingly boring portrayal of Cyclops became the only version that existed. It wasn’t until <em>X-Men ‘97</em> that people really saw Cyclops as cool again, but this ignores a vital part of the puzzle—the comics. In the past two decades, Cyclops’s comic arc has been anything but boring. Starting in the 2000s with Grant Morrison’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472"><em>New X-Me</em>n</a></span>, Cyclops is portrayed as a powerful team leader constantly at the forefront of the action. He’s one of the most important characters in Morrison’s entire run and constantly shows his combat and leadership prowess while also going through some compelling emotional journeys. The 2010s saw Cyclops become arguably the most important<em> X-Men </em>character in the comics, starting with <em>Avengers vs. X-Men</em>. In this story, Scott gains the power of the phoenix force and starts a massive conflict with the rest of Earth’s heroes that eventually leads to him <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-kills-superhero-icon-avengers-369942/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-kills-superhero-icon-avengers-369942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killing Charles Xavier</a></span>.

In Bendis’s run, Cyclops has become disillusioned with the decades-long fight of Charles Xavier being predicated on appearing as harmless as possible to humans, often at the cost of mutant safety. Cyclops is branded a terrorist and dedicates himself to a mission of saving persecuted mutants and fighting against the many groups trying to eradicate the species.<br></p><p>While I understand that the majority of people may have a picture of Cyclops based on the movies and other screen adaptations, I don’t think it’s fair to expect those to give the whole picture of a character’s identity. Also, I don’t actually think the movies do Cyclops as dirty as everybody says. But even if we want to argue that the movies give Cyclops a bad portrayal, it’s only one part of the picture, and in the two decades since James Marsden first appeared on screen as Cyclops, in the comics the character has continued being just as badass as fans have always known him to be. <em>X-Men ‘97</em> just reiterated what was always true about him. So don’t call it a redemption.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s now pivoted to a completely different genre with <em>Nine Sols</em>, a side-scrolling action game in the mold of a 2D <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Combat is elegant, methodical and punishing as you journey through a gorgeous “Taopunk” world in search of revenge. The story is interesting, but sometimes feels like it’s intruding on the flow of the exploration and action. Fighting enemies, on the other hand, including bosses, feels crisp and rewarding. </p><p><br>There’s a deflection mechanic where timed parries build up chi that can be used to unleash exploding talisman attacks. You also take two types of damage, one of which you can recover from by not getting hit. Add in a long-range bow and sizable skill tree and there’s a ton of interesting stuff going on in <em>Nine Sols</em> that sets its encounters apart from your standard, dime-store Soulsborne Metroidvanias (even the ones I love). I’m pleasantly impressed so far, and while there’s not a Switch version yet, it reportedly runs great on Steam Deck. — Ethan Gach <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-recommend-id="image://abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-recommend-id="image://abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS4.

But despite all of that, <em>Inquisition </em>is probably my least replayed BioWare game from the past 20 years.</p><p><br><em>The Veilguard </em>is building off that game’s final moments, to the point where I can’t in good conscience recommend you play the new game without going back and playing <em>Inquisition </em>at least once. But maybe it’s time for my fourth playthrough. I miss my Tevinter husband. I miss watching the world of Thedas change before my eyes.

I remember liking it a lot! But I’ve not gone back to it much since it was first released. I’ve not even played the two DLC packs that came out later. I’m not sure why. Perhaps its launching right as covid lockdowns began and my wife lost her job, soured me on it. Or maybe those damn Marauders annoyed me too much. Who can say? Regardless, <em>Doom Eternal </em>and its DLC went on sale on Xbox and I decided to grab it and replay it on Xbox Series X at 120 FPS. </p><p><br>And folks, did you know that <em>Doom Eternal</em> is a really good game? I still think the game is a bit over-designed—having to balance grenades, a flamethrower, multiple mods, runes, and more doesn’t feel like <em>Doom</em>—but it’s still a blast. Whipping around rooms and dropping enemies with a shotgun still feels great. I can’t wait to play <em>Doom The Dark Ages</em> next year.

I won’t divulge <em>exactly </em>how far behind I am out of shame, but I’m deep into some really cool shit, and even if I’m not entirely caught up by the time <em>Dawntrail </em>launches, I’m just glad to be carving out time for this game again. I know that I love a bunch of other games more than I love this one, but I don’t know that many other worlds and characters feel as comforting to just come back to as the ones in <em>FF14</em>.

But even FromSoftware knows a fair warning about what’s coming can go a hell of a long way. So, take it from one who has traversed the Realm of Shadow and (sorta) lived to tell the tale, there’s a few things I can tell those who will be walking in Miquella the Kind’s footsteps.

While those two boss fights are optional to get to the base game’s ending, they’re now required to be able to access the DLC.</p><p>For returning Tarnished for whom Mohg’s already dead, the entrance to the DLC is right in Mohg’s boss room, southeast on the Underground map. The Site of Grace is called Cocoon of the Empyrean. You’ll know you’re good to go, because there’ll be an NPC there to bid you welcome. When you’re ready, interact with the arm sticking out of the cocoon, and strap in.</p><figure id="" data-id="5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-recommend-id="image://5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-recommend-id="image://5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123355"><a id=""></a><strong>And you <em>did</em> actually install the DLC, right?</strong></h2><div><p>It’s not as bizarre a question as you might think. I’ve spoken to multiple folks before launch who had a similar problem, where Radahn and Mohg are dead, but there’s no prompt at the cocoon. Well, as it turns out, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is its own separate install from the main game, and while buying it unlocks access to it, it doesn’t seem to automatically download the extra data. If you wanna make absolutely sure, on PS5 and Xbox, from the main menu, press Start/Options on the tile for <em>Elden Ring</em>, go to Manage Game, and while <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> should be there, it may require a proper download, which will be another 16GB.</p></div><h2 id="h123356"><a id=""></a><strong>Make sure to look out for Miquella’s Crosses</strong></h2><p>One of the first things you’ll notice when you start out on the Gravesite Plain, aside from one of those wild chakram ninja things kicking your ass, is there’s a new symbol visible on the road, a golden cross with a crescent moon.</p><div><p>It looks kinda like those crosses the people who got Tanged in <em>End of Evangelion</em> turn into. Turns out, that’s kind of an apt comparison too: These are Miquella’s Crosses, and while not all of them have a Site of Grace nearby, the ones that don’t all have a Scadutree Fragment—<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s new stat-enhancing items. Also, they typically have an NPC who’ll reveal a little more about what exactly is going on in the Realm of Shadow. These are also the folks you’ll be able to summon during the critical path boss fights. Make friends with them, they’re nice. Not by choice, but still.</p><p>These markers also serve a nifty passive purpose. Interact with them, and you’ll read the words carved into them by Miquella. The vast majority will just tell you that here, Miquella abandoned his flesh, but the mission-critical areas of the DLC will detail a body part Miquella shed here. A new body part notes you’ve reached the next stage of the story, and this means, unless you’re in a big rush to see the ending, it’s worth going back where you came from to explore more. Why? Because what’s next is definitely about to mess your shit up in a novel way. Speaking of....</p></div><figure id="" data-id="d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-recommend-id="image://d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-recommend-id="image://d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123357"><a id=""></a><strong>The enemies are gonna hit a whole lot harder</strong></h2><p>If you’ve already beaten Radagon and the Elden Beast at least once, you’re in a good place to tackle the DLC from a sheer skill perspective. In terms of raw numbers, I’d recommend being at around the level 120 mark before jumping in.</p><p>For this writer’s part, going into it, my main character was a lvl 157 tank on two legs wearing the Bull-God armor set with a Dragon Towershield. Some of the most dangerous bastards walking the Lands Between have tried to put a dent in me and had all the impact of a spitball. And then I walked into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and spent the first few hours getting clapped up in two hits by basic enemies.</p><p>Sure, being high-leveled is a nice idea, especially since weapons and magic are just as effective as before, but even at high levels, the attack stats on the new enemies wandering the Realm of Shadow scale up accordingly. For quite some time, if you don’t respect their damage output, they will put an end to your journey in a hurry. Even more than the base game, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is less about how much you can get hit and keep getting back up, but rather avoiding getting hit as much as humanly possible. That means, for tanks, you’re definitely going to want to find a way to knock your Equipment Load down to a point where you keep a medium roll. You’re gonna need it.</p><h2 id="h123358"><a id=""></a><strong>Hunt down all the new enhancement items</strong></h2><div><p>So, the good news is that even though it’s still gonna kick your ass, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has its own special enhancement items to jack up your stats throughout your journey. Scadutree Blessings can be found at every single one of Miquella’s crosses, as well as a special drop if you chase down any of the shadowy folks carrying pots on their heads. These specifically boost your attack and defense stats. Meanwhile, Revered Spirit Ash Blessings can be found on statues of Miquella found throughout the Shadow Realm. These power up your Spirit Ashes, though you can’t actually see those numbers nor how much they go up.</p><p>Both work much like Golden Seeds, in that you’ll need more and more of them to level up over time. In the early going, it’s worth wandering around the Gravesite Plains areas before Ellac Greatbridge to collect the first few, in order to make earlier major challenges a bit easier on yourself. Oh, and there is one major downside: they’re only effective in the Realm of Shadow. So don’t go thinking you’ll get out of here and one-shot Malenia or something.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-recommend-id="image://9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-recommend-id="image://9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123359"><a id=""></a><strong>Know what you’re fighting for</strong></h2><p>There are a few different types of minor Dungeons scattered around <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Shadow Realm. If you’ve frequently run into that dilemma of wondering if all the beatdowns you’re about to take will be worth the risk, let’s make it nice and simple:</p><p>If it’s a Catacomb, you’re getting a Glovewort by the end (i.e. the items you need to level up Spirit Ashes) and a new Spirit Ash.</p><p>Ruined Forges will get you weaponry (and, usually, a bunch of the resources you need to upgrade them).</p><div><p>If it’s a Gaol, you’re getting a Hefty Pot.</p></div><h2 id="h123360"><a id=""></a><strong>Go west, life is slightly less terrifyingly violent there</strong></h2><p>Near the start of the DLC, you’ll literally come to a crossroads. One direction leads across a massive bridge with a gorgeous view, another leads to an imposing castle guarded by a giant scorpion, and the last leads to a swamp and a diseased village.</p><p>Not that we’re telling you what to do, it’s your life, but we strongly suggest taking the road west to Belurat first. For one thing, there’s another Miquella cross in front of it for an easy Scadutree Fragment. For another, there are two other NPCs to meet over there. And third, despite being a fairly lengthy area, it’s actually maybe the “easiest” task to take on in the early going.</p><div><p>The place is loaded with at least one new and useful item for any and every class. The boss, Dancing Lion, is no joke, and may put you in the dirt a few times, but the reward for taking him down is one of the most versatile (if obstructive) pieces of armor in the early game: the Divine Beast Head. At this stage, it all leads to a dead end at the top of the tower, but, when you’re headed back out and east a few levels stronger, you’ll be thankful for the detour.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-recommend-id="image://10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-recommend-id="image://10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h123361"><a id=""></a><strong>Look up (and down) more</strong></h2><p><br>One of the fascinating things about the Realm of Shadow is that it’s a lot more vertical than much of the Lands Between. Objectives are often further up than you think, the best way out of a sticky situation may be the platform 100 feet under you. Meanwhile, shortcuts into special areas might need you to go spelunking without a parachute.</p><p>As such, it’s an extremely good idea, if you haven’t already, to pump a few more points into Dexterity, since it governs your fall damage. Yes, you can do that old trick of stripping off your armor and jumping down, but there are a few of those types of jumps where there’s a group of new, extremely trigger-happy baddies waiting at the bottom. Tread lightly, but not stupidly.</p><h2 id="h123362"><a id=""></a><strong>You don’t need to just march right into Shadow Keep</strong></h2><p><br>Once you’ve looted the Gravesite Plains area and made it to Scadu Altus, the next big obstacle is the Shadow Keep. It’s a massive, ruined kingdom full of magic, mystery, and, for some reason, giant crabs. It’s actually so massive that it almost functions as its own little contained overworld. Sure, you can walk up to the front door and knock, but there are a couple of side entrances and exits as well, with switches and secrets that unlock other parts of the keep for exploration. And of course a couple of hard-as-nails boss fights in there too. The Scadutree Avatar, in particular, can kiss the blackest part of my ass. A three-phase battle? At that part of the game? In this economy?</p><p>Anyway, point being, you’re going to hit a big brutal wall at a few points tackling this place, and it’s worth remembering it’s worth maybe circling around a bit, especially to the west, and finding another way in, or indeed looking around for some new ways to kill some of the high-level baddies roaming around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Red Faction sequel was pitched and approved by Embracer before studio closures and job cuts killed the project. That’s according to a new report from<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Rock Paper Shotgun</a> (RPS), that claims Embracer canceled a “visual prototype” for a Red Faction sequel in 2023.</p>



<p>Developer Fishlabs worked on it internally as Project White, and was working to develop something along the lines of 2009’s Red Faction: Guerilla. The pitch involved the aforementioned visual prototype to show to direct parent Plaion for approval.</p>



<p>According to the report, the game was pitches “several times” to Plaion, with an elaborate one happening in November 2023. That pitch, RPS says, also featured cosplay for the executives.</p>



<p>“In addition to screening the “fake trailer”, team members posed as characters from the game, with the Red Faction resistance group “hacking” a presentation given by a sinister corporate agent,” the story reads.</p>



<p>According to what RPS was told, reaction to the pitch was positive with a belief that the game would be greenlit for development. That ultimately didn’t happen after an internal vote was split 50-50, halting any chance of the game’s creation. After the game’s cancellation, Fishlabs management was told to “lay off almost everyone not attached to an active game project.”</p>



<p>As far as what the game would’ve been about, the new Red Faction game would’ve been set 100 years after Guerilla on a “more terraformed and colorful Martian world map.”</p>



<p>“There were plans for a female protagonist, who would once again take part in an underground workers revolution,” RPS said. “There would likely have been a range of factions, from predatory corporations to homegrown Martian communities, with whom you might have had to forge alliances to complete your objectives.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer, Plaion, and Fishlabs for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-saved-metroid<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Has any Nintendo hardware done more for Metroid than the Nintendo Switch? Sure, the SNES is home to the best Metroid game of all time and the GameCube ushered in a revolutionary perspective change. But now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond coming to the Nintendo Switch in 2025, and nearly every other great Metroid game available to play on the handheld, it’s time to ask the question: Did the Nintendo Switch save Metroid?</p><p>It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Metroid was, at one point, very much at risk of being shelved. Metroid has never moved <em>serious</em> numbers and <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>according to all available data</u></a>, the total sales for <em>every</em> Metroid game combined is somewhere around 22 million units. To put that into perspective, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild alone has sold 32 million copies. </p><p>But what Metroid and Samus lacked in sales success, it more than made up for it in brand recognition. Nintendo fans who don’t like Metroid games at least know of it, and Super Smash Bros. kept Samus in front of gamers for years, even when there weren’t new Metroid games to play. Now, on the Nintendo Switch, Samus is ever-present, even if that wasn’t always the case.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announcement-trailer-nintendo-switch-0-33-screenshot-1718722693568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Metroid Prime 4 is real and coming to Switch. Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of Nintendo’s many beloved characters, perhaps nobody is as fascinating as the enigmatic bounty hunter, Samus Aran. When Metroid was released in 1986, the sci-fi, Alien-inspired search-action game was released and would go on to spawn a genre unto itself.</p><p>For older Nintendo gamers looking for something new, Metroid was a revelation. Where Zelda and Mario put players in wide, open worlds of bright hues, Metroid was dark and cramped. Its creature designs were downright terrifying and the central Metroid plotline was a direct reference to one of cinema’s scariest, face-hugging aliens. </p><p>Metroid filled a more mature niche within the Nintendo stable, but as a result never found the same financial success as the more all-ages games. </p><p>In 2010 Nintendo released Metroid: Other M to tepid sales and perhaps worse critical reception. Commercial disaster and the inability to recapture the magic of Metroid Prime could have spelled the end of Samus. It didn’t, but it did take six years before the next Metroid game was released, the very-much forgotten Metroid Prime: Federation Force (coincidentally a minor character from that 3DS game is apparently a main villain in Metroid Prime 4). Other than a well-received 3DS remake of Metroid 2 a year later, Samus was all but missing from the Wii U and early Switch years. </p><p>It seems distant now but this was the era Metroid fans began to seriously fret over the future of the series. Other than various re-releases of older Metroid games, the only real project seemingly in development was Metroid Dread, a game that was first referenced during the Nintendo DS era and entered two decades of development hell.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-1633526505786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A shot in the arm. Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread did eventually find its way to the Nintendo Switch</a>, almost 20 years after it began development. Even more surprising, Dread – a throwback to the old 2D style of Metroid games – is the best-selling game in the series at over 3 million units sold. Not Zelda numbers, sure, but the numbers were heading in the right direction.</p><p>Combining the old-school 2D style of Metroid with a Resident Evil 2-like persistent enemy that takes the game to borderline horror territory, Metroid Dread was a shot of adrenaline for the series and quickly became one of the best games to play on the Nintendo Switch. But it’s not just because Nintendo released one of the best Metroid games of all time on the Switch that I believe the handheld console saved Metroid – it’s because Nintendo released <em>all</em> of the best Metroid games on the system.</p><p>Consider the Metroid library currently available on Switch. There’s the aforementioned Dread, a truly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">remarkable remake of Metroid Prime</a>, Metroid Fusion, Super Metroid, the original Metroid, and now Metroid: Zero Mission all available to play on the Switch so long as you have either a digital copy of the game or a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p><p>Almost overnight the Nintendo Switch became the ultimate entryway for old — but more importantly new — fans to discover Metroid. In the digital age, old games in particular are incredibly hard to come by and while Nintendo might not have fans among some sectors of the digital preservation community, the Metroid series at least is thriving on the Switch.</p><p>Some of these games, like the Game Boy Advance titles Metroid: Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion, are still relatively pricey on the secondhand market, while others like the full Metroid Prime Trilogy still remain trapped on obsolete consoles like the Wii. But for curious fans looking to get into the full Metroid offering, they can’t do better than pick up a Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Nintendo has hardly showered any one console with more Metroid than the Nintendo Switch. And given the Switch’s humongous install base, making Metroid easy to access will hopefully only continue to grow that fanbase for the future.</p><p>Now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on the horizon, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/was-metroid-prime-4-running-on-switch-2">still confirmed for the Nintendo Switch</a> rather than the Switch Successor, the Metroid parade on Nintendo’s hybrid system continues. And while individual consoles like the SNES, GameCube, and GameBoy Advance can boast about having released the best Metroid games of their generation, only one system — the Nintendo Switch — has all of them, ready to play at a moment’s notice.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

With the proprietary ThrustmapperX software, you can customize the sensitivity levels of the analog sticks or remap the controller's many buttons.</p><p>Along with tactile buttons, a clicky D-pad, and back buttons, the controller uses locking latches for the triggers so they can be actuated faster than a standard gamepad. The controller's modularity means you can swap around the analog sticks and D-pad to better fit your needs. So regardless of whether you prefer the left analog stick to be above or below the D-pad, the eSwap X2 is a great option.</p><p>Additionally, you can swap out any components that get worn down over the years without needing to replace the entire controller. </p><p>Here's a quick look at what you'll find inside the box:</p><ul><li>eSwap X2 Controller</li><li>2 interchangeable mini-stick modules</li><li>2 interchangeable grip modules</li><li>2 interchangeable triggers</li><li>1 interchangeable D-pad module</li><li>2 additional mini stick caps</li><li>Power cable</li><li>Screwdriver for removing modules</li><li>Storage bag</li><li>Quick Start guide</li></ul><p>The Elden Ring version of the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 controller arrives on September 30. Though it's unfortunate that the controller isn't available for Shadow of the Erdtree's launch, dedicated Elden Ring fans will probably still be playing the expansion a couple months from now. </p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

"Brave Tarnished, we call upon you now. It's time to return to the Lands Between, and enter the Realm of Shadow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Monster Hunter series has been steadily building toward players and the large-scale battles they undertake into a more open world experience. With recent entries leaning into the scope of its setting, Capcom's daunting and equally thrilling monster-slaying action game has grown since finding its way back to consoles after years on handhelds, and the next game is bringing about the most significant changes the series has seen yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the breakthrough success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which brought an even larger audience to the series, Capcom aims to have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shake up the established structure and flow for the series' first open world game. This intended shake-up hinges on bringing the series' epic battles into a more dynamic and interconnected world that's rife with emergent encounters against large-scale creatures and a more hostile ecosystem that evolves in real time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we saw an extended demo of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and spoke with series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka, and game director Yuya Tokuda about how the next game puts its new open world in the spotlight, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/monster-hunter-world-hits-over-23-million-units-sold">the massive success of the series</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has led them to rethink Monster Hunter for a global audience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does an open world structure mean for Monster Hunter?">What does an open world structure mean for Monster Hunter?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since its debut in 2003, the Monster Hunter series has focused on a timed mission-based structure that led players into excursions through connected zones to hunt key targets. This fragmented, excursion-style approach is what the series has been built on, but following the success of Monster Hunter World and its experimentation with a larger sandbox and more narrative worldbuilding—which now stands as Capcom's best-selling game—the shift to a more seamless and dynamic Monster Hunter game was something that executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka felt was vital for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The seamlessness of the game is really one of our core efforts in designing Monster Hunter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and ever since World, we've always wanted to design the ecosystems and the environments more detailed and immersively," said Fujioka. "That aspect necessitates the kind of seamlessness of the world where we can have all these concepts running together, all within an environment that feels threatening and filled with hostile monsters that you can freely hunt."</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much like previous Monster Hunter games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sees players take on the role of hunters contending with an unexplored locale that's teeming with new wildlife to battle and resources to collect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">absolutely retains this conceit, the private demo shown at Summer Game Fest presented a detailed look at an average session in the game, which showed the new systems that actively ditch some of the series' more steadfast and hardened rules as it moves the series to a more seamless and organic world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a clear focus on giving players a more freeform approach to being a hunter of large monsters, allowing for more room to comfortably explore the setting and choose targets without a timer. Instead of starting in the town hub to gain new quests, restock on items, change load-outs, and squad up before going on an instanced expedition, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">now brings a more modern open world experience akin to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, wherein towns, activities, and hunts are within the world and engaged without any loading screens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the demo, the hunter moved from a desert settlement filled with merchants and other explorers into the large biome on their mount. The hunters can now observe and track monsters, including the new herds of roaming monsters in each biome and new plant life and resources to collect with. Along with more monsters and critters, there are also NPC hunters who can join you if you need assistance. After completing a hunt, the player can keep exploring to try another hunt or retreat to town or an improvised camp in the field to cook food and recover.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A clear focus with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that the developers are more focused on keeping players in the world, instead of being ferried back to safety to start a new mission. By moving Monster Hunter away from the established excursion structure, and into a more explorable and evolving world, the developers want players to be more active in contending with the myriad of systems at work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We also focused a lot on the type of interactions you can find when exploring, like with packs of monsters, chasing down hurt targets, and how they conflict with other human hunters," said the executive director. "We also have these characters with 24-hour patterns of behavior that are much more involved than in previous titles. These details all show not only how seamless and organic the world is, but also how dynamic it feels."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Monster Hunter’s global success is sharping the series’ direction">Monster Hunter’s global success is sharping the series’ direction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other significant innovation in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the new evolving ecosystem, which sees real-time shifts to the weather and monster population. During the demo, we saw a sandstorm occur during a hunt. Conditions got worse when a violent lightning storm kicked in, which made the environment even more hostile. While the devs were chasing the target on their mount, we saw monsters in the areas scurrying to safety to avoid the weather hazards, which heightened the need to complete the hunt quickly. The terrain also became unstable, with one area turning into a massive sand pit that sucked in some minor monsters. This level of emergent, environmental gameplay, somewhat in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is something that the series has toyed with, but now it looks to be far more ingrained in the flow of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds' </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">core gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That dynamic aspect of the world actively becoming hostile towards you, yet still teeming with activity to appreciate, was something that game director Yuya Tokuda wanted for the series. Still, it hasn't been possible till now, thanks to new technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the biggest things that we've been able to challenge ourselves with in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is building out a massive, changing ecosystem that not only incorporates more monsters but other characters within the world that also interact with those monsters," said Tokuda. "Along with those heightened interactions, these different environmental changes are happening simultaneously. That's something that the technology we have now has made possible, which we couldn't do before, and I think we did a good job bringing that all together."</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Monster Hunter games have been about the experience of being a hunter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and its focus on having players contend with the environment while keeping their targets in sight, heightens that by adding somewhat of a survivalist twist. With players having to compete in an open world with an evolving ecosystem and more active shifting of flora and fauna, the hunters in the game will have to be more adaptable to change— which includes building camps (that can be destroyed by monsters) and using new gadgets like camouflage to stay in hiding. Coupled with a more fleshed-out and structured world to explore, it's an intriguing and sensible shift for the series that really ups the hunter experience that the series excels at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter World </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">offered some important lessons for Capcom—not only in terms of building up the next Monster Hunter game but also for making a new game that feels modern and in tune with the series' global audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From the get-go, we approached Monster Hunter World with a global mindset," said Tsujimoto. "At that point, we had approached things by releasing in Japan first and following up with other territories, but World was our first worldwide simultaneous release for Monster Hunter. It was also the first game we made with so many forms of localization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That seems obvious to say, but that was a challenge for us initially because, with that global approach, we had to open up the series to other Capcom members across the globe to give opinions and input on the kind of direction the series would be going on," he continued. "That was a great challenge and lesson for us, but another thing we learned and wanted to focus on more with Wilds was taking greater consideration and care for players who haven't played Monster Hunter in a long time and how we can kind of get them back in the saddle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given how the series had steadily grown and built up a large audience to become one of Capcom's key franchises, seeing Monster Hunter embrace a more open world experience, leaning further into the epic scale of the battles and environments, is exciting. It also showcases the immense growth that Capcom has had in the last decade with its focus on reinvesting in its core franchises—much like Resident Evil, the Monster Hunter series is also going through its own transformation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By moving away from its modest and old-fashioned structure to a more open-ended game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcases just how weird and wondrous the Monster Hunter universe has always been. It looks to be the series' first true effort for players to really get to know its setting on a moment-to-moment scale—and that's a great change for the series.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p>Microsoft has issued an official statement about the recent Xbox Black Myth Wukong delay.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X and Series S versions of Game Science's highly-anticipated Black Myth Wukong were recently delayed.</p>
<p>While an August 24 release was confirmed for both PC and PS5, the Xbox versions were delayed indefinitely for optimization reasons. "PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024", the official FAQ reads. "We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards."</p>
<p>Following the delay, many suggested that the lower-powered Xbox Series S might be causing problems when it comes to optimizing the game. While we don't know if this is the case, an official statement from Microsoft (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> WindowsCentral), might suggest that that there's some sort of exclusivity deal in place. While the statement doesn't directly state as much, one reading between the lines could argue that this might be the case. "<em>We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. <strong>We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders</strong>, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</em></p>
<p>As noted by WindowsCentral, Game Science has already announced that the game would be coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. As such, exclusivity deals are a bit of a problem for Game Science. Then again, Microsoft hasn't directly said that this is the case, and this is merely speculation at this point.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this matter? Is Black Myth Wukong indeed struggling on the Series S? Or might Sony have struck some sort of timed-exclusivity deal with Game Science? Only time will, but you might as well let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 24 for PlayStation 5 and PC. Be sure to also check out the trailer that Game Science <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last month.</p>

Currently, the community is full of posts of players being taken aback by just how hard the new content is. Everyone had a sense it would be extra challenging.

In part that’s because <em>Erdtree </em>contains a new Scadutree Fragments-based upgrade system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl3hyn/unpopular_opinion_new_difficulty_system_is_badly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl3hyn/unpopular_opinion_new_difficulty_system_is_badly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to make characters more powerful</a></span>.

I suspect that as players explore more of <em>Erdtree</em> they’ll figure out ways to conquer its challenges and potential builds that might save them from getting pummeled to death in a lightning-quick tw0-second combo. And that’s one of the best parts of <em>Elden Ring</em>: players meeting up IRL and online to swap stories of narrowly overcoming the odds and the strategies that finally helped them do it. And it sounds like <em>Erdtree</em> will require that kind of community collaboration even more than the base game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report</a> from journalist Jez Corden of Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson issued a statement about the Black Myth: Wukong Xbox delay.</p>



<p>The spokesperson reportedly gave Corden the following statement:</p>



<p><em>“We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</em></p>



<p>The statement is careful to remain vague, and it does not address concerns over the Xbox Series S console.</p>



<p>Corden does not confirm anything, either. But they speculate that by “reading between the lines,” it’s possible Xbox is referring to an exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Fans originally expected Black Myth: Wukong to release on Xbox at launch, alongside PC and PlayStation. However, developer Game Science <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently confirmed</a> the delay for Black Myth: Wukong’s Xbox version.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a> update, the devs explained that “we are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.”</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is set to release on August 20, 2024, and pre-orders are available now. During the Summer Game Fest 2024 event, the devs revealed all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-pre-order-bonuses-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns.907779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's once again the time of the week when we turn to what's been happening on the business side of things, and this week, three studios have been shut down, so we're off to a pretty glum start already, unfortunately.</p>
<p>A rather bizarre story involving a Polish developer's odd sauna-based requests for potential staff members also surfaced this week, so it certainly hasn't been an uneventful few days.</p>
<p>Here's our latest gaming industry roundup!</p>
<h2>Studio closures abound</h2>
<p>This week saw three studios shutting down, starting with&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Wizard with a Gun&nbsp;</em>developer Galvanic Games</a>, which said earlier this week that the game's sales are "not strong enough to sustain our studio".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-with-a-gun-dev-shut-down-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=BKJwbfkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-with-a-gun-dev-shut-down-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=EL1En6Mm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wizard with a Gun</em>&nbsp;hasn't sold well enough to ensure its studio's continued existence, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>studio Pieces Interactive also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alone-in-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down">closed its doors this week</a>, and while no official reason was given, parent company Embracer Group <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-70-projects">admitted last month</a> that sales for the survival horror reimagining were underwhelming.</p>
<p>The third studio to close down this week was&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>developer Paradox Tectonic, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">shuttered</a> after its game was rather unexpectedly canceled. The move angered at least one former Paradox Tectonic employee, who took to LinkedIn to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-dev-cancellation">share his thoughts in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>
<p>While it hasn't quite closed down,&nbsp;<em>Venture to the Vile&nbsp;</em>developer Cut to Bits also <a href="https://x.com/megamasao/status/1803802074766819726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">let most of its staff go</a> this week, in a rather gloomy coda that belies the increasing sunshine (in the UK, at least).</p>
<h2>Embracer Group's report shows a seismic loss of employees</h2>
<p>Beleaguered holding group Embracer released its annual report this week, and it was full of info regarding the company's future direction, including its focus on projects in the pipeline and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-ai-annual-report">embracing (ahem) of AI</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-layoffs-closures-saints-row-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=N6IkN0Oz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-layoffs-closures-saints-row-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=v-_kF-Rq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Embracer's closures and layoffs have seen over 5,000 employees let go.</figcaption></figure><p>One figure that was notable in the report, however, was the 2023-24 fiscal year's employee total, which numbered "over 11,100", according to Embracer.</p>
<p>Compared to its 2022-23 employee count, that means that over 5,000 Embracer employees have been let go, which includes the thousands of employees divested from the company as part of the sale of Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about what's been going on over at Embracer Group, I'd recommend this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent Rock Paper Shotgun writeup</a>, which discusses the death of a possible&nbsp;<em>Red Faction&nbsp;</em>game and the gutting of&nbsp;<em>Chorus&nbsp;</em>developer Fishlabs.</p>
<h2>EA executives laugh all the way to the bank</h2>
<p>These numbers might paint a pretty glum picture of the gaming industry as it currently stands, but EA's C-suite has nothing to be sad about right now (except, well, being EA's C-suite).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-24-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=EP6CA7XU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-24-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=StnlFFUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA hasn't let layoffs stop it from handing its C-suite a serious amount of cash.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">released its 2024 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement</a>, and in that document, the company discloses that CEO Andrew Wilson made $25.6 million in the 2023-24 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In total, EA's NEOs - that stands for Named Executive Officers, in case you thought it couldn't get any more dystopian - made over $60 million despite the fact that the studio has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off hundreds of employees</a> this year.</p>
<h2>Nintendo is at it again</h2>
<p>Nintendo is no stranger to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-switch-emulator-yuzu-surrender-to-nintendos-demands-and-settle-out-of-court">jealously guarding</a> its IPs from, uh, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-takes-down-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-dx-hd-port-for-pc">fans who want to do something</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-axes-smash-world-tour-without-any-warning">celebrate</a> how much they love those IPs, and this week, the Japanese gaming giant was at it again.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-takedown-wipes-rhythm-heaven-remix-tool-and-250-forks-from-github-240619/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sent a DMCA notice</a> to the creators of a&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>fan tool which allows players to create their own musical remixes, despite the fact that the last official&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>game was released in 2015 on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/3ds-wii-u-online-service-shutdown-date">now-defunct console</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>studio is renowned for its ruthlessness when it comes to shutting down fan projects, but somehow, this one feels particularly cruel. Come on, Nintendo. Give the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>fans a break!</p>
<h2>A story of saunas</h2>
<p>We close today with a rather bizarre story about Polish developer Spectrum Studios, its creative director&nbsp;Jacek Piórkowski, and, uh, saunas.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Piórkowski found himself in hot water (yup) over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spectrum-studios-games_spectrum-studio-is-working-on-new-groundbreaking-activity-7203194177315155970-SO7e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> describing his studio's new game, which is an ambitious-sounding mix of&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>, all with added saunas.</p>
<p>Strangely,&nbsp;Piórkowski said in the post that interested applicants for his studio would need to attend "not negotiable" sauna sessions in order to understand saunas, which are a core part of the game since the player will take the role of a sauna owner.</p>
<p>Piórkowski found himself in further trouble when comments he made to writer Aleksandra Wolna, in which he suggested his "narrative girls" had to visit the sauna with him to come up with an "amazing script", <a href="https://x.com/BartekMoniewski/status/1802787361992138805" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emerged</a>.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/polish-developer-apologises-following-criticism-for-naked-sauna-job-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>,&nbsp;Piórkowski has since "apologized", although his apology contains the usual evasive non-apology statements: "my choice of words was bad", "I didn't state my intentions clearly", et cetera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For her part, Wolna is sad that the sauna controversy took away from the original reason for&nbsp;Piórkowski's comments, which were posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aleksandra-wolna-6736a1227_i-wasnt-paid-cd-action-gave-people-in-my-activity-7207509477401538560-bRgr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of Wolna's posts</a> lamenting a situation of non-payment involving publisher All in!

<p id="uPeLnz">In <em>Altered</em>, players explore a fanciful post-apocalyptic setting where the world outside the city of Asgartha has been completely transformed. It’s up to players to conduct successful expeditions, becoming the first player at the table to reunite their deck’s main character and a lovable sidekick. </p>
<p id="RBfR1G">“It’s a chaotic place with lots of volatile ideas,” said <em>Altered</em> narrative designer Yoshi Mimura. “The [player character] is an Alterer, [and] the power of the Alterer is to shape the world around them so that they can stabilize the regions where they meet to help [make] the world a more sustainable and livable place.”</p>
<p id="tqvI4j">It’s a game about creation, not destruction, and Mimura says that The Sandman has an important role to play.</p>
<p id="YdTH5Q">“Lyra tend to focus on imagination, and stories, and legends, and everything that is transmitted orally,” Mimura said. “The Sandman is kind of a creator of worlds, and a person who can shape dreams. They can inspire people, and by doing so we can try to make the world a better place. It’s also a character that is profoundly linked to a personal hero of mine, Neil Gaiman.”</p>
<p id="jpIJCA">When players pull cards from a blind pack in <em>Altered</em>, they have the chance to pull either the common of the more rare versions of The Sandman. The rare version above, which retains its Lyra faction allegiance, costs one less to play from a player’s reserve <em>and</em> allows for a boost of two to be optionally placed on top of it. That makes it cheaper to play, <em>and</em> more powerful in the field. </p>

<p id="SsQadJ">Both versions of the card also allow a player to apply a status, called Asleep, to another Character on the table. According to one of the game’s designers, François Jourdain, the Asleep status can be used either defensively or offensively. The easiest way to use it would be to put an opponent’s character to sleep, removing them from the ensuing conflict and allowing you to make progress against your opponent. But you can also use it on <em>your own</em> characters: Asleep can prevent them from participating in a combat they are sure to lose, or players can proactively place characters asleep in order to bring them forward in following rounds more cheaply or alongside more powerful allies. It’s a debuff, a feint, and an attack strategy all in one.</p>
<p id="tEtEVP">A third, even more rare version of the card applies those same powers but to a different faction. This one, called <a href="https://www.altered.gg/our-world/factions/ordis">Ordis</a>, opens up even more and different strategic possibilities. Mimura was quick to add that other versions of The Sandman will likely surface in the future.</p>
<p id="E6xOhJ">“When you materialize a character from imagination,” Mimura said, “you can feed it with your own vision of what the character is. [...] So maybe in the future [...] he will have a completely different face, or maybe it will be women. We try to have all the options open to showcase a lot of diversity.” </p>

And then there’s you, more than likely still trying to get your <em>Elden Ring</em> sea legs back, trying to figure out where to go, until you wind up a little ways west of a burned down shanty town, through a nest of birds, headed down into a mausoleum where certain death is waiting with his best friend, his crossbow. As it turns out, though, the Blackgaol Knight is the only thing standing between you and some of the best bits of armor for your early travels. Guess you might as well kill him.

That’s generally his go-to whenever you’re out of stabbing range, but even when you’re in range, he’ll occasionally charge up his Greatsword and fire a devastating wave of energy, followed up by a deadly and delayed sweeping slash. Thankfully, aside from two moves that will absolutely disrespect your life bar, he’s your run-of-the-mill knight battle, taking random swipes at you with his Greatsword in one- or two-hander modes, occasionally going for a kamikaze flying attack when he’s feeling fancy. He’d be kind of a pushover if only all of his attacks didn’t hit like a ten-ton hammer.</p><h2 id="h116785"><a id=""></a><strong>Strategy: Defeating The Blackgaol Knight</strong></h2><p>So, fun twist, this is a boss fight where you can’t actually summon any Spirit Ashes. You are utterly on your own for this one. How delightful.</p><p>Anyway, once you enter the boss room, lock onto him, and run to the left or right, circling closer to the Knight while he fires his barrage of arrows. If you’re lucky, you’ll escape unscathed, but taking one or two arrows at the end of the barrage isn’t the end of the world. When he’s done firing, he’s open for a few seconds while he reloads. The Knight is particularly vulnerable to magic, so now’s your cue to fire at will, magic users, though, as usual, you’re better served keeping a safe distance. For melee builds, your openings are plentiful, but short. Pick a weapon with a nice balance of power and speed that you can cancel out of easily, but don’t get greedy.</p><p>Once you’re close enough, the Knight will get into melee mode with his Greatsword. While in one-handed mode (sword slung over one shoulder), his attacks are quick, but a nimble player can dodge around him pretty easily for backstabs, and it’s not hard for magic users to stay out of striking distance, as long as you don’t fire anything with too much charge time. For tanky players, if your poise is high enough with a decent Greatshield, the Knight’s one-handed attacks will bounce right off your shield, leaving him wide open to get slapped around for a hit or two. Eventually, he’ll roll out of harm’s way, and you do not want to be mid-swing when that happens. Again, don’t get greedy. His aerial attack is devastating, but leaves him wide open for a backstab if you dodge it right.</p><p>Two-handed mode is where things get more dangerous, though, as he’s prone to long combo strings that never end where you want them to, and do a serious number on your stamina if you try to block him with a shield. More than that, he’ll often break his combo by going directly into his wave attack. The wave is easily dodged; the follow-up attack is not, thanks to some odd timing, but it’s not impossible. The trick here is distance: staying far enough away to avoid his combos, but close enough to punish him when he stands still. The wind-up for his wave attack *seems* like a good time to lay the smackdown, and if you’re close enough to him, you might get lucky where it’s one of the times he doesn’t go for the follow-up swipe, but it’s still a dangerous risk. </p><p>Once you’ve done enough damage, he’ll pull a Flask of Crimson Tears. That’s annoying, but 1), he’s wide open when it happens, and 2), he can only do it once. Patience and persistence are the order of the day here.</p><p>Is it worth it, though? Is it worth it, though? Well, the rewards are the Solitude Armor Set, and the Greatsword of Solitude, all utterly invaluable in the early goings in the Realm of Shadow. So, yeah. Worth it. So, yeah. Worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems as though Sony is officially giving up on virtual reality (VR). According to a new report from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Central</a>, Sony has continued to make cuts to its PlayStation VR development since the release of PS VR2.</p>



<p>The outlet states that sources have told them that Sony is “making deep cuts to funding for VR games.” They continued to say that they were told that there will be “very few opportunities for VR game development at Sony going forward.”</p>



<p>“To back that up, another source informed me that only two PS VR 2 games are in development at Sony,” the report continued.</p>



<p>Sony launched the PS VR 2 in February 2023 for $549.99, a price higher than the PlayStation 5 console that’s required to utilize it. Since then, there have been varying reports of the state of the headset, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a complete pause on production</a> due to sales. One simple search on any forum or social media site shows fans frustrated about the lack of new games coming out for it. </p>



<p>Sony did recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce a new adapter launching in August</a> that will allow owners to use their PS VR2 headset with their PC. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on the report. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>

Amid some calls for the developer to make things easier or add different difficulty modes, however, Miyazaki has clarified why FromSoftware instead looks to continuously push players.</p><p>"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more, but that wasn’t the right approach," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>"Had we taken that approach, I don’t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy, which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p><p>Shadow of the Erdree, which arrives today, June 21, 2024, features bosses with which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-pushed-the-envelope-on-what-can-be-withstood-by-players-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">FromSoftware "really pushed the envelope" on what the player can withstand</a>, Miyazaki said ahead of its release. In fact, getting into the expansion even poses a challenge as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">players must defeat an optional boss</a>.</p><p>Those eager to explore every inch of the expansion can check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">IGN's extensive guide</a>, which covers <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">Shadow of the Erdtree's new weapons</a>, its various quest lines, and how to defeat those pesky new bosses.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said.
