The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646977/bungie-marathon-release-date-september-alpha-test-details">slick-looking shooter</a> from the makers of <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny</em> was originally set to release in September, but will now <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more">launch on March 5th</a>. Bungie will launch <em>Marathon </em>on Xbox Series S / X, PS5, and PC, priced at $39.99.</p><p>Bungie initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">delayed <em>Marathon</em> in June</a> last year following plenty of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">alpha test feedback</a>. The studio recently held playtests that included new features like proximity chat and an option to solo queue into games.</p><p><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, where players take on the role of a Runner to scavenge what’s left behind. As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. <em>Marathon</em> is a PvPvE environment, so players will be fighting creatures on planets as well as other players. If you die during a run, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up.</p><p>Bungie’s delay to Marathon means it is now launching months after <em>ARC Raiders</em>, an extraction shooter from the makers of <em>The Finals</em> that has consistently been in the top five most-played games on Steam since its launch in late October. Bungie had originally planned to launch <em>Marathon </em>ahead of <em>ARC Raiders</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As seen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-new-inkle-game-a-total-war-alternative-a-paper-mario-like-rpg-and-some-bladesongs">The Maw</a>, fluffy defence shooter Mochi-O is out today, and – judging from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596670/MOCHIO/">Steam demo</a> I’ve played – is an at least passingly entertaining MIRV explosion of gleeful nonsense. Landing somewhere between tower defence, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, and Tamagotchi, it has you holding up a genetically engineered hamster-like creature up to a window and blasting waves of attackers with the mounted weapons systems hidden in his fur. Then, setting him down and giving him a good long scritch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Keeping Mochi-O (also the name of your adopted battle rodent) happy, through the liberal application of petting and treats, serves two purposes. One, it keeps the beast sweet with your particular band of humans, his genocidal instincts being revealed through a mind-reading iPad. And two, it pre-emptively upgrades Mochi-O for the subsequent mission, sustained scratches yielding XP and currency boosts. Which is more than my cat ever gives to me.</p>
<p>The shooty bits operate on similar "Sure, why not" logic. Downed foes drop delicious seeds that Mochi-O can hoover up to unlock and improve his armaments, which escalate from one or two stick-out rifles to homing missile launcher, flung saw blades, and an orbital laser, the mechanics of which are not discussed beyond noting that the hamster can fire an orbital laser. And that’s just the demo – who knows what other war crimes the full game has tucked away in the floof.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Kodansha</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>More so than a classic shoot 'em up, the pick-and-mix upgrade system and general focus on waveclear call to mind a modern Survivorslike. Which is risky, as firing from a distance doesn’t allow quite as many of those squeaky-bum, narrow escape moments that the latter genre trades in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">often to thrilling effect</a>. And yet, Mochi-O does seem to have a good grasp on the simpler dopamine extraction techniques of a quality autoshooter. Heavy waves and upgraded arsenals combine for some amusingly exaggerated destruction scenes, and the casino ding-ding-ding of devouring a seed pile is as satisfying as any SFX I’ve heard in all nineteen days of 2026 so far.</p>
<p>Crucially, it also hard-commits to its silliness, offering its daft pet combat with a confidence that’s only attainable by enjoying a deep sense of peace with itself. I respect that, in people, and in kawaii gerbil missile defence simulators.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-is-my-favorite-limited-edition-ps5-dualsense-controller-yet-2000660992</link>
            <guid>1410175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buried in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em> launch info dump today</a>, which Bungie rushed out early after it was accidentally leaked over on Xbox, is the news that sci-fi shooter will arrive alongside the latest limited edition PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. And unlike many of the recent ones we’ve gotten, this one actually looks really good.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em>-inspired limited edition DualSense controller is $85 and goes up for pre-order on January 29 10:00 a.m. local time at direct.playstation.com. There’s also an accompanying Pulse Elite wireless headset that will go on sale at the same time, though for a much heftier price tag. That accessory will be $170. I’ve never loved the look of the Pulse headset and, frankly, the<em> Marathon</em> aesthetic isn’t changing that.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660998">Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>What I love most about the <em>Marathon</em> DualSense, other than the generally subtle design and clean look, is how neatly the typography and icons mesh with the underlying sensibility of the controller. In other words, its a very natural fit unlike some other recent limited edition DualSenses. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/20250508-ds/"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> one</a> wasn’t bad but felt pretty bland and I didn’t dig the giant bronze block over the touch pad. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> one</a>, meanwhile, looked like someone threw up gold dust on it.</p>

 <p>Bonus points to the <em>Marathon</em> controller for keeping the only branded text, the name of the game, hidden in neon on the underside of the controller. Is this controller even better looking than the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296678467989"><em>Concord</em> one</a>? I think so. Will it be as rare as that one? Probably! Hopefully, it’s not because<em> Marathon</em> ends up flopping as well.</p>

<p>From January 29, prospective fans of Marathon, Bungie’s all-new extraction shooter, can pre-order the limited edition DualSense and Pulse Elite wireless headset. The exclusive range is being manufactured to welcome Marathon to the market, and the announcement comes at the same time as the game’s release date was confirmed.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on March 5, but for now, you can stoke your excitement by <strong>preparing </strong>to preorder the limited edition controller and headset.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-s-marketing-march-starts-now">Marathon’s Marketing March Starts Now</h2>



<p>Bungie dropped a new trailer earlier today, revealing the full release date for Marathon, the upcoming extraction title. It came hours after the full trailer was leaked online, uncovering the game’s launch date before Bungie could drop the announcement.</p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed ahead of time was the new DualSense controller and Pulse Elite wireless headset, produced in honor of the new game.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky road for Marathon and Bungie over the last year or so, but by all accounts, things are starting to straighten up ahead of the game’s ultimate release.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the new controller:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And a nice glimpse at the new Pulse Elite wireless headset:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While you can pre-order the peripherals from January 29, you won’t get your hands on them until the game launches in March. Also, you can <strong>only </strong>pre-order the Pulse Elite wireless headset from PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>Here are your pricing points:</p>



<p><strong>DualSense –</strong> $84.99</p>



<p><strong>Pulse Elite</strong> <strong>– </strong>$169.99</p>



<p>Marathon could turn around all expectations and smash into the extraction space with a mighty roar in just a few weeks. People are approaching the game with bated breath, but recent playtests have suggested that it’s potentially shaping up to be something enjoyable, at the very least.</p>

<p>Heartopia will likely end 2026 as one of the most lovingly titled games, and the life-sim title established itself early on as a game to keep an eye on. Its popularity boomed very quickly, and if you PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo owners want in on the action, there are answers for you all.</p>



<p>You’d think you can only have so many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-forget-gta-6-2026-is-all-about-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> games like Heartopia. Yet, the game from developer XD is proving once again that humanity can’t get enough of building houses and completing menial tasks that would be more productive if done in the real world—but we’re all gamers here, it would be hypocritical to suggest you go touch grass.</p>



<p>If you have a Heartopia-shaped box on your mind, its console status should be of interest.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Heartopia On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pretty bubbles in the air. Credit to XD</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s an arrow through the heart for PS5 users as Heartopia isn’t available to play on PlayStation consoles at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Heartopia’s launch day player numbers on PC were fantastic, as were the ones after it! Before it came to Steam, Heartopia actually launched on the Google Play Store and the App Store. It garnered a reputation very first, making its Steam release a popular one. Tens of thousands of people got straight to work on creating homes and virtual lives.</p>



<p>For now, PlayStation 5 owners must miss out and play the waiting game. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Heartopia On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Heartopia is bypassing Xbox consoles, leaving Xbox Series X|S users to have their hearts skip a beat.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone is striking out with Heartopia. The life-sim title doesn’t have any love in its heart for Microsoft and Xbox owners right now. It follows the same sorrowful fate as PlayStation players, but let’s hope there’s a future where this can change.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-heartopia-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Heartopia On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners can also get in the same loveless boat, as Heartopia isn’t on a Nintendo console either.</strong></p>



<p>Per the Heartopia Discord Server, one of its main moderators (sweetkayla_xo) <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128257488375005215/1420319877507579988/1458417800250134569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No – Heartopia isn’t launching on consoles yet.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how much official information they have on the game. If they do know the inner-workings of the game’s development and reach, then this is a surefire sign that Heartopia is coming to consoles; we just don’t know when.</p>



<p>Are you playing Heartopia on mobile or PC? Do you have anything to say about the poor console players who are missing out? You can share your thoughts via the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Location Tease Points To Post-Apocalyptic China]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-location-post-apocalyptic-china/</link>
            <guid>1410166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Shift Up recently posted an image on social media revealing a ‘location scout’ for their ‘next title’, which is almost certainly Stellar Blade 2. The follow-up to the 2024 post-apocalyptic sultry slasher was confirmed a while back, and by now, it should be full steam ahead for Shift Up in terms of piecing it together.</p>



<p>The apocalyptic landscape shared by the team on social media is a snippet taken from Chongqing, China. This is a gargantuan, dense cityscape with a population of <span>over 32 million people, but in Stellar Blade 2, it appears&nbsp;<strong>as</strong></span><strong> a ghost city</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-promises-to-turn-heads">Stellar Blade 2 Promises to Turn Heads</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade dropped on PlayStation 5 in 2024, emerging as a game that intrigued players because, while it was marketed almost as a ‘gooner game’, it turned out to have some immensely satisfying combat mechanics and a decent story.</p>



<p>The game’s lead, Eve, wastes no time in showing as much flesh as possible, and that’s why the game perhaps didn’t get as serious a stamp of approval as it should have from some critics.</p>



<p>Regardless, it was a commercial success that was compounded by a hugely successful launch on PC a year later, and recently, the team at Shift Up revealed that <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">another game in the series</a> is coming</strong>.</p>



<p>The recent post <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/2012973553562321375">on social media</a> shows a crumbling, abandoned landscape, which eagle-eyed fans immediately identified as being a rendition of Chongqing, China. This was confirmed by Shift Up shortly after, giving fans the impression that, whenever Stellar Blade 2 arrives, it might take inspiration from or be directly set in and around the Chinese city.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s no big secret that Chinese fans were hugely approving of the game. It was estimated that 58% of PC-related sales of Stellar Blade were <strong>from </strong>China.</p>







<p>We know nothing about Stellar Blade 2, outside of these tiny tidbits from Shift Up. The nature of the game is yet to be revealed, but it might not be too long before <strong>it is</strong>. Fans expect something to be uncovered <strong>in the coming months</strong>.</p>

<h2>You can do better than that</h2>
<p>That’s a moderately useful option for cloud-curious Xbox players that might not be willing to take the plunge on a monthly subscription, we suppose. But it also feels like Microsoft could come up with some more imaginative ways to use Cloud Gaming to reach occasional players in new ways.</p>
<p>What’s stopping Microsoft from offer streaming players a 30-minute timed demo stream of <em>any</em> available Xbox Cloud Gaming title—perhaps in exchange for watching a short ad, or perhaps simply as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/01/xbox-live-arcade-portolio-planner-sounds-off-about-demos/">an Xbox Live Arcade-style sales juicing tactic</a>? Or why not offer discounted access to a streaming-only Game Pass subscription for players willing to watch occasional ads, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/netflix-rolls-out-its-basic-with-ads-plan-in-the-us-and-beyond/">like Netflix</a>? Microsoft could even let players spend a couple of bucks to rent a digital copy of the title for a few days, much as services like iTunes do for newer films.</p>
<p>Those are just a few ideas off the top of our heads. And they all feel potentially more impactful than using ads as a way to let Xbox players stream copies of games they already purchased.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/despite-revolutionary-promises-stadias-biz-model-is-pure-establishment/">noted</a> how Stadia’s strictly buy-before-you-play streaming business model limited the appeal of what ended up as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-stadia-officially-shuts-down-january-2023-will-refund-game-purchases/">a doomed cloud-gaming experiment</a>. Microsoft should take some lessons from Google’s failure and experiment with new ways to use streaming to reach players that might not have access to the latest high-end hardware for their gaming experiences.</p>

			<p>Although life continues to be grim for fans of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls</em></strong> series, as the wait for the sixth entry in the series gets more difficult to bear with each passing day, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025</strong> brought a smile to more than a few of them with the release of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>, a remake of the fourth entry in the series by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> powered by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 5</strong> which leaves the original gameplay almost intact.</p>



<p>Right from the outset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"><strong>the game's shadowdrop appeared successful</strong></a>, which wasn't surprising given how popular the game remained following its 2006 release. However, nostalgia is not as powerful as some may think for engagement, as many players got their fix in about 10 hours before dropping the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/how-2025s-xbox-published-games-sold"><strong>a new report</strong></a> shared a couple of days <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ago,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong>&nbsp;looked at how well&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox-published</strong>&nbsp;games performed</span> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong>, starting with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong>. The remake sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.1 million copies</strong> on the system, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"proving the pull of Bethesda’s legacy catalogue on PlayStation hardware,"</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Elliot</strong> wrote in the Substack post. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Over 80% of Oblivion’s PS5 copies were sold during its first month on the market, but some discounts to $33 over the past couple of months have led to small sales spikes,"</em> the analyst added.</p>



<p>While sales were solid, player engagement wasn't impressive at all for a massive RPG, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"around half of Oblivion Remastered players on PS5 played for less than 15 hours, showing that most people got their nostalgia fix before meaningfully progressing."</em> Considering how easy it is to lose oneself in Cyrondiil before making any real progress in the main story, this highlights that a remake needs more than improved visuals to keep players engaged past the point where they get their nostalgia fix.</p>



<p>However, there could be a few more reasons why those who purchased <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</strong> did not play for long, besides the lack of new content. For starters, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/">the game still runs poorly across all formats</a></strong>, and the performance hiccups make it challenging to enjoy the new visuals. In addition, the game does not support <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-8k-texture-packs/">mods</a></strong> on consoles, preventing it from achieving the same enduring popularity as its sequel, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skyrim</em></strong>.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> selling reasonably well, regardless of how long players have lost themselves in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyrodiil</strong>, it will be interesting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Starfield</em></strong> will fare on the system. While the latest <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RPG</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bethesda</strong> is far from being as popular as previous games from the studio, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot</strong> believes it will outperform the remake developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Virtuos</strong>. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-might-get-cyberpunk-2077-2-0-style-update-ps5-switch-2-launch-2026/"><strong>the rumored 2.0 update</strong></a> will also provide reasons for jaded players like me to return to the game, whose opinion on it<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/"><strong> soured a lot in the months after its release.</strong></a></p>

<p>That's March 5th, 2026, as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-leaked-via-xbox-community-page-march-5th-deluxe-edition-available.1409665/">leaked</a> a bit ahead of time via some Xboxer slightly shakily filming their telly. Thankfully, you can now watch the fresh trailer above in the quality intended.</p>
<p>It bwaaaas and shoots its way through some action, while a narrator called Gantry waxes lyrical about Tau Ceti being buried. The only way it can maybe be saved, it turns out, is via you running around and getting shot a lot, which is a happy coincidence. I'll be honest, I'm not quite sure how to feel about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> at this juncture, at least until I've given it a go.</p><p>I have long admired the game's commitment to the colour lime green, as if it's a twelve year old who thinks being sponsored by Monster Energy is akin to being knighted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>. Then again, Bungie betray this a bit by momentarily turning everything red towards the end of the trailer, as a tall robotic silhouette. However, this mysterious threat - who I assume to be the baddie - does have a glowing emerald circle in their chest, suggesting the heart of Marathon still flows with that love of lime green.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy, you can queue up to pre-order the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPwr3JClpuQ">collector's edition</a>, which comes with a vacuum-packed caterpillar thing among other tat. The base version, meanwhile, will set you back £34.99 / $39.99 / €39.99, while the deluxe edition that boasts extra in-game stuff but no physical goodies costs £44.99 / $59.99 / €59.99. All the details on what each version includes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3065800/view/114412015531853135">here</a>, where Bungie have also mentioned that details for an open preview weekend will be coming soon.</p>
<p>That post also runs down the cast of English voice actors, which includes Deus Exman Elias Toufexis, Arthur Morgman Roger Clark, and at least four <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> threeple - Samantha Béart, Jennifer English, Neil Newbon, and Tracy Wiles. Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSfKBTKmTKI">also in it</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The modder behind a paywalled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> VR mod has accused CD Projekt RED of following “in Take-Two Interactive Software’s steps,” after its legal team issued their project with a DMCA takedown notice. Clearly undeterred, the same modder has even gone ahead and released a VR mod for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>. It uses the same paywalled method of distribution that got them into trouble with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</span></p> <p><span>Luke Ross (not his real name, according to </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>) is a somewhat infamous figure within the VR modding community. His “R.E.A.L. VR” project is a singular mod that supports dozens of high-profile video games, including </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The catch is that the R.E.A.L. VR mod requires a $10 monthly subscription to download directly through Luke Ross’ Patreon. While you could easily download everything you need with a one-off payment, you’d need to renew your subscription if one of the games is updated. If you’re curious as to how much Luke Ross is making off of said subscription, </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> estimated that he was earning roughly $20,000 per month back in 2022.</span></p>

  <p><span>Requiring payment for a mod is obviously against most publishers’ terms of service, which is why Ross’ R.E.A.L. VR project has previously been subject to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-v-take-two-mafia-modder-mods-luke-ross-vr-dmca-1849149715">DMCA takedown by Take-Two Interactive</a> for its </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption II </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V</span></i><span> support.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on a lengthy rant in the “About” section of his Patreon page in which he admonishes Take-Two for their “hostile behavior toward modders and gamers alike,” the VR modder doesn’t make much of a distinction between himself and those who release their mods for free.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771"><span>A new post</span></a><span> on his Patreon now projects that same ire at CD Projekt Red.&nbsp; It blasts the Polish RPG-maker for its “iron-clad corpo logic” over the fact that “</span><span>every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free.” </span><span>“As usual they stretch the concept of ‘derivative work’ until it’s paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property,” Ross writes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This post went up on January 17. Since then, R.E.A.L. VR has been updated to include support for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast’s parent company, has been quite liberal with its use of DMCA takedowns in the past, so I wouldn’t expect R.E.A.L. VR’s </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span> support to stick around for long.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR into a modding live service</h2> <p><span>If I were to play devil’s advocate for a second, I do think there’s something to Luke Ross’ rants. R.E.A.L. VR is obviously not on the same level as your average mod, and likely requires a lot of upkeep. It’s hard to see a way in which he could continue to support it without some sort of monetary incentive.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other hand, there’s a very straightforward loophole here that Ross is doubtlessly aware of and that hundreds of other modders take advantage of: donations. Instead of charging a one-off payment or a subscription for a mod, others release all of their mods for free and allow appreciative users to donate to them instead. There’s less danger with this method since donating is completely optional. </span></p> <p><span>Plenty of mod users don’t like mod paywalls either. A popular mod adding DLSS upscaling support to Starfield back at launch sparked its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlss3-fsr2-pc-mod-nvidia-amd-intel-piracy-1850804328"><span>own controversy</span></a><span> when it was put behind a similar monthly subscription paywall. It seems the community is wise to Ross’ strategy, however, with many commenters over on the virtual reality subreddit taking CDPR’s side.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“This is not the first mod the Modder had taken down because he tried to make a Live Service out of it,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o03xc9q/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>Frraksurred</span></a><span>. “He knew he was outside the ToS and just chose to get away with it as long as he could. Now he’s trying to play the victim.” Others agreed. </span><span>“Good,” wrote user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qfd6z2/comment/o04zlti/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>PelluxNetwork</span></a><span>. “Paywalled mods are disgusting. Take donations, no worries there, but pay-walling your copyright infringement should be an obvious no.” </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot MMO Secures World of Warcraft Lead Producer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-mmo-secures-world-of-warcraft-lead-producer/</link>
            <guid>1410130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>World of Warcraft’s former lead producer has confirmed that they are jumping ship to work on Riot’s upcoming MMO. </p>



<p>Not much is known about the upcoming Riot League of Legends MMO, other than the fact that it is set in the Runeterra universe. League of Legends itself is reportedly scheduled to receive a major overhaul by 2027, which will seemingly be dubbed as ‘League Next’. However, today we aren’t talking about that title. </p>







<h2 id="h-riot-mmo-brings-in-world-of-warcraft-s-raymond-bartos">Riot MMO Brings in World of Warcraft’s Raymond Bartos </h2>



<p>The World of Warcraft’s lead producer, Raymond Bartos, announced his departure from Blizzard last month, after working for 3 years at the company. During that time, Bartos helped push content like Plunderstorm, multiple Remixes, Gear update, Dungeon Followers, Dastardly Duos and more. However, now he is ready to kick-start a new chapter in his game development journey. </p>



<p>Bartos took to <a href="https://x.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to reveal that he will be moving to Riot Games to work on their upcoming MMO and taking on the role of Senior Game Producer. After working on one of the biggest MMORPGs on the planet, his expertise will be crucial to developing this project. The values of Riot Games were influential in securing Bartos, with the former WoW lead producer revealing that “kindness, respect, and care aren’t just words” at Riot, and it is something the “team truly lives by”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m incredibly excited to be joining <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@riotgames</a> on the MMO team!!!</p><p>From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values—and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious… <a href="https://t.co/Sap1O7CQeo">pic.twitter.com/Sap1O7CQeo</a></p></div>— GoodGuyRay 💙 (@RaymondBartos) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaymondBartos/status/2011629347803734299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Regarding Riot’s MMO, the last major update was <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1770479141600874553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">back in 2024</a>, when the company’s co-founder spoke about future plans. At the time, they had decided to reset the direction of the project. Resetting also meant that they would be “going dark” for “several years,” and that seems to be the case. The company doesn’t want to create an MMO that players have played before with a Runeterra coat of paint. Instead, they want to do something “that truly feels like a significant evolution of the genre.” </p>







<p>In other news, Riot Games has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-congratulates-hytale-six-months-after-canceling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congratulated Hytale’s early access launch</a>, six months after cancelling the game.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

                <p>After years out of the Hollywood spotlight, The Mummy and The Whale actor Brendan Fraser has made a huge comeback. The actor has new film roles lined up, but right now, his most pressing concern is avoiding getting steamrolled by the notorious Lynel mini-bosses in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><p>In an interview, Fraser was asked whether he was playing any video games, and he explained that he was "still stuck" on the critically acclaimed 2017 Zelda game. "I want to know how to get better weapons without getting my ass kicked by all the Lynels," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign/video/7596135484670184717" rel="nofollow ">Fraser said to IGN</a>, while also lamenting that there simply aren't enough bomb-flowers in the game. While his interviewer suggested he consult online guides, Fraser responded that he was looking to beat the game the old-fashioned way, without relying on walkthroughs.</p>

                <p>Bungie's long in development extraction shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, will launch on March 5, a new gameplay trailer has revealed ahead of preorders opening. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC and cost $40.</p><p>The trailer introduces players again to Tau Ceti IV, a colony that you, playing as runners, will infiltrate to dispatch armed forces and extract with valuable gear. You'll make use of a variety of Runner Shells that give you different abilities and perks, defining your role in a party or giving you a choice over how to build if you're planning to play solo. The art style remains as striking as ever, with Bungie's signature gunplay being showcased in the action below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhSVj6WZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marathon was initially scheduled to launch on September 23, 2025 before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">indefinitely delayed</a> following a series of public tests that drew criticisms over the game's mechanics. Bungie noted key areas that it planned to improve with more development time, namely the game's survival elements, its lore and world building, and better social experiences for solo and duos players.</p><p>Sony, who will publish Marathon, assured fans that the game would release before the end of March 2026, with Bungie also confirming that a public beta will take place later in February ahead of launch. Development of Marathon has been rife with controversy, with Bungie eventually settling matters with an artist that accused it of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">stealing assets for the shooter </a>without permission.</p><p>Since its delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has taken the extraction shooter genre by storm, amassing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">hundreds of thousands of concurrent players</a> and sustaining that in the months since release.</p>

If you're so inclined, pre-orders for the game are open now as well, and you'll get extra stuff if you buy the game before its release date hits, including some rewards for <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>This announcement marks the second time that <em>Marathon</em>'s release date has been revealed; back in April last year, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="aa33e300-ad1e-49d4-aa79-c1a1ab82252d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set a September date for the game</a>, but <em>Marathon </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b9bec301-96aa-432b-879e-d90acf44097c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a> in June following lukewarm feedback from the game's alpha testing period.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the disappointing alpha feedback, Bungie also found itself at the center of controversy in May, when it was revealed that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bd258c2-70a9-4816-a5f2-9f981d275fcc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">artwork that had been stolen</a> from an online artist without proper credit.</p><p>All of that followed on from news in August 2024 that <em>Marathon</em>'s former director Chris Barrett had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ef2a90f-6d8c-4535-a8a5-2e5217b15752" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">fired over misconduct allegations</a>, which led him to sue Sony over his dismissal. Sony promptly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d697b644-87cf-46b1-9530-25c17167ff69" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">responded to the lawsuit</a>, providing evidence of what it called a "pattern of misconduct" on Barrett's part.</p><p>This is all to say that <em>Marathon </em>has had a lengthy and difficult development cycle, and with <em>Destiny 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-q2-2025-26-destiny-2-bungie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b988b438-f974-4d01-854a-83f6fa549891" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">proving a disappointment to Bungie and Sony</a> in recent years, the two will likely be hoping this one is more of an unqualified success.</p><p>You can check out the new pre-order trailer for <em>Marathon</em>, which also introduces a brand new character you'll be meeting a lot in the game, right here.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are no further delays, you'll be able to check out <em>Marathon </em>on March 5th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Code Veronica originally launched in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast, and while not a mainline numbered entry like Resident Evil 2, 3 or 4, it remains beloved by fans and considered a core part of the franchise's story. Its narrative takes place around the same time as Resident Evil 3, but instead features Claire and Chris Redfield on a remote prison island and then in Antarctica. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Resident Evil 5, speculation around a remake has bubbled up following a teasing comment by Eva La Dare, the voice actress behind that game's character Sheva Alomar. However, as of yet, Capcom is not believed to have greenlit any new version of the game — which garnered strong sales and a mostly positive reaction from fans back at its original launch in 2009. Whatever Alomar is referring to, it's likely not worth getting your hopes up.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Capcom will reportedly finish remaking its early Resident Evil entries with a fresh version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a>, due in 2028 after this year's Requiem and next year's new version of Code Veronica. (And after all that? Well, it would seem time for an all-new Resident Evil entry once again.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, Capcom's under-wraps Resident Evil Zero remake appeared to pop up on the resume of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy video game actor Jon McLaren, with the suggestion that he will now be playing escaped convict Billy Coen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before all of that, of course, Resident Evil Requiem will arrive on February 27. Set to feature new character Grace Ashcroft and returning hero Leon S. Kennedy, the game's mix of survival horror and action looks hugely promising — even if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">we're all a bit concerned by that nasty-looking bite on Leon's neck</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> introduced an upgrade to its hero proficiency system last week, allowing players to earn new rewards. Many of these rewards--including the brag-worthy Lord icons--require a considerable amount of grinding to achieve, which has led to the rise of "Lord farming" amongst the playerbase.</p><p>Essentially, players aren't moving after they spawn into a match, as they spam their abilities to earn proficiency points safely. This has led to some <em>very </em>one-sided matches, and developer NetEase says it'll address this problem in a future update. There's no date yet for when this update will go live, but players can expect some severe penalties if they're caught farming stats this way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Deadpool Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer | The Merc with a Mouth</p>
      </div>
<p>"Recently, we've noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points," <a href="https://x.com/marvelrivals/status/2013176993383133552" rel="nofollow ">NetEase wrote online</a>. "This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players. To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans. We ask all players to help us maintain a fair and healthy game environment."</p><p>Outside of players suddenly developing concrete feet, Marvel Rivals has expanded with several new modes and heroes over the last couple of months. Rogue and Gambit made their grand debut the previous year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-deadpool-can-literally-do-it-all/1100-6537365/">and Deadpool was added to the game</a> when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-6-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-7412/">Season 6</a> began on January 16. Designed to be a Jack-of-all-trades character, Deadpool can serve as a Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist hero, and he can upgrade his abilities throughout a match.</p><p>Season 6 also added team-up balance changes, the Collector's museum, a dueling arena, and a photo mode. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-shortening-seasons-releasing-a-new-hero-every-month/1100-6530612/">The next Marvel Rivals hero</a> will be the monster-hunter Elsa Bloodstone, who'll arrive halfway through the current season.</p>

                <p>Valve has made changes to its AI-disclosure guidelines, removing the need for studios to disclose whether or not games have been developed with AI-powered tools and putting more emphasis on AI-generated assets.</p><p>The change, which was pointed out by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Simon Carless on LinkedIn</a>, suggests that Valve is no longer concerned by the use of AI tools that assist development, stating, "Efficiency gains through the use of [AI-powered dev tools] is not the focus of this section." These tools could included a variety of things, such as AI-generated transcripts of meetings to code helpers that have become prevalent in most programming environments.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>Valve states the the aim of its disclosure policy is to inform players when AI is used to generate content, from marketing and conceptual assets to in-game ones that players will interact with. Developers are able to specify what assets have been generated and indicate, via a single checkbox, whether or not players will interact with AI-generated content during gameplay, be it images, audio, or other content.</p><p>This is the first time Valve has made a significant change to the AI disclosure rules since its introduction in 2024, when generative AI use in game development began rising. While there are thousands of games on Steam that disclose the use of AI, the policy is still voluntary and not enforce by moderation on Valve's end, meaning many developers might omit the disclosure on their store pages. The policy itself contradicts other rival storefronts such as the Epic Games Store, with Epic CEO Tim Sweeny recently stating that such disclosures "make no sense" for storefronts.</p><p>The use of AI continues to be a talking point off the back of 2025. The use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">AI-generated audio </a>in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> was widely discussed in the wake of its critical and commercial success, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios came under fire after its CEO suggested that the studio will make use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">generative AI in several conceptual phases</a> for its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a>.

Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition, and Far Cry Primal will receive the same update this week.</p><p>The news was first announced via a <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/2012162929614029088">cryptic X post</a> featuring three math equations using emojis to spell out the games and the 60 FPS update. These updates will be available this Wednesday, January 21, and apply when playing the games on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Individual trailers showcase the improved framerates (at least for Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon), which, keep in mind, is the primary upgrade; don’t expect any graphical enhancements. Still, it’s nice to have smoother-running versions of these games on current platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLmdp8xEHTU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLmdp8xEHTU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>To reiterate, the update applies to the Classic Editions of Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, which are remastered ports released for PS4 and Xbox One in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Far Cry Primal, meanwhile, is a native last-gen title released in 2016.</p><p>As you wait for the update to hit this Wednesday, you can read our original reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_3/b/pc/archive/2012/11/21/you-know-where-you-are-you-re-in-the-jungle-baby.aspx">Far Cry 3</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_3_blood_dragon/b/xbox360/archive/2013/04/30/ubisoft-loves-the-39-80s.aspx">Blood Dragon</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_primal/b/xboxone/archive/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review-moving-forward-by-looking-back.aspx">Primal</a>.

			<p>MIO: Memories In Orbit can be described in four words: beautiful, engaging, challenging, and frustrating. It is a game that will be those who really like a tough as nails platforming and boss fights, but it will frustrate those who do not like getting stuck on sections because your reaction times come up short. I fall somewhere in the middle of the two camps, with the game’s story taking me nearly 50 hours to complete, and there are still some sections of The Vessel I have yet to see.</p>
<p><iframe title="MIO: Memories in Orbit - Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OlFwMM1RdI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MIO: Memories of Orbit is set on a ship called The Vessel, a generational ship that was taking humans, called The Travellers by the robots of the ship, on a journey to find a new home. Some kind of disaster sees all of the Travellers disappear, leaving The Vessel to sail onward while it deteriorates. MIO finds that The Vessel is on its last legs because the Pearls – the different AIs that kept the ship going – have seemingly abandoned their duties which in turn has allowed some kind of corruption spread amongst some of the robots on the ship. MIO goes on a journey to discover what has happened to the Pearls, having to navigate a ship falling apart and rogue robots attacking anything in sight.</p>



<p>The Vessel is huge. MIO: Memories In Orbit’s map has such a variety of locations with each having their own distinct looks. You start in Nexus at its centre and from there you can explore the garden and promenade of the Haven, or head in the other direction to the Metropolis. Eventually, you will also be able to delve deeper into The Vessel towards the Vaults or head upward to the Celestial Bay. The only issue is that none of these locations are easily accessible through the deteriorating ship structure, and the platforming is far from forgiving.</p>

<p>MIO slowly gains new ways to traverse the ship, so you will need to go back and forth a fair few times between districts to see all of the platforming puzzles and bosses they have hidden within them. The platforming in MIO: Memories of Orbit does require precision and quick reflexes, with these sections getting more difficult as you unlock more traversal options. That’s because you will need to quickly switch between using each one to get to new locations, while also managing MIO’s energy bar. While most of the platforming is tough but fair, &nbsp;there were a few that felt way too tricky. There is a fine line between making something challenging and making something tedious or overly contrived, forcing you to repeat the same section over and over again. These moments always took away from the experience.</p>

<p>Combat in MIO: Memories of Orbit seems like a simple affair at first, with just a single attack button and a dodge, but there is a lot of depth around that. You have to understand and learn the patterns of your opponents, and while fights against regular enemies become easier as you get stronger, but each boss has its own unique attacks and arenas with their own hazards to deal with too. The battles are incredibly tough but, unlike some the platforming, they do not get to a point where they become too frustrating. It all comes down to knowing when to hit and knowing when to back off and move out the way for all of them. I liked each design of the bosses with each one having memorable hooks to them, with some appearing out of nowhere as you move through The Vessel.</p>
<p>Helping you get stronger are the Modifiers you can install, some of which allow for combos where the final hit deals additional damage, and others can increase the number of slots so you can equip more. However, there is a cost with increasing modifier slots, which could see Nacre Basins remaining empty. These are stopping points that allow you to replenish your health, which is useful especially before tough platforming sections and bosses, while nacre also acts as the game currency to buy upgrades for MIO.</p>

<p>MIO: Memories In Orbit is certainly going to compete to be one of the best-looking games of the year, with hand drawn environments and movements. Every district in The Vessel has such a unique look, with my personal favourite being the Aviaries and the Bell Tower. The designs of the characters look great and even though some characters don’t have faces the way they are drawn and posed communicate their emotions very well. The visual design is one of the main factors that kept me pushing through the game, because I wanted to see what the designers had come up with. This is paired well with the music and soundtrack, with haunting melodies in some areas really selling that this is a ship on its final voyage.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>

<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161509/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Team Cherry set a new genre standard with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>. That legacy has recently been reaffirmed by the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, a release that developers and publishers alike are now clamouring to match. These are beautifully animated combat platformers, built around tight controls and striking art direction. Players explore compelling, labyrinthine spaces in search of answers, upgrades, and increasingly brutal challenges.</p>
<p>Douze Dixiemes looks to emulate that success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>. The French indie studio's game is sumptuously designed, dripping with atmosphere and built around a compelling central mystery. There is a lot in this complex science fiction fable that feels a little too familiar. Even so, the little robot hero, MIO, is a strong candidate to carry the gauntlet thrown down by The Knight and Hornet.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161507/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Awakening on what looks like an operating table as a giant creature skitters away, MIO wanders out into the Vessel. This gigantic collection of biomes is filled with deadly flora and automatons, both hostile and friendly. Picking away at the mystery behind the Vessel’s collapse, she is tasked with finding and reactivating the Pearls, guardian AIs of this strange place.</p>
<p>MIO plays out like a very typical Metroidvania, with MIO (the game’s name matching the protagonist’s may get confusing) exploring areas of the Vessel and gaining abilities that allow her to push further.</p>
<p>The Vessel itself is a gorgeous place to inhabit. Grand architecture is fused with technology and pastel-coloured vegetation. Bio-organic masses weave in and out of stone constructs and metal pipes, while creatures stir in the shadows. Those shadows, and the lights that spread across surfaces, look like charcoal sketches. Each biome is distinct, and discovering a new area frequently inspires awe.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161508/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gorgeous sound design complements the painterly visuals. The enchanting synth score ebbs and flows, transitioning into frantic techno beats during moments of action. The dreamlike background themes emphasise the intimidating size of the Vessel, reinforcing just how small you feel within its vast interior.</p>
<p>Despite the grandeur, the overall tone is one of melancholy. Scattered around the Vessel are robots that pine for their loved ones and lament the downfall of this once thriving home. Helping them will slowly uncover the story behind this world and MIO’s purpose.</p>
<p>Not all the bots wandering around the Vessel are nice, however, and there is some nicely twitchy combat to enjoy alongside the exploration. Enemy types are varied, although the roster leans a bit too heavily toward aerial threats.</p>
<p>MIO has some basic slashing combos that combine with her floaty jump, letting her attack bots from all angles. A dodge is unlocked early on that adds to combat variety. Bosses escalate nicely. Some are punishing, but runbacks are merciful.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161512/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those runbacks, as well as general traversal, require skill and timing to navigate the many hazard-strewn routes of the Vessel. MIO can double jump from the beginning, which gets her through the opening areas with relative ease. Later, she obtains a grapple (here called the hairpin) that allows her to latch onto anchor points and enemies to gain height and reach more of the environment.</p>
<p>When she unlocks the ability to refresh her jump and hairpin, things get a bit more fiddly. Team Cherry veterans can attest that there is nothing more frustrating than whiffing a hit and breaking a long jump chain.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, this kind of platforming is a staple of the genre now. It can be deeply satisfying to master, but rage-inducing when you just can't get the hang of it. That said, there is an undeniable satisfaction in clearing hazard-filled vertical climbs and being gifted a merciful shortcut back to a hub area or boss encounter.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside a forgiving map structure, MIO’s combat and survival abilities are bolstered by mods. This gameplay-altering upgrade system is not unlike the chip abilities found in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>. Every aspect of her offence and defence can be buffed by installing mods scattered throughout the Vessel.</p>
<p>These modifications can tweak core elements of the experience. One even strips away the UI entirely, offering a cleaner view of the game’s lovely environmental design. Others focus on more direct boosts to offence and defence. The most powerful upgrades often come with a debuff attached, helping balance out the boon without undercutting its usefulness. Much like with Nier, mods are limited by capacity, so there is a nice juggling act at play. You will be building different versions of MIO to get past specific challenges.</p>
<p>There’s been an emphasis on other titles here, which may have distracted from judging the game on its own merits, but the comparisons are very hard to avoid. Ultimately, MIO wears its influences proudly, and it delivers enough atmosphere and polish to stand on its own. Its ideas and execution do lack originality, but that is not a dealbreaker.</p>
<figure><a title="MIO: Memories in Orbit Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161504/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a Switch 2 title, it ran smooth as butter both docked and undocked, never dipping below 60fps on the larger display. Consistent performance is crucial given how much precision the boss fights and platforming demand. The experience is rounded out nicely by assist options and difficulty tweaks that restore some of MIO’s health when she’s stationary and weaken bosses after each attempt. These options don’t dilute the overall experience, instead offering a more accessible entry point for players who found the game’s contemporaries a bit too unforgiving.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>MIO is a compelling adventure with solid platforming and combat. The Vessel is a great place to explore and the mod system adds versatility. A great Metroidvania, then, though its similarities to genre heavyweights stop it from being essential. If you are in the mood for another tightly designed Metroidvania on Switch, however, this is an easy recommendation.</p></section>

			<p>Over the past few years, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> has done an excellent job keeping the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em></strong> series in the spotlight by releasing remakes of the first four entries in the series alongside new entries in the series, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-survival-horror-king/">Resident Evil VII Biohazard</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a></em></strong>. This approach not only provided fans of the series with multiple entries to enjoy, but also revitalized it, which had looked like it was losing what made it so special with the widely criticized sixth entry.</p>



<p>2026 looks set to be an excellent year for fans of the series. In a little over a month, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></em></strong> will launch on <strong>PC</strong> and consoles, marking the return of <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> to a mainline entry in the series and a dual gameplay style that looks incredibly compelling.</p>



<p>The launch of the ninth main entry in the series, however, isn't everything fans reportedly have to look forward to despite the disappointing lack of news of this month's <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-resident-evil-showcase-capcom/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></em></strong>, as another <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> remake will be announced in the coming months, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>Addressing community speculation fueled by a social media post made by <strong>Eva La Dare</strong>, the voice actress of <strong>Sheva</strong>, protagonist of the fifth entry in the series together with <strong>Chris Redfield</strong>, who teased something for the series' <strong>30th anniversary</strong> this <strong>March</strong>, known series <strong><a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insider Dusk Golem reported</a></strong> that <em>"there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year."</em></p>



<p><em>"Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you,"</em> the insider continued. While a remake of the survival horror game, which made its debut on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">SEGA Dreamcast</strong> in early <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2000</strong> has been<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-zero-code-veronica-remakes/"> rumored to be in the works for a while</a></strong>, this is the first time we heard that it could be revealed ahead of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Zero</em></strong> remake, which has also been rumored to be in the works for a while.</p>



<p>While we have to take what Dusk Golem revealed with a grain of salt, the insider has proven quite reliable with both older and more recent Resident Evil series rumors. Last year, the insider revealed that Leon would be the second Resident Evil Requiem protagonist, ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/"><strong>confirmation during this year's <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</em> show.</strong></a></p>



<p>Following the release of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 4</em></strong> remake, which improved the original without revolutionizing the original formula which aged quite well, it will be exciting to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CAPCOM</strong> will modernize <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Code Veronica</em></strong> in its remake.</p>



<p>The original's formula is based into the series' roots, and has quite a few divisive narrative and gameplay choices, including the infamous <strong>Fire Extinguisher trap</strong> which may prevent players from obtaining a powerful weapon, sudden character swaps between <strong>Chris</strong> and <strong>Claire</strong>, excessive backtracing and some harsh difficulty spikes which would definitely need to be addressed to keep the series momentum going strong as it has in the past few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digixart, the studio behind <em>Road 96</em>, has announced that its upcoming adventure game <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> has been delayed until April in order to afford the studio some extra development time.</p><p>Announcing the news in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2678080/view/493840283288472148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, Digixart says it wants to "take a little extra time before launch" alongside publisher THQ Nordic, suggesting (with tongue firmly in cheek) that the delay caused them to consider renaming the game to <em>Tides of the Day After Tomorrow</em>.</p><p>The studio doesn't provide any more in-depth reason for the delay than that, but it's likely that, just like other game delays, things aren't quite where they need to be with <em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>right now, hence the need for some extra time to polish and finish off the game.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow </em>won't make its February release date.</figcaption>

<p>The delay won't affect <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s playable demo, however, so it's unlikely that anything will be significantly changing in terms of direction between now and the new release date of April 22nd.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, it's the next game from Digixart, the studio responsible for road trip adventure <em>Road 96</em>, which our very own Will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/road-96-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24ceeade-3c31-41f5-9bd2-d997ce525392" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">wasn't too impressed with</a> when it launched back in 2021.</p><p>This time around, Digixart has opted for an adventure that takes place in a world devastated by an event known as the Great Flood. You'll need to explore that world and deal with its denizens in order to combat a "deadly plastification" that threatens to end the world as you know it.</p><p><em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>'s unique gimmick is the ability to follow your friends (and, apparently, your favorite streamers) on their own adventures throughout the world of Elynd, watching what they do and having your story shaped by their actions.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Marathon Story Trailer Leaks Final Release Date Early]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975</link>
            <guid>1410052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tau Ceti IV is sick and the only cure is stylish PvEvP extraction gunplay. That’s the vibe of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">new <em>Marathon</em> trailer</a> that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2013110010272682070">leaked on Xbox</a> ahead of schedule. While Sony plays whack-a-mole to get the new footage taken down, screenshots from it showing a March 5, 2026 release date have already spread across the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://streamable.com/ahh4d3">The new story trailer</a> includes a fresh sizzle reel of previously unseen gameplay showing off the sci-fi multiplayer shooter’s various maps, runners, and guns. There’s a healthy dose of the Bungie project’s exceptional art peppered throughout. But of most interest to casual players will be the nod to an early March launch date.</p>

  <p>Following its 2025 delay, the game only resurfaced with a vague March release window. This appears to confirm it’s coming at the early end of that range, giving Sony’s latest live-service game a few weeks to prove itself before the end of the fiscal year. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/19/yes-the-leaked-marathon-preorder-and-release-date-is-real/">Paul Tassi at <em>Forbes</em></a>, the new trailer and final release date are accurate, with Bungie planning the official announcement to go live this week.</p>

 <p>There’s been some speculation among fans that Bungie will hold at least one round of open beta player tests before the game launches. If that’s the case, it now seems like a good bet we can expect those before the end of February. If so, it’ll be the last chance for people to go hands-on with the overhauled shooter for free before it arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">behind a $40 price point</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>Update: 1/29/2025, 11:04 a.m. ET:</strong> Bungie has gone ahead and released <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marathonthegame.bungie.net/post/3mcrz6dqutv25">the official trailer</a> and confirmed the game’s expansive voice cast:</p> <blockquote><p>Krizia Bajos, Samantha Béart, Beau Bridgland, Ry Chase, Roger Clark, Darin De Paul, Jennifer English, Dave Fennoy, Nika Futterman, Morla Gorrondona, Reina Guthrie, Donnla Hughes, Keston John, Sohm Kapila, Rich Keeble, Elliot Knight, Erica Lindbeck, Piotr Michael, Brent Mukai, Neil Newbon, Ariana Nicole George, Emily O’Brien, Lee Shorten, Jason Spisak, Ben Starr, JB Tadena, Fred Tatasciore, Craig Lee Thomas, Elias Toufexis, Oliver Vaquer, Scott Whyte, Tracy Wiles, Erin Yvette</p></blockquote> <p>Pre-order pages are also up early for the standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s Edition pages.

            <title><![CDATA[Play These 9 Open-World & RPG Games Releasing In 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-open-world-rpg-games-releasing-2026/</link>
            <guid>1410049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playing a new RPG or open-world game in 2026 could prove to be a big time commitment, but it’s probably worth it, so who cares? 2026 is serving up even more long-form gaming through new role-playing titles and open-world sandboxes, but no one wants a time sink, which is why Insider Gaming has singled out the best in the genres announced so far.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of crossover with open-world games and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-rpg-game-of-the-year-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> games. Similarities include open (or at least semi) environments, quests, leveling up, exploration, and fighting. It’s a style of gameplay that doesn’t get old, especially for those special few who make everything feel new.</p>



<p>2026 is shaping up to be an epic year of gaming, and these prospective releases will help.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-open-world-amp-rpg-titles-coming-in-2026">Best Open-World &amp; RPG Titles Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>Everything on this list has been outed for 2026. It doesn’t mean all games will release in 2026, as that’s just how the media industry works. Delays are common, and one VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb. Read the list as though every game is releasing, there are no issues, and you can carry on about your day like everything is perfect.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will be the first to cover any video game delays if they happen.</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-demo-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> isn’t completely open-world, it retains its usual RPG elements from its level-up system to picking certain stats to upgrade, along with quests, bosses, and the usual slew of RPG requirements. Team Ninja has also made Nioh 3 the most open in the franchise’s history, meaning the game’s devilish difficulty will be accompanied by a new sense of freedom not yet seen. It’s great to see Nioh back, and let’s hope you don’t want to see the back of it for being so tough it hurts.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: February 6.</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was aptly one of the wildest stories of 2025. Capcom’s long-running series broke an outrageous amount of new ground and catapulted the MH name into the upper echelons of mainstream gaming. 2026 cranks things down slightly with the release of Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. It brings back the less-heralded series, but with MH being as popular as ever, there might not be a better time to jump into a new Monster Hunter RPG.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 13.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pearl Abyss is back with Crimson Desert. The open-world title is a spiritual successor to Black Desert Online and will have you running and riding across the pristine lands of Pywel. Unlike its predecessor, Crimson Desert is a single-player-driven experience, focusing on your adventure with Kliff&nbsp;and his allies. It wouldn’t be a shock to see Crimson Desert in RPG GOTY conversations come the end of 2026, hence IG’s recommendation.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: March 19.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>KA-POW. Stop the count, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is winning it all! It’s probably not the case, but DC fans can dream as The Dark Knight readies himself for another dark night in the dank, dangerous streets of Gotham. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight isn’t your conventional LEGO title, and it might be all the better for it. Resembling a Rocksteady Arkham game more than a LEGO clone, there’s promise for Legacy of the Dark Knight, and it doesn’t look like a Joker.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: May 29.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new Fable has grown beyond being just a fable; it should finally be a 2026 reality. Playground Games is a connoisseur of high-speed racing that looks to send you speeding across the horizon (pun fully intended), but the talented team has broadened its horizons (ok, might be overkill) by being tasked with a new Fable. It’s been 16 years since Fable 3, and the time for waiting needs to be over. It’s a central figure in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, and a release this year should happen.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chrono-odyssey">Chrono Odyssey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Chrono Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>A “late-2026” release window is on the cards for Chrono Odyssey, so this one could be borderline. However, what is certain is that Chrono Odyssey looks otherworldly, and the MMORPG’s open world could be addicting, it’s <em>that </em>type of game. It’s been in beta, so it’s not like it’s a new entity suddenly dropping out of thin air, and Chrono Odyssey could explode overnight—unless you’re onto it now thanks to this list, eh?</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred">Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a lot of hatred in Diablo 4, isn’t there? After 2024’s Vessel of Hatred comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lord of Hatred</a> in 2026. It was announced at The Game Awards 2025, and the fan-favorite Paladin class is making a heroic return. Diablo 4 players will have Mephisto locked into their sights when the ARPG’s new content drops in April. D4’s endgame is getting overhauled, and there will be plenty of new features to look forward to.</p>



<p><strong>Current release date: April 28, 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Unknown Worlds Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s safe to say that Subnautica 2 hasn’t been able to swim away from its controversy. The unbelievable hype has been washed away somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-says-it-wasnt-because-of-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 delay</a>, followed by the ongoing lawsuit between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds and former leadership</a>. On the other hand, Subnautica 2 looks to be an extension of everything that made the original so great, and remains the number one game on ‘the ‘Most Wishlisted Upcoming Steam Games.’ The lawsuit could affect its date, but 2026 is on the cards for now.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember the sentence earlier on saying: “One VERY anticipated game sticks out on this list like a sore thumb,” where delays were possible? Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate all media in 2026. Movies, TV, Games; it doesn’t matter. The big caveat being IF it comes out in 2026. ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is GTA 6 coming out</a>?’ might be the most asked question on Earth. The November 5, 2025, Grand Theft Auto 6 delay announcement broke everyone’s hearts, and there have been suggestions that it could be pushed back to 2027. </p>



<p>You never know with Rockstar Games and GTA.</p>



<p><strong>Current release window: 2026 (Hopefully!)</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve got a missing game that should be on this list or you vehemently disagree with IG’s selections, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place for your guidance or grievances.</p>

<p>Heartopia has plenty to get stuck into as you explore an idyllic life in a new location, but the wording inside the game can be quite confusing, especially when it comes to the Resident’s Request Office.</p>



<p>Starting off in Heartopia results in an avalanche of information being thrown your way, which you will naturally want to get rid of as soon as possible so you can focus on playing, but that can result in you inadvertently skipping past some important details.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia and have no idea where to look, Insider Gaming has got you covered with this guide.</p>

<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is not a location you can actually visit in the game, which has caused a lot of confusion.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, the Resident’s Request Office is a menu you access in the game to track your progress, as it acts as a hub for both Daily and Weekly Requests. </p>



<p>To access the Resident’s Request office, <strong>click on the calendar-like icon on the top-left of the screen, </strong>which is located next to the map.</p>

<p><strong>The Resident’s Request Office in Heartopia is extremely handy for keeping track of mini objectives in the game, which can earn you neat rewards.</strong></p>



<p>Each day, a fresh batch of requests will be made available, and more requests are available every week. Completing them provides a range of rewards, including Gold, Wishing Stars, and Contribution Medals.</p>



<p>Contribution Medals are the most important of these rewards, as they tally together to increase your D.G. Member Level, unlocking additional features like additional Hobbies, extra plots by your house, and more.</p>
