<figure data-uuid="3449ea41b04fe"><a title="Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World DK Spaceport" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3449ea41b04fe/donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world-dk-spaceport.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> may have just received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mario-kart-world-has-been-updated-to-version-1-4-0-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">a rather hefty update</a>, fans of the Switch 2 launch game have been eagerly anticipating any potential DLC that will come to the racer. And a recent datamine of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has brought all of those hopes and dreams to the surface (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-set-to-finally-acknowledge-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-character-and-fans-are-now-convinced-the-timing-points-to-mario-kart-world-dlc">IGN</a>!).</p>
<p>So, some context: earlier this week, Nintendo updated its news app with a suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-today-mobile-app-update-adds-a-new-donkey-kong-theme">Donkey Kong themes</a>, with many of them seemingly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Fans decided to datamine the themes and see which Kong characters would be appearing in the future and over on Famiboards, user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/donkey-kong-community-st2-ohhh-bananza.14427/page-64#post-2086247">MondoMega shared the results</a>, and there were a few surprises.</p>
<p>Now, beyond this point, we'll be going into <strong>big Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> <strong>spoilers</strong>, so if you haven't beaten the game yet and want to be surprised, then stop reading right now; the spoilers will be after the image.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c3b2a8231e02"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c3b2a8231e02/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Watch out, spoilers below! — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It turns out, none other than King K. Rool will be featuring on the app on 15th December. Nintendo has rarely acknowledged the villainous croc in recent years, besides his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, and Donkey Kong Bananza's endgame — and his role as the final boss — was a huge surprise to many. Kritters will also be appearing a few days prior, on 9th.</p>
<p>Now, why would Nintendo have K. Rool pop up on the calendar on 15th December? Honestly, it may well be a harmless bit of promotion. Nintendo features multiple characters unrelated to game releases on the app.</p>
<p>But the timing of this update, and all of the assets coming from Bananza (you can see all of the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">datamined animations on Mario Wiki</a> - beware of spoilers, obviously) has people fervently speculating; will King K. Rool be added to Mario Kart World?</p>
<p>It's not just baseless speculation, either; shortly after Bananza launched, eagle-eyed players noticed that both King K. Rool <em>and</em> Void Kong's voices <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">were listed in Mario Kart World's credits</a>, but neither character was in the game.</p>
<p>So will we be getting some DLC news soon? The Game Awards are next week, but Nintendo rarely makes an appearance at the ceremony, with its biggest announcements there being Bayonetta Origins and a variety of Smash Bros. DLC. Could the Big N buck the trend in 2025? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, take this with a pinch of salt. We'd <em>love</em> to see K. Rool in a kart, but we won't get our hopes up just yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s taken a lot to get here, but deep at the bottom of the Great Mines in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Metroid-Prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, Samus faces the greatest challenge yet on the planet Viewros. You know it’s going to be a rough time when you’re fighting something Omega in a Metroid game…</p>
<p>Now, obviously, <strong>this guide contains spoilers </strong>for Metroid Prime 4, so <strong>stop reading at this point if you are not currently at the final battle of the Great Mines</strong> in the game.</p>
<p>OK… so everyone that’s still here would like some helpful hints? Let’s go.</p>


<h2>Great Mines Omega Boss – First Phase</h2>
<h3>Wall Crawler</h3>
<p>The Omega boss in the Great Mines is a pretty challenging one to tackle, and it fights you in two modes, moves quickly and has long periods of invulnerability.</p>
<p>To start, the Omega Griever scurries around from side to side, high up on the walls of the battle arena. From there, t regularly stops and fires a series of green globs of gloop that slow you and deal damage over time if they hit. Look out for it winding up to start spitting and try to dodge and jump to the sides to evade.</p>


<p>While in this mode, the Omega Griever is hiding its weak spot on the chest and won’t take any damage, but it can be staggered. You need to aim to hit the fleshy coloured parts of its body, as opposed to the black armoured or green glowing sections –&nbsp;you’ll know you’re hitting when it glows gold. Just rapid fire the beam cannon during this and try to lead the target as it moves. The difficulty is that the Omega Griever can dash and break your lock-on, so be ready to quickly release and retarget.</p>
<p>Once enough hits have landed, the Omega Griever will be fatigued and drop to reveal the red weak spot on its chest. Hit this with as much damage as possible –&nbsp;a Super Missile does the trick! –&nbsp;and it will drop to the floor.</p>

<h3>Floor Battle</h3>
<p>Now that the Griever is on the floor, it gets more inventive with its attacks. Here’s what you need to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Sticky Green Gloop</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever projectile vomits green gloop in a cone to its front. This will slow and damage Samus, and you need to mash A to free yourself.<br>
<strong>Claw Attack</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever gets close and swipes with its big arms in turn. Try to keep your distance and jump or dodge away.<br>
<strong>Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever slams on the floor, creating a shockwave that you can avoid by jumping over the top.<br>
<strong>Tongue Grab</strong> –&nbsp;Whipping out its long tentacle-like tongue, the Griever tries to grab Samus and draw her in. Deal as much damage to the tongue as possible while grabbed to get free.</p>

<p>During this phase you need to keep blasting, aiming for exposed fleshy limbs to stun the Omega Griever. Once stunned it slumps to the ground, but its weak spot is still covered. Change to the morph ball, roll under and lay some bombs quickly. This now puts the Omega Griever into a proper damage phase, leaning back to expose its chest.</p>

<p>Unload everything you have with super missiles and charged beam shots, but beware that it can unleash a gloop attack and escape once the stunlock is up.</p>

<h2>Omega Griever – Second Phase</h2>
<p>After taking around one third damage, the Omega Griever will try to escape and crash through a part of the wall, creating some ammo and health that you can absorb with while charging up a beam shot. It also causes some basic and explosive Grievers to spawn. Take them out quickly and it will start to crawl around the walls once more.</p>

<p>It moves a bit quicker now, and has more crusted black armour that is truly invulnerable, but it’s the same process of hitting the fleshy bits to stun, and then the weak spot to drop the Omega Griever to the floor.</p>
<p>Once on the floor, prepare yourself for variants of the same attacks and one new one:</p>
<p><strong>Big Green Ball</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever rolls up and throws a big green ball at Samus. Keep moving to avoid.<br>
Leaping Claw Attack –&nbsp;Now there are up to three swipes and the Griever will leap forward to try and hit Samus.<br>
<strong>Double Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;It now hits the ground in quick succession. Just time a late double jump<br>
Sticky Green Gloop &amp; Tongue Grab are the same.</p>

<p>Again, keep hitting exposed flesh, morph ball and bomb its chest when stunned, and Super Missile the chest when you can.</p>
<h2>Omega Griever Third Phase</h2>
<p>Once down to its final third of health, the Omega Griever again escapes and smashes into the wall, summons lesser Grievers and grows more armour. It might be faster now, but follow the same methods as before to get it down to the ground.</p>
<p>Once on the ground be aware of new and modified attacks:</p>
<p><strong>Laser Beam</strong> –&nbsp;The Omega Griever does a full 360º&nbsp;laser beam attack that you need to jump over to avoid. This does also leave a temporary gas cloud at the edge of the arena, so don’t get too far away.<br>
<strong>Quad Ground Pound</strong> –&nbsp;Two double ground pounds from its lower and upper arms. Time your double jumps to avoid.<br>
Quad Claw Attack –&nbsp;It’s just four back-to-back claw attacks. Keep your distance.</p>

<p>Keep hitting exposed flesh, and get to that weak point!</p>
<h2><strong>Omega Griever Trick Phase!</strong></h2>
<p>Eventually the Omega Griever falls, flopping to the ground and dropping a power up… but wait! It’s a trap!</p>

<p>The Omega Griever grabs you when you get close and starts sapping your life. Shoot it a ton in the face to be released and go for one last ground fight phase. You know what to do and everything it can do by now. Finish the fight!</p>
<hr>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve just earned the final major upgrade in the game, and are into the final stretch. You now need to head back out, but there’s one last thing you should do in the Great Mines before leaving: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/">look for the Scout Bot</a>.</p>

            <guid>1374445</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a full week out from Black Friday, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Sony. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Pro on sale for $101 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This latest model of the console has recently been priced as high as $750, but for the holiday season, you can grab the system of just $649.</a></p>
<h2>The PS5 Has No Games</h2>
<p data-start="136" data-end="775">Alrighty, we all love to go online and make jokes. The recurring meme around the PS5 is that the system “has no games.” It’s become a tired bit at this point. When you step back from the jokes and actually look at what the console has to offer several years into its lifespan, the idea that the PS5 is starving for content just doesn’t hold up. While it would have been nice to have a more exclusives, the current library is anything but empty.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The PS5 Has Tons of Games</h2>
<p data-start="777" data-end="1567">A standout title of this generation is Ghost of Yōtei. This visually striking and mechanically tight action game that showcases the PS5’s graphical and performance capabilities better than anything in its wake. Then there’s Returnal, a fast-paced third-person shooter with roguelike elements that blends frenetic combat with an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of classic Metroid titles. It’s challenging, stylish, and moody. Gotta love it. And of course, Astro Bot marks a triumphant return to the 3D mascot platformer, a genre we’ve been missing for far too long. This game is a charming, heartfelt celebration of PlayStation’s history, packed with creativity from start to finish. The game’s quality and infectious fun earned it the title of 2024’s <em data-start="1508" data-end="1526">Game of the Year</em> at The Game Awards—well-deserved.</p>


<p data-start="1569" data-end="2375">If you happened to skip the PlayStation 4 generation entirely, the PS5 becomes an even more enticing system. You’ll find a treasure trove of beloved titles waiting to be experienced for the first time, with some receiving enhancements specifically for Sony’s latest console. Games like The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II continue to dominate discussions about storytelling in video games. The first entry is widely regarded as one of the strongest narratives the medium has ever produced, while the second remains divisive—but passionately defended by many fans who appreciate its bold thematic choices. Regardless of where you ultimately land, both games offer emotionally charged journeys through a post-apocalyptic world that became iconic enough to inspire a major HBO adaptation. Worth checking out at the very least.</p>
<p data-start="2377" data-end="2801">For players who want access to a large back catalog without purchasing every title individually, PlayStation Plus Premium is an excellent gateway. The subscription grants access to hundreds of games spanning multiple PlayStation generations. You can dive into acclaimed modern titles like Control, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as older classics that shaped the platform’s legacy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Witcher’s Ciri actor has stated that she spent some time considering whether they should leave the series, along with Henry Cavill. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Witcher series first had Henry Cavill playing Geralt of Rivia; however, he had to leave the show before it ended, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-season-four-first-clip-hemsworth-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hemsworth</a> stepping in to wrap up the rest of the seasons as Geralt. Henry Cavill’s leaving was shocking news to all the fans, and it seems it was a shock to cast members as well, because one of them considered quitting along with him. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-ciri-didn-t-know-henry-cavill-was-leaving-until-a-day-before-the-news-broke">The Witcher’s Ciri Didn’t Know Henry Cavill Was Leaving Until a Day Before the News Broke</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/tv-interviews/freya-allan-interview-the-witcher-netflix-ciri-henry-cavill-3915069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NME</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-witcher-ciri-actor-says-she-considered-quitting-the-show-with-former-star-henry-cavill-hes-the-geralt-i-grew-up-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), The Witcher’s Ciri actor, Freya Allan, opened up about considering quitting with Henry Cavill. Allan spoke about how season 3 of the show was difficult for everyone and how she was only informed about Henry Cavill quitting one day before it was announced to the public. Allan added that she cried as she wanted to complete the series with the guy who had played her “adoptive father”. </p>



<p>Allan added that, for the first time, she began to see what life would be like away from The Witcher and spent a “solid amount of time” considering whether she should quit her role as Ciri alongside Henry Cavill. However, as we all know, she ultimately chose to stay back and make the most of every moment. Allan also talked about how she was inspired to take on Henry’s role after he left, who was always so “knowledgeable and loyal to the books, push for certain lines to be included.” </p>

                <p>AdHoc CEO Michael Choung thinks most studios should avoid episodic releases, a stance he makes clear even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dispatch-review-fantastic-superhero-tv/1900-6418442/" data-ref-id="1900-6418442">Dispatch</a>--the studio’s debut superhero workplace comedy--has become a runaway success. Choung says the weekly-release format that helped Dispatch explode past 1 million sales in 10 days and put it on track to hit its three-year sales target in just three months was difficult at every turn and an actual "insane thing to do."</p><p>Speaking to technology newsletter <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Knowledge</a>, Choung recalled being warned repeatedly that releasing the game week by week instead of all at once was a terrible idea. But the team believed the format was essential for the story. "What's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a video game, all meshing and rubbing up against each other," he said. The narrative had always been structured episodically, even though it went against industry "conventional wisdom."</p>

<p>Despite internal debate, AdHoc settled on releasing two episodes weekly rather than dropping the game all at once, splitting it into halves, or spacing out individual episodes. The bet paid off dramatically. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered," Choung explained. This kind of schedule created a sense that "the train is leaving the station, but not just yet--I can still make it," which encouraged players to jump in. Contrary to expectations that week-two numbers would fall, concurrent users kept doubling with each release.</p><p>"Those things, we anticipated. I don't think we anticipated the scale of it," he said.</p><p>Still, Choung insists this approach shouldn't become a trend. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!” he said. While AdHoc would be "thrilled" to see others succeed with the model, he stresses that it is grueling and risky.</p><p>Beyond release strategy, AdHoc has also drawn attention for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-studio-weighs-in-on-the-ai-debate-in-gaming/1100-6536310/" data-ref-id="1100-6536310">rejecting AI as a replacement for creative roles.</a> "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," said creative director Nick Herman. "Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative."</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has shared his thoughts on the use of AI in video games, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>Howard sat down with Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones at an event for the second season of Fallout earlier this week. While much of the discussion focused on the Amazon series, Mat took the chance to ask Howard about AI, which remains a hotly debated topic within the industry.</p>

<p>"I view it as a tool," Howard told Mat. "Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.</p>
<p>"But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. </p>
<p>"I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop."</p>
<p>"That's our view on it," the Bethesda head closed. "But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p>
<p>Howard's words come as more and more developers are dipping their toes - or at times their whole foot - into the technology. AI has been used across all levels of game development, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPCs like those in the recently-released Where Winds Meet</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, reported that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. In 2025, that number is likely to be higher, and a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines as we march confidently towards the end of the year. Just this afternoon, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Netflix announced this morning that it’s <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros?ref=aftermath.site"><u>acquiring Warner Bros</u></a>, in an $82.7 billion deal that will see the streamer take control of HBO, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hbo-max-warner/"><u>HBO Max</u></a>, and WB’s TV and film studios. Reportedly, the sale will also include WB Games, announced in <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-mortal-kombat-dc-universe-1236436062/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>June </u></a>as becoming part of the WB “streaming and studios” division that Netflix has purchased. This means that Netflix, a company that seems to have no idea what to do with the games studios it already owns, could own more games studios.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game Developer</u></a>’s Chris Kerr received confirmation from a WB spokesperson that WB Games is going to Netflix, following what was reportedly a brief appearance of the Mortal Kombat logo in a Netflix conference call this morning. WB Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflix-could-own-all-these-warner-bros-game-studios-soon/2900-7310/?ref=aftermath.site#14"><u>includes studios</u></a> like Rocksteady, who make the Arkham games; Avalanche, who made <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>; and Lego games maker TT Games. Previously, WB Games restructured around–<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad/"><u>shudder</u></a>–IP like Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and DC. Netflix noted <em>Game of Thrones </em>and DC specifically in its press release about the sale, writing “Beloved franchises, shows and movies such as <em>The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,</em> <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and the DC Universe will join Netflix’s extensive portfolio including <em>Wednesday, Money Heist, Bridgerton, Adolescence </em>and <em>Extraction</em>, creating an extraordinary entertainment offering for audiences worldwide.”</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7aod3dpxs2n" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreie4jtm6iqvtdjefv54ggjo3pfp7qj7ebbxdodkvnp4kakwhtzuwd4"><p lang="en">I also attended the full Netflix conference call discussing the proposed deal and the VAST majority of chatter was focused on film and television (and IP ownership). 

This 'Business Overview' slide contained the only mention of WB's video game business.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Kerr (@kerrblimey.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:t53ijuodvbcjbislhyu6te4r/post/3m7aod3dpxs2n?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-05T14:14:59.104Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>That Netflix doesn’t seem to be touting the games part of this deal is perhaps no surprise. After dipping its toe into games as early as 2018’s <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> (which it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-to-remove-black-mirror-bandersnatch-from-platform-in-an-effort-to-ditch-interactive-programming?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pulled from the platform</u></a> earlier this year), Netflix has been clumsily ramping its games efforts up and down. After <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/expanding-our-games-team-with-the-acquisition-of-night-school-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>buying</u></a> <em>Oxenfree </em>developer Night School in 2021 and opening <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>some games studios</u></a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2022</u></a>, Netflix has been closing and selling studios and changing its strategy since. A AAA game reportedly in development from Netflix’s California studio was cancelled when <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the studio was shut down</u></a> in 2024; Netflix went on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed/"><u>close Boss Fight</u></a>, the studio behind its <em>Squid Game</em> mobile game, earlier this year, and just this week it sold <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Cozy Grove</u></em></a> developer Spry Fox back to its founders. At the same time, Netflix has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>rehashing</u></a> an effort to focus on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-11-14/netflix-games-on-tv-how-to-play-boggle-pictionary-tv-games?ref=aftermath.site"><u>TV-based social games</u></a>, as well as games for kids, offering games on its service like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>GTA</em>, and tie-ins to its own programming (despite, again, closing the studio that made its <em>Squid Game</em> tie-in).</p><p>None of this has thus far equated to a comprehensive, successful games strategy. As <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed/"><u>Nicole wrote</u></a> when Boss Fight was shuttered:</p><blockquote>[P]eople don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>That a company with no idea what it’s doing in games would now own <em>even more games</em> feels like a recipe for disaster. If Netflix is actively interested in WB's game offerings at all, it could want them for the same reason WB wanted them–for the <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav/"><u>tie-ins</u></a>– but it’s already shown itself to be unable to handle the opportunities it currently has in that space. Not that WB is a model of success here either; it closed three studios back in February, including one working on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODkzMTgwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTM2NjA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJDMzlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.I9EjU4x5-ZG-gThi468SKf5IF8l5lg2jKLB9q7K5vyM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wonder Woman</u></a> game. At both Netflix and WB, the men in suits seem to get as far as “people like video games, and also movies and TV” and then have no idea what to do next, costing games workers their jobs in the process.</p><p>And all <em>this</em> is to say nothing of all the potential ramifications of one company owning even <em>more</em> media properties and streaming platforms, with Netflix already <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-warner-bros-movies-theaters-buying-studio-1236601073/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>musing</u></a> about its plans for theatrical releases. The deal still needs to go through regulatory review, and the restructure that sees WB Games fall under the company’s streaming offerings is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-post-separation-company-names-executive-leadership-teams-1236472168/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>still in progress</u></a>, so there are a lot of unknowns in terms of how things could look once, and if, everything is finalized. But there’s no reason to assume Netflix will suddenly get its shit together if it ends up with more games studios to flail around with. Maybe a handful of companies <em>shouldn’t</em> own everything? </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Netflix announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire Warner Bros., including HBO Max, HBO, its film, television, and gaming studios, for $82.7 billion.</p>



<p>As you may recall, Warner Bros. Discovery was formed following the merger of AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia division with Discovery, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on May 17, 2021</a>, and officially completed on April 8, 2022. Around a year ago, however, WBD executives decided to split the division into two separate units: the more profitable Streaming &amp; Studios and the less profitable Global Linear Networks, with the split expected to be complete by mid-2026.</p>



<p>Ever since that announcement, speculation ran rampant that the goal was to sell off the more appealing Streaming &amp; Studios to the highest bidder, and that's exactly what happened today. Previous rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-rumored-to-be-considering-warner-bros-discovery-streaming-and-studios-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Sony might have been interested. As of last month, WBD execs were officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evaluating different offers from multiple parties</a>. It's not surprising that Netflix won, given its financial resources.</p>



<p>There was the lingering doubt of whether such an acquisition would include WB's gaming studios. Surprisingly, it seems that the answer is positive. This means Avalanche Software (Hogwarts Legacy), NetherRealm Games (Mortal Kombat, Injustice), Rocksteady Games (Batman: Arkham, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League), and TT Games (LEGO) will go under Netflix's control. The WB Games division was <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank">restructured</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, following the closure of Monolith Productions (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor/War), PlayerFirst Games (MultiVersus), and San Diego Studio, as well as</span> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of its CEO</a>, David Haddad. </p>



<p>The goal was to focus entirely on the four big owned franchises: DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, and Mortal Kombat. Whether Netflix agrees with the strategy remains to be seen, though. Their gaming efforts so far have been mixed. They <a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> Oxenfree developer Night School Studios and a few mobile developers, including Spry Fox, which was recently sold back to its original owners. In 2022, they <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-aims-to-have-50-mobile-games-available-by-the-end-of-2022/" target="_blank">expanded their mobile game offerings</a>&nbsp;available through the subscription model and also&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-reportedly-working-on-aaa-pc-third-person-action-rpg/" target="_blank">founded a studio</a>&nbsp;to develop</span> a triple-A action RPG designed by several industry veterans. However, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed down that studio</a> about a year ago.</p>



<p>Right now, it's anyone's guess what their gaming strategy will be. Below, you can find prepared statements from Netflix and WB executives regarding the acquisition, which is expected to close within twelve to eighteen months.</p>



<p>Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, stated:</p>



<p><em>Our mission has always been to entertain the world. By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends—with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters, and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.</em></p>



<p>Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, added:</p>



<p><em>This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come. Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.</em></p>



<p>David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said:</p>



<p><em>Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most. For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world’s attention, and shaped our culture.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It has been 13 long years since Aaron Foster last <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/15/3507340/routine-sci-fi-horror-game">spoke</a> to <em>The Verge</em>. Back then, Foster’s tiny, three-person studio Lunar Software was touting sci-fi horror game <em>Routine</em> with a striking vision: Foster hoped to suck players into the desolate eeriness of its moon base setting, which was equal parts immersive and grounded. Foster ended that interview by swerving a release date question. With 13 years of hindsight, it reads like an all-timer understatement. “Making a good game is more important than a hard-set deadline,” he said. “So we will keep it loose for now.”</p><p>Now, nearly a decade and a half on, <a href="https://www.routinegame.com/"><em>Routine </em>has been released on Steam and Xbox</a>. Better yet — miraculously, even — the game appears to bear little trace of its turbulent and protracted development. This is visually ravishing hard sci-fi with some of the most committed diegetic design I’ve ever seen in a video game. There is no heads-up display and no health gauge, nor is there any omniscient text directing you where to go. Instead, you must pay close attention to everything. Such is the concentration the game demands, likely causing you to literally lean into the screen; it can feel as if you are actually there, inhabiting the physical space of this magnificently believable lunar base.</p><p>Foster has made the game for a very specific type of video game aficionado, himself included. “I just appreciate it when I’m playing a game that I forget that I’m actually playing a game,” he says in a new interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Often UI brings you out of the experience.”</p><p>Foster, who serves as art and design lead on the game, says that he and his partner, assistant lead artist and designer Jemma Hughes, go to great lengths to foster this kind of experience in games not expressly designed for them. The pair played online multiplayer survival game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F440900%2FConan_Exiles%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Conan Exiles</em></a> with a self-imposed modifier: Neither person is allowed to look at the map. “We could only navigate the world through memory,” says Foster, “and that changes how you interact with the spaces.”</p><p>Your Cosmonaut Assistance Tool — or CAT — is the best example of how hard Lunar Software has pushed this diegetic approach in<em> Routine</em>. CAT is an ungainly multifunctional electronic device with a chunky, 1980s-inspired look. You can hold it like a firearm, aiming the reticule through a small, low-res screen, pinging off bolts of electricity at the imposing robots that stalk the station. You can also hold CAT up, revealing buttons on its side and a bar showing how much battery life remains. Press one button and, if you’re standing next to a terminal with a projector, the in-game menu (tracking objectives and other useful information) appears. There is no way to access this menu by conventionally pressing Start or Esc; the menu must be accessed <em>through</em> the game world.</p><p>CAT, and the overall sinister atmosphere, is visible in the very first 2012 <a href="https://youtu.be/FnhYRaotzdg">trailer</a>. Not long before, Foster had quit his job as a 3D environment artist at Eurocom, a large UK-based studio that specialized in licensed games. He was feeling burned out and creatively unfulfilled, working on personal projects in the evening. This grueling double life caused him to overdose on caffeine. He wasn’t able to focus on any of his work, and he suffered from nosebleeds.</p><p>At first, Foster saw <em>Routine</em> as a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F520720%2FDear_Esther_Landmark_Edition%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Dear Esther</em></a><em>-</em>esque walking simulator. “I thought I could make something visually distinct, if not with the great writing of Dan Pinchbeck,” he says. Soon after, programmer Pete Dissler came on board, which meant more involved systems could be implemented. In 2011, Foster, Dissler, and Hughes formed Lunar Software, moving into an apartment together in Preston, an industrial town in the north of England. They became like a tightly knit three-piece band. Foster and Hughes still live in the same flat; they became a couple in the early stages of production.</p><p>For a time, <em>Routine</em>’s production went smoothly. The team built environments and mechanics, while Mick Gordon, composer and audio designer on titles like <em>Prey </em>and <em>Doom</em>, joined the trio, designing its intricately machinic soundscape (listen closely for the ambient whirs and clicks of the door’s internal mechanisms). Yet slowly, the game began to lose focus. “We tried to solve problems with design by just throwing more things at it, more environments to navigate, more this, more that. None of it added anything to the experience,” says Foster. “It felt like a very shallow experience that we weren’t creatively in a good spot to fix.”</p><p>A <a href="https://youtu.be/AOiY_QfOCwE">release date trailer</a> arrived in 2016; the team missed that deadline. Health issues struck various team members; what savings they had ran out. Foster and Hughes were reliant on Hughes’ parents for financial support. “We didn’t pay ourselves a wage,” says Hughes. “We were running on fumes.” Some of the team took on contract work; others did odd jobs. In effect, development shut down.</p><p>Then, in 2020, flickers of life. Lunar had pitched a prototype for a different game about a bounty-hunting frog, which they’d been working on as a means to keep their spirits up, to Raw Fury. The publisher was more interested in revisiting Lunar’s shelved project. “They’re like, ‘Aren’t you the folks that are working on <em>Routine</em>? What’s your feelings on returning to that project?’” recalls Foster. “‘Very, very fucking positive,’” he told them.</p><p>Many developers spend years toiling on their passion projects: Acclaimed autobiographical life simulator <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791220/consume-me-review-steam"><em>Consume Me</em></a> took 10 years to make; lauded Metroidvanias <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGTEF6LfzqM"><em>Ultros</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, and gorgeous soccer adventure <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/664363/despelote-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Despelote</em></a>, all took approximately seven years. There are many tales of blockbuster development hell: <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em> and the ongoing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a>. But <em>Routine</em> is unique. Early into this second iteration of the project, Foster and his colleagues had a realization. “We were essentially doing a remake of our own game,” he says. “But without the game having ever been released. It was very strange.”</p><div><p>“We were essentially doing a remake of our own game.”</p></div><p>Chief among Lunar’s initial tasks on the second run was creating practically every asset from scratch as they shifted production from the relatively humdrum Unreal Engine 3 to its successor. The team borrowed a texturing technique from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/4/5960489/star-citizen"><em>Star Citizen</em></a> (another game languishing in its own development hell), and the lighting looks so ravishing because it has been baked into the levels, diffusing naturally through every ominously long corridor.</p><p>During <em>Routine</em>’s most stressful moments, lumbering foes, likely having spotted your helmet poking out from behind a counter, click into thundering gear. There are doors that you can close to halt them momentarily, except — oh no! — you may fumble closing one because you must aim your cursor at the terminal screen itself rather than locking on to it automatically. It’s an interface style that was cribbed from <em>Doom 3</em>, and is representative of <em>Routine</em> as a whole: It riffs on the familiar yet manages to feel fresh.</p><p>Given all of that work, how did the team maintain motivation on the project for all that time? “We just couldn’t live in a world where <em>Routine</em> didn’t release,” says Hughes. Foster, 26 when the project started and now 40, cites devotion as the primary reason behind how they kept going. “If we didn’t love <em>Routine</em> as much as we do, it wouldn’t have gotten us through the hard times.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/838639/routine-sci-fi-horror-game-development]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Postal developers Running With Scissors have revealed... and now cancelled Postal: Bullet Paradise, a spin-off shooter created by Goonswarm Studios. It seems Bullet Paradise may have featured some AI-generated material, which has prompted an evidently massive backlash among the Postal faithful in the literal two whole days since the project's announcement. Gosh.
</p>
<p>
"After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community," reads a statement from Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi, emailed to RPS this afternoon. "The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.
</p>
<p>
"We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continues. "Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don't).
</p>
<p>
"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team," it concludes. "Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the POSTAL franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can't wait to share more!"
</p>
<p>
Postal: Bullet Paradise was once "a timeline-hopping, dystopian bullet heaven first-person shooter with POSTAL's signature darkly humorous personality". The project is "no longer available" on Steam, though it still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise/">has a page</a> as of writing.
</p>
<p>
Desi's statement doesn't mention which elements of the game may have been AI-generated, or whether they've taken any steps to confirm this with Goonswarm. I've mailed the devs to ask for comment. Their previous games include Sin Slayers: Meat &amp; Greed and SCP: Control Error.
</p><p>
Assuming this <em>is</em> a case of generative AI, it would be the first time to my knowledge that a publisher has canned a whole game following blowback on the subject from players. Publishers have apologised for games having generated AI elements - see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">11 Bit's response to controversy over The Alters</a> - and taken steps to replace them - see <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-says-ai-generated-art-in-anno-117-was-a-placeholder-which-slipped-through-our-review-process/">Ubisoft and Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> - but yoinking the whole thing from development is quite the escalation. I'll update if we learn more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you missed snapping up a powerful speaker with bold sound from a known brand during Black Friday, Amazon is offering another chance to save big.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">We just spotted the ultra-portable JBL Clip 5 going for $57 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed 29% off its usual (and already affordable) $80 price tag.</a> This deal applies to the classic black model. If you’re looking for something with a bit more personality, several other options are going for less, too. The stunning red and the beautiful blue, for instance, are sitting at $60, after a sweet $10 discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy a three-month free trial of Amazon Music with your purchase, which is going to make vibing and jamming a lot more fun. The only catch is that the deal is selling out fast. If you’ve been after a reliable, lightweight speaker, now is the time to act before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry Around</h2>
<p>This portable speaker features a compact frame and includes a fully integrated carabiner with a much wider opening. Slip your fingers through to carry it around, hook it to your backpack, or just toss it in your purse and get going. Since it’s quite lightweight, it doesn’t add unnecessary bulk, either.</p>
<p>Of course, small size doesn’t mean average performance; this speaker punches well above its weight. There’s a powerful driver and passive radiator for bigger, louder JBL Pro Sound with deep, rich bass that brings all your favorite tunes to life. It’s great for energy-filled songs, plus catching up on podcasts on the go. You can even pair it with your laptop or phone while streaming shows for a room-filling, immersive audio experience. Installing the JBL app takes the experience even further by letting you choose between audio options, tweak sound settings, install the latest updates, and more. The speaker is quite strong on its own, but you can always pair two of these with Auracast for an even bigger setup. Planning to host a fun gathering this New Year’s? Ask a friend to bring theirs and enjoy your own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>



<p>The party goes all night with Clip 5’s strong battery that offers up to 12 hours of playtime on a single. Running low, but don’t want to stop the music? Hit the Playtime Boost to add up to three more hours to your playtime. Translation? Non-stop fun all night (and the next day) long. You can take out on your off-road adventures without a worry. Speaking of off-road adventures, the speaker is made to handle all weather and environmental conditions. This exceptional durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating. A few water splashes by the pool or a couple of drops in the sand at the beach won’t hurt the functionality.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been after a power speaker in a portable design that doesn’t put a dent in your wallet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">the JBL Clip 5 is a great option to consider. Amazon is offering it for just $58 today, making the upgrade much more affordable</a>. You’ll also get 90 days free of Amazon Music with your purchase, which gets you instant access to thousands of ad-free songs, ad-free podcasts, offline downloads, and more. It even offers one free audiobook from Audible’s large catalog every month. After the free trial, your subscription will continue at $11 per month ($10 for Prime members), if you choose to keep it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Legendary game developer Tim Cain has returned to the gaming industry spotlight to team up with Obsidian Entertainment once again, and they’ve confirmed that they’re working on a new game already.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know, Tim Cain helped mastermind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> franchise and co-directed The Outer Worlds, amongst other work. The developer semi-retired several years ago, but has announced that he’s back into the swing of things with Obsidian, and is developing a mystery game.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Back again. Credit to Obsidian</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a December 5 ‘Cain On Games Update’ on his YouTube channel, Cain discussed what was happening in his life regarding game development and the next steps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m back at Obsidian. I’m there, full-time employee, and in person. So not remote. I’m not a contractor anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Cain explained that while he will have his name attached to at least one other game coming up—due to his relaxed contractor status in recent times—he is now firmly on Obsidian’s books. Cain explained that he’s not at liberty to discuss the new project, and it gives more questions than it does answers:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I also can’t talk about the project I’m working on at Obsidian, just because that’s covered under NDA. Don’t bother guessing, you’re not gonna guess right.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Cain explains that he’s “A lot less retired now,” and this new game will likely be the center of his focus moving forward.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video and everything said by Cain about the life change.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Outer Worlds and The Outer Worlds 2 have been the two main games Cain has worked on in the last 10 years. It’ll be interesting to see what the new title is, but it’s hard to imagine it’s not something to do with an RPG!</p>



<p>What do you think Cain is working on? Is it an old IP being brought back to life? Or is Obsidian cooking up yet another franchise?

                <p>Nintendo enthusiasts believe that an announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> DLC is imminent, though it takes a few steps to reach that conclusion.</p><p>Evidence, fans believe, stems from datamined information from the Nintendo Today app, which shares daily bite-sized pieces of news and offers several themes based on various Nintendo franchises. A new Donkey Kong theme came to the app recently, and per datamines (which you can see on <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Wiki</a>), it looks like the app will highlight a character that had a surprise appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p><em>Spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza to follow!</em></p><p>An intro animation for DK's nemesis, King K. Rool, is purportedly set to feature in the Nintendo Today app on December 15. It'll be the first time Nintendo officially acknowledges his presence in Bananza, since his role was a big plot twist in the game. So, how does that relate to Mario Kart World DLC?</p><p>Back when Mario Kart World launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sharp-eyed players noticed</a> that the Japanese voice performers for K. Rool and Bananza boss Void Kong appeared in the credits, despite their characters not appearing in the kart racer. While it's possible that the two voice actors played different roles in the base game, fans took it as evidence that a Donkey Kong Bananza-themed expansion is coming to Mario Kart World.</p><p>The timing of K. Rool's Nintendo Today animation rolling out a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025 streams</a> on December 11 has fans trying to connect some dots, believing that putting K. Rool in the spotlight would tie in well with a possible DLC announcement at the awards show.</p><p>It isn't the most implausible theory--Nintendo has made announcements at The Game Awards in previous years, and the relatively paltry number of costumes for Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World leaves room for a big DK-centered expansion.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, Mario Kart fans are hungry for more. Despite being the marquee launch title for Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">sales nearly matching those of the console itself</a>, there hasn't been any acknowledgement or hint of post-release content for Mario Kart World. At the very least, Nintendo has continued to update the game, most recently with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-out-now-adds-custom-item-rules-and-more/1100-6536657/" data-ref-id="1100-6536657">big patch that added features</a> like custom item rules.</p>

            <p>It's been an unexpectedly rough year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The game, which many assumed would be a massive success after the juggernaut sales of Monster Hunter World, has floundered a little post-launch. Capcom has been eager to point the finger on various factors, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the price of a PS5 being a high barrier to entry</a>, but the fact remains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the game's sales are lagging behind the ageing Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Rise's DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards">IGN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda has appealed to players to consider jumping back into the game again, promising various tweaks the devs have made - and are planning to make - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">have righted the wrongs</a> the game suffered at launch.</p>

<figcaption>Go on, have the video link three days early.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE3wwzzXmkg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>," Tokuda explained. “We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armour.</p><p>"In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users."</p>
<p>This point is notable: many (assumedly now lapsed) players found the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">far too easy</a>, especially by Monster Hunter standards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">The resultant 'overwhelmingly negative' plunge</a> on Steam is partially to blame for the game's lack of stickiness with players, which must have come as something of a shock to Capcom given how loyal MonHun fans typically tend to be.</p>
<p>On the upside, though, various free updates have added more difficult gameplay to the title over the course of the year, and recently we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> crossover go live with an absolute nightmare of an encounter in the form of Omega Planetes - something even end-game veterans struggled to put down.</p>
<p>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again."</p>
<p>Need more motivation? You're in luck: Capcom today announced the next Monster Hunter Showcase will air on Monday, 8th December 8. The showcase will cover Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 and provide us with another look at Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p><p>It'll be broadcast on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> at 2 PM PT / 10 PM GMT. So far, we know Monster Hunter Wilds TU4 will re-introduce us Gogmazios (an oil-slicked Elder Dragon we've not seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>), expand end-game content, bring in new weapon buffs, start a new seasonal event, apply performance improvements, and more besides.</p>
<p>It launches on December 16 for all platforms. Just in time for the holidays, then.</p>

<p>Vroom for four, and 120fps mode to boot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>3Goo, which has previously published the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gear_club_unlimited_2_-_definitive_edition">Gear.Club</a> series and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wrc_generations">WRC Generations</a> on Nintendo consoles, has announced a brand new multiplayer grand-prix racer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/4pgp-four-player-grand-prix">4PGP: Four-Player Grand Prix</a>, which releases on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, has a phenomenally straight-forward moniker, and we reckon that suits its aims as a no-nonsense 90s-style racer just fine, as the keyword here is "simplicity" in being able to pick up and play, with easy to grasp controls.</p>
<p>That extends to the visuals too, in the clean and simplistic graphical style adopted to bring this arcade speeding to life with 4K and 120fps on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The game also features track "design contributions" from Kenji Sasaki, who of course designed the tracks for little known racers such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> and <strong>Sega Rally</strong>. Hold on, what? Excuse us? Oh, and you've also got a soundtrack by Tomoyuki Kawamura, who did the music for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/sega_rally_championship">Sega Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/virtua_racing">Virtua Racing</a>. Wow.</p>
<p>Here's some more deets from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arcade Racing for Every Skill Level:</strong></p>
<p>Four difficulty settings, Rookie, Novice, Veteran, and Expert, as well as an Assist Mode for younger racers, making it easy for newcomers to jump in while giving experienced racers a real challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem with Game Share:</strong></p>
<p>Race solo or with up to four players in split-screen, and join friends with GameShare locally on both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, or play online with others on Nintendo Switch 2 via GameChat.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Game Modes:</strong></p>
<p>Hop into Quick Races for instant fun, tackle a full set of courses in Championship Mode, or chase perfect laps in Time Attack Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Unlockable Tracks and Vehicles:</strong></p>
<p>Race and unlock an expanding lineup of 14 circuits and build out your collection of 19 cars.</p>
<p><strong>90s Vibe, Modern Tech:</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy a 90s-inspired arcade racing feel paired with modern visuals and performance, powered by a custom engine. For Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, the game supports 4K resolution and 120fps.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We like the look of this one, and if 3goo can nail the driving, get the arcade feel just right and give online that works well, this one could fill a proper hole in our Switch libraries when it comes to F1-style racing with pals. We're also totally down for that price point of <strong>$24.99</strong> on Switch 2 and <strong>$19.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>

              <p>Is your Christmas tree missing a little bling? It’s time to add some smart lighting to brighten it up. Govee makes some of our favorite solutions out there, and we just spotted its smart RGBIC Christmas tree lights going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/">On a regular day, these lights would run you around $140, but the retailer just slashed the price by 36%, offering them for just $90 right now</a>. It’s the lowest we have seen them drop to in a long while. It was also originally a Black Friday discount, which managed to survive the main event. You’ll enjoy free delivery on your purchase, which ultimately brings the total down even further. Snap it up quickly, though. Christmas is just around the corner, and we’re expecting these lights to be a popular pick, so both the discount and the stock could run out soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 Million Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>The box includes 24 string lights, with a total of 480 LED beads. Each line is 6.6ft long and features 20 LEDs, making it great for most trees from 6.5ft to 8ft. There’s an 11.5ft power line attached, which allows you to place the lights anywhere without feeling limited. Installation couldn’t be simpler. The lights come with everything you need to put these up, including mounting rings, bar support, cable ties, and U-shaped straps.</p>
<p>Once up, the upgraded LED design, paired with the densely arranged beads, makes for a much smoother, uniform lighting effect. You can choose from 16 million color options (you read that right), plus over 60 versatile preset modes that have something appropriate for every occasion. If you already have a vision in mind, go DIY using the dedicated app, picking your own colors and styles. You can overlap layers, draw a sketch on the app to get specific patterns on the lights, edit patterns, or share your ideas with the AI bot to create unique effects. Don’t have the time for all of that? The preset modes make it easy to choose one within seconds. The Christmas lighting show, for instance, is bright and offers a nice mix of holiday-appropriate colors. Similarly, the “New Year’s” mode is a bit more vibrant, while the “Winter Warm” option brings cozy energy into your space.</p>



<p>The timer section in the app lets you create specific schedules for your lights. There’s a Sleep option to dim them, and a Wake Up to turn them on gradually. What’s more, the lights can also turn on when you clap your hands. Turn it into a game and see who can light them all up in the shortest time!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about these smart lights that can be used for multiple events. You can pick from a range of colors and preset modes, which means you’re no longer stuck with the basic yellow lighting. Maybe go for something bright during the day, and switch to warmer tones at night; the possibilities are endless.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6242/"> Amazon is now letting you grab them for just $90, after taking a whopping 36% off their retail price.</a> Make sure you act fast to grab them, because we’re not expecting the discount or the stock to last long. That said, there are plenty of other lighting solutions by Govee going for less, as well. Now is a great time to stock up on everything you’ve had your eyes on, before the prices shoot back up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Think Mario Kart World Might Get A Big Donkey Kong DLC Any Day Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-dlc-donkey-kong-bananza-game-awards-2000650892</link>
            <guid>1374361</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been six months since <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> launched alongside the Switch 2. There have been some notable patches during that time but no big content updates. Could the game’s first paid DLC be right around the corner? Here’s why some fans think so and why it will feature tie-ins to <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>.</p> <p>Before we go on, here’s a spoiler warning for those who haven’t finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> yet.</p>  <p>So, Nintendo Today news app <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong">dataminers</a> recently discovered an interesting entry for December 15 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/im-convinced-nintendo-might-be-gearing-up-for-a-mario-kart-world-dlc-announcement-as-it-prepares-to-spotlight-a-donkey-kong-bananza-character-its-been-refusing-to-publicly-acknowledge-since-launch/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). It’s an animation featuring <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/File:NT_Day_15_DK.mp4">King K. Rool</a>. He’s a familiar enough Nintendo character at this point, even making it into <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, but the post is also clearly a nod to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> in which the reptile serves as <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178">the surprise final boss</a>. While King K. Rool has been in <em>Smash Bros.</em>, he’s never been in a <em>Mario Kart</em> before.</p>

 <p>What makes this theory extra convincing is that <em>Mario Kart World</em> and<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> already share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/">credits for two voice actors</a>: Yuu Hayashi (Void Kong) and Tsuguo Mogami (King K. Rool). Those two characters are obviously in<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. They are not in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Yet. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>Adding fuel to the speculation is a lot of other circumstantial stuff, like the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards</a>, where Nintendo has often announced big DLCs in the past, is right around the corner, and the base version of<em> Mario Kart World</em> is surprisingly light on costumes and music for <em>Donkey Kong</em>. With Nintendo making such a big push behind the big ape—a big launch year exclusive for the Switch 2, <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">a rumored movie spin-off</a>, and a remaster of an old Wii game—it wouldn’t be shocking to see the first big Mario Kart World expansion be DK-themed.</p>

 <p>Diddy Kong, for example, has been in and out of the series <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038">since <em>Double Das</em>h</a>. He didn’t launch with <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> but was later added in the Booster Pass Course DLCs. Funky Kong, too. I would expect them and more to get added <em>eventually</em>. Now, whether that’s this month or farther down the road is a different question. December totally makes sense for <em>Mario Kart World</em> DLC, but Nintendo doesn’t always do something just because it makes sense.</p> <p>And if we read into every little Nintendo Today news app drop like this, well, fans would be expecting all sorts of wild announcements.</p>

            <p>After receiving pushback for its flagrant use of generative AI, Postal: Bullet Paradise has been cancelled… just two days after being revealed.</p>
<p>In a statement from publisher Running With Scissors, the company said the reception to Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - had "caused extreme damage" to its brand and reputation.</p>

<p>"We've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community," Running with Scissors founder Vince Desi stated today.</p>
<p>The "strong" feedback the publisher recieved said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI. "We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continued, adding the publisher's trust in the development team had been "broken".</p>
<p>As such, Running with Scissors has "killed the project", which would have seen players taking on the mantle of one of the Dudes from across the Postal multiverse.</p>
<p>"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond," the founder closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to share more!"</p>
<p>Postal: Bullet Paradise was announced on 3rd December, with a PC release planned for 2026, before an arrival on PlayStation and Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Running with Scissors' decision to cancel Postal: Bullet Paradise comes as more and more companies are using AI technology. Recent examples include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPC conversations like those in the newly-released Where Winds Meet</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just yesterday, Supertrick Games - the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno - released a statement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">after its own use of AI caused a bit of a stir earlier in the week</a>.</p>

Discovery to acquire Warner Bros. in a deal that's valued at roughly <strong>$82.7 billion</strong> — an equity value of $72 billion.</p>
<p>Netflix is specifically acquiring Warner Bros.' Streaming &amp; Studios company, which <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_presentations/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Investor-Presentation-06-09-25.pdf">it created in June 2025</a> and includes including <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, the DC Universe, <strong>Harry Potter</strong>, <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong>, and platforms such as HBO and HBO Max and Warner Bros. Games.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-ftUzIFBTSc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-ftUzIFBTSc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ftUzIFBTSc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed379e42lxmwys&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The media company doesn't mention WB's gaming division at all in its press release. However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">Game Developer</a> has confirmed with a WB spokesperson that "the recently-restructured video game division... will be joining Netflix."</p>
<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games includes a number of studios such as Rocksteady (<strong>Batman: Arkham</strong> series), NetherRealm Studios (<strong>Mortal Kombat</strong>), TT Games (<strong>LEGO</strong>), Portkey Games, and Avalanche Studios (Harry Potter), along with WB's studios in Boston, Montréal, New York, and San Francisco.</p>
<p>It's a huge deal that Netflix expect to take around 12-18 months, but that's if it goes through. We know how long <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/its-over-microsoft-has-officially-acquired-activision-blizzard">other huge acquisitions have taken</a>. Plus regulators are more than likely to get involved. Paramount had previously attempted to purchase the studio in October, which was rejected.</p>

<p>If successful, Warner Bros. shareholders will receive $27.75 a share along with stock in Netflix and the company expects to make savings of around $2-$3 billion by the third year.</p>
<p>The deal could have a huge impact on these studios, and is yet another example of consolidation in the video game industry at a time when layoffs, game studio sales, and closures are rampant.</p>
<p>In fact, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">reports emerged</a> that Netflix was selling Spry Fox, developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cozy_grove">Cozy Grove</a>, back to the owners.</p>

		<p>It’s pretty much time to wrap up the year and put a bow on it, in terms of big game releases. There’s still a whole host of ports and remasters to come, and the odd indie delight, like Skate Story or Terminator 2D: No Fate, but I think we can all shift focus to awards season and gearing up for Christmas.</p>
<p>But this week did see that one last big first party game, and I got all ‘roided up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review/">its review</a>. Metroided up on Prime, that is. With the game, not the fad energy drink, to be clear. I rather enjoyed Samus’ return, and I’m already contemplating doing a second run through!</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been playing Death Howl for a review that you can expect next week, and also got to share <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/02/outward-2-preview/">his thoughts about Outward 2</a> – “I learned very quickly the world is an unforgiving place. I died so many times!”</p>
<p>While he meant to continue playing Ghost of Yotei, <strong>Ade</strong> just couldn’t keep himself away from Darktide. “It’s just such a fun game, and the fact that you can easily find time to fit a twenty minute mission into a day makes it ideal for when there’s not a lot of free time for gaming.”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> did manage to spend some time in Yotei, though only to cross off a few bounties, before playing something much more chilled with Wingspan, the charming card game about collecting birds that he’d heard good things about.</p>

<p>It’s mainly been Halls of Torment, Lego Horizon, and Where Winds Meet for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, while <strong>Steve</strong> has (as usual) distracted himself from the horrors of the real world with the horrors of digital world, “with the retro-futuristic terrors of Routine and the insomniac delights of Sleep Awake.”</p>
<p>When he hasn’t been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s-wi-fi-7-tri-band-router-review/">fiddling around with Wi-Fi 7 routers</a>, <strong>Dom</strong> has played the chaotic physics-based co-op adventure of Cloudheim, and sunk back into Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">the impressive Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>.</p>
<p>And whaddya know? Bungie managed to lure <strong>Tuffcub</strong> back to Destiny 2 with their Star Wars crossover event. Look out for some thoughts on this a little later today!</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/neath-has-been-revealed-as-the-next-game-by-the-rogue-legacy-creators/</link>

		<p>Cellar Door Games, the studio behind Rogue Legacy and Rogue Legacy 2, has announced its next project, and it is a roguelite tactical RPG called Neath. It is set in a world where the Gods must be obeyed even as they change the rules, while players must lead a group of adventurers through an inverted tower while dealing with monsters and the whims of Fate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neath - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GQppoeUo8-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Central to Neath is the lesson that teams need to work together. A main example is the locking system where party members freeze in fear when targeted by an enemy, and the only way to break this is for other members to draw the attention of the foe. As Neath is a roguelike, no run will be exactly the same but you can use resources to build up the town of Shale. Doing so will allow access to different skills that will make runs more manageable and ascendance through the tower more likely. Runs will also have special event encounters that can change up the way things work, as the gods look to keep changing the rules.</p>
<p>No release date has been given for Neath yet, but a demo is expected in 2026. Neath has been confirmed for PC only.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate 2 Launched, Flopped, Unlaunched, Relaunched, And Renamed All In The Same Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-arena-shooter-beta-1047-games-2000650903</link>
            <guid>1374316</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Splitgate 2</i>, the “what-if-<i>Halo</i>-but-also-<i>Portal</i>” shooter, had <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-maga-refunds-reboot-beta-season-3-servers-1851786742">a rocky launch</a> this year following a controversial Summer Game Fest appearance and aggressive monetization practices. But the game is hoping to open a new chapter with players after it went <i>back</i> into beta status in July 2025, after launching just a month prior. It’s marking that new chapter with a name change. The game will now be known as <i>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</i>. A promotional video describes it as being rebuilt “from the ground up.”</p> <p>He’s changed, babe. For real this time.</p> <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">a video posted</a> to the official <i>Splitgate</i> YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), 1047 Games’ design director Josh Watson describes the game as a tribute to classic arena shooters such as <i>Unreal</i>, <i>Quake</i>, and of course, <i>Halo</i>. To that end, <i>Splitgate </i>has ejected factions and unique abilities to hopefully lock into that old-school arena style gameplay, just with fancy portals. The full experience is expected to launch for free on December 17, 2025. Check out the gameplay <a href="https://youtu.be/hrcUZ_F7vX8">here</a>:</p>

   <p><i>Splitgate</i> managed to really step in it this summer after director Ian Proulx took to the Summer Game Fest stage in 2025 to deliver <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">an obtuse rant about the state of modern shooters</a>, all while sporting a “Make FPS Great Again” hat. As if that wasn’t enough, <i>Splitgate 2</i> featured many uncomfortable trappings of modern shooters: aggressive microtransactions and costly cosmetic bundles. And for a game that promised to return to a classic style of shooter gameplay, the inclusion of a battle royale mode was odd.</p>

 <p>As such, the release of the sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">didn’t go over well with fans</a>. In response, 1047 Games pulled its shooter back into an indefinite beta status to rework the experience five months ago. Whether it will be enough to smooth things over with folks remains to be seen.</p> <p><i>Splitgate</i> impressed early on in 2019 with its fusion of classic arena shooter gameplay with portal shenanigans. They could be prone to gimmicky plays, but tossing portals into the mess of traditional arena-shooter action often proved to be a nice change of pace. Let’s see if its second emergence from beta and the new name will be enough for the sequel to make waves again.</p>

            <guid>1374313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="138" data-end="634">Still got a “dumb” TV lacking all the smart features we’ve seen become a standard over the last decade? No need to upgrade just yet if it’s still working fine. Maybe just need to bring it into the modern age with the help of a Roku. They’re budget-friendly and simple to set up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">And conveniently enough, Amazon is currently offering the Roku 4K HDR Streambar SE and Wireless Bass Bundle at a 35% discount.</a> It’s usually listed at $230, but for a short period you can grab it for only $150—meaning you keep an extra $80 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="636" data-end="1261">Whether you’re trying to start streaming on a non-smart TV or you’re just not a fan of your smart TV’s clunky interface (looking at you, LG), plugging a Roku into one of your free HDMI ports is can make for a better experience. You’ll be able to access all the apps you rely on to stay caught up with new releases. Every Roku streaming device includes Bluetooth support and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting it smoothly integrate into your broader smart home setup. Its remote also features a built-in voice assistant, making it simple to search for whatever content you’re looking for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1263" data-end="1704">And speaking of the remote, it’s rechargeable, so you no longer need to stock AAAs. The backlit buttons make it easy to navigate in dim lighting without the usual fumbling around. Of course, you can also just say “Hey Roku” and control everything via voice commands instead. If the remote ever goes missing, Roku even provides a lost-remote finder. Though, it’s probably slipped somewhere between your couch cushions. Maybe just check there.</p>
<p data-start="1706" data-end="2210">The home screen is completely customizable, allowing you to keep your preferred streaming apps front and center. An interesting bonus—Roku actually has its own original programming. Alongside the apps you already subscribe to like Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Max, you can switch over to enjoy Roku’s free original series such as <em>Dinner Budget Showdown</em>, <em>Celebrity Family Food Battle</em>, <em>Martha Cooks</em>, and <em>Emeril Cooks</em>. I promise, there’s more than only cooking shows. I just have food on the mind.</p>


<h2>Better Sound</h2>
<p>This holiday season bundle isn’t the standard Roku streamer. This is a multimedia player and speaker in one. This Roku soundbar sits under your TV so you can enjoy upgraded sound with all your shows and movies. The soundbar—or Streambar, rather—is both your sound output and the source of the Roku interface itself. It just needs to plug into your TV over HDMI and you’re set.</p>
<p>The bundle is also throwing in the Roku Wireless Bass. This can kick your already great sound up a notch by bringing a subwoofer into the mix.</p>
<p>Go grab some snacks and let everyone know that the next movie night will be happening in your living room—<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/">thanks to the Roku Streambar SE and Wireless Bass bundle, now available for just $150</a>. I’d recommend putting that $70 you’re saving toward a popcorn machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6241/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

              <p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was an actor that everyone would immediately recognize, but perhaps many would struggle to name. Known best for his portrayal of Shang Tsung in 1995’s ridiculous <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, and then for voicing the character in the games since 2013, Tagawa had multiple other defining roles across an extraordinary career. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> he died on December 4, following complications from a stroke.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of a more iconic role than Shang Tsung, the evil sorcerer in Paul W.S. Anderson’s hokey and adored 1995 adaptation of the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> video game series, as well as 2013’s web series <em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy</em>&nbsp;(then once more in 2015’s <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Mortal_Kombat_X:_Generations_(lost_production_material_for_unreleased_web_series_based_on_game_franchise;_2015)">abandoned promotional web series, <em>Mortal Kombat X: Generations</em></a>). But Tagawa had broad range, known more recently for his leading role as the noble and conflicted Nobusuke Tagomi in Amazon’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, as well as roles as diverse as Krull in Tim Burton’s <em>Planet of the Apes</em>, Hiroki Watanabe in&nbsp;<em>Lost in Space</em>, and multiple guest roles on a number of popular TV series. He also displayed a splendid lack of brand loyalty when he appeared in 2010’s atrocious movie version of <em>Tekken</em>! (As well as its straight-to-video sequel.)</p>

 <p>Tagawa was also a voice actor, portraying Valco in <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, The Swordmaker in Netflix’s animation <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, and Alrich Wren in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Rebels</em>, among many others. He was a contributor to video game voice roles, too, again most notably reprising his role as Shang Tsung in various <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games, including&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11</em> and its various DLCs. The actor is also heard in <em>World of Warcraft: Legion</em>, and 2003’s <em>Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu</em> as the eponymous criminal. Oh, and rather brilliantly, he appeared in the extraordinary mess of 1997’s FMV game <em>Soldier Boyz</em>, a game that claimed to be co-directed by Darren Aronofsky, given the footage was lifted from an HBO TV show.</p> <p>The Toyko-born actor trained in martial arts as a child, before studying karate at university. His first movie appearance was Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning <em>The Last Emperor </em>in 1987, before going on to appear in 150 other roles. Tagawa died on Thursday morning, surrounded by his family, aged 75. RIP.</p>
