			<p>The Ubisoft of the early 2000s was a very different beast to the company that we know today. Before the open world sprawls of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, it was Rayman, Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia that were the company’s cornerstone releases. And then there was Beyond Good &amp; Evil. A critical darling that struggled commercially, it built up a committed fanbase that elevated the game to a cult level. The 2011 remaster for PS3 and Xbox 360 performed much better, such that both the 2008 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/12/beyond-good-evil-2-returns-as-a-prequel-adventure/">2017 sequel announcements</a> sparked momentary optimism, but the long stretches of silence have turned Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s development into a meme and the series has felt doomed to become a relic of the past. Still, a 20th anniversary is as good a reason as any to dust off an old classic and revisit the good old days.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaU4tMuvvdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Returning to the world of Hillys inevitable involves a huge amount of nostalgia for me, so wrapped up is this game in my memories of venturing out into the world after graduating from university. Lifting the rose tinted specs to appreciate the game in a wider context, it’s clear that Ubisoft has kept the remaster pretty restrained, while making some necessary quality of life improvements to aid a modern audience and adding a few extras and bonuses for the longtime fans.</p>


<p>Assuming you are not familiar with the game already, BG&amp;E tells the story of a young reporter, Jade, and her attempts to unravel the mysteries and conspiracies behind a sinister alien invasion of her adopted home planet. This planet is populated by a mixture of species from standard homo sapiens to humanoid sharks. Jade herself lives on a lighthouse island and acts as a foster mother of sorts to a group of orphaned children alongside her Uncle Pey’j, who just happens to be a boar. When Jade’s home is threatened and attacked by aliens, she is caught up in an adventure that traverses the land eventually takes her to the moon.</p>


<p>BG&amp;E was always a game that benefited from its striking visual design rather than extreme graphical fidelity. I was worried that the remaster would lose this aesthetic and go for a more heavy-handed approach, but fortunately it has retained the feel and style of the game and produced an update that looks like my memories of the game, rather than the somewhat more jagged reality of 2003. Similarly, the soundtrack has been refreshed and rerecorded by a live orchestra, but not changed. The result is stunning and I’ll be adding it to my gaming playlist.</p>
<p>In terms of genre, BG&amp;E takes inspiration from action adventures such as classic Zelda and incorporates vehicle traversal and stealth sections into the mix. It feels like a game that predicts the open world sprawl of so many contemporary titles, but reins in the scale to still feel intimate and meaningful. The map is relatively small, but it’s packed with secrets and hidden areas that really reward exploration for completionists.</p>

<p>The controls have been remapped to be more in keeping with modern titles and I found them to be smooth and responsive on PS5. Perhaps the most important improvement is the introduction of an invert option for all game modes, solving one of the biggest complaints the original game faced. The fantastic ring-based keyboard is retained and still feels head and shoulders above all other methods of text entry on controller.</p>
<p>Dating from the golden age of single player adventures, BG&amp;E contains no multiplayer, no online components, and no DLC or microtransactions – all aspects that doubtless feed into my nostalgia for it and its era. That isn’t to say that the 20th anniversary version is barebones though, as there is a wealth of behind the scenes content for fans to look through and enjoy. Seeing the changes the game underwent through development is a real bonus for fans and the connections to the long-delayed sequel can perhaps be better understood this way.</p>

<p>Playing through the game now also benefits from the inclusion of auto-saves to avoid frustration at some of the more awkward stealth sections – perhaps the one part of the game that has not aged well. At the other end of the spectrum, truly committed players can try out the speedrun mode that completely disables saves and turns the game into a permadeath challenge. There are also the expected range of achievements that reward exploration and completionists. Most of these are fairly standard, but the ones for finishing a speedrun and for beating the final boss without losing health promise to be major obstacles for those wanting a complete set.</p>
<p>Perhaps most exciting of all, however, is a new treasure hunt questline that seeks to bridge the gap between this game and the characters and setting of the sequel. This is probably the clearest indication that that game is still in development somewhere within Ubisoft, with a touching tribute to its Creative Director, Emile Morel, being included here too.</p>

		Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing everyone's favorite gun-toting heroine Lara Croft into the fold as a survivor.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/lara-croft-in-dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> says, Lara is "among gaming's most formidable - and honorable - heroes", and she's also apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bafta-poll-most-iconic-gaming-character">the most iconic gaming character of all time</a>, so her introduction to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>does make some sense, although&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;isn't much of a horror franchise.</p>
<p>There's no corresponding killer for Lara, so don't expect Jacqueline Natla or Himiko to show up and give her a hard time. That said, she does arrive with three perks to help her stand out from the survivor crowd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=N2EwvaJz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=JdBIh9uU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lara Croft has officially joined the cast of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Lara's first perk, Finesse, gives her 20% faster vaults while she's healthy, while her second, Hardened, reveals the Killer's aura for a few seconds instead of Lara screaming. It's activated after unlocking a chest and either cleansing or blessing a totem.</p>
<p>Finally, the Specialist perk gives Lara one token every time she opens or rummages through a chest, up to a maximum of three. When performing a great skill check on generators, the maximum required generator progress is reduced according to the number of tokens Lara's amassed.</p>
<p>Lara Croft is just one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">many characters</a> arriving in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of its apparent ongoing mission to become the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>of horror games. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' Vecna</a>, Remedy's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover">hapless writer hero Alan Wake</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky">Chucky from the&nbsp;<em>Child's Play&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>.</p>

For Blokus, a game that has players arranging <em>Tetris</em>-like shapes on a game board, each color will be distinguished by a unique three-dimensional pattern added to the plastic tiles. For games like Tumblin’ Monkeys and KerPlunk, the colors of the sticks that players are tasked with removing will be distinguished with added 3D details.</p><div><figcaption><em>Games that Mattel has made colorblind accessible will be distinguished with a new badge on the packaging.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Mattel</cite></p></div><p>The initiative will also expand to the mobile app versions of the company’s card games, with updates to <em>Uno! Mobile</em>, <em>Phase 10 Mobile</em>, and <em>Skip-Bo Mobile</em> that will add the colorblind identification symbols.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Mattel has made efforts to expand the accessibility of some of its more popular games. In 2019, the toy maker <a href="https://nfb.org/about-us/press-room/uno-introduces-first-official-braille-deck">partnered with the National Federation of the Blind</a> to create a version of <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/uno-braille-gmm14">Uno featuring braille</a> on every card, allowing blind and low-vision players to participate. </p><p>This also isn’t the first time Mattel has made efforts to accommodate the 350 million people around the world affected by colorblindness. In 2017, the company <a href="https://www.coloradd.net/en/news/mattel-launches-special-edition-uno-coloradd-in-a-metal-box/">partnered with ColorADD</a>, an organization that developed a unique code, based on five symbols, that allows those with color blindness to identify and distinguish the colors of an object. That partnership resulted in a <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/uno-coloradd-hpp33">version of Uno featuring the ColorADD code</a> added to the cards, but Mattel’s latest efforts take a more streamlined approach that’s easier for players of all ages to quickly learn.</p><p><a href="https://shop.mattel.com/pages/mattel-games-colorblind-accessibility-faqs">According to Mattel</a>, its first colorblind accessible games were released in March, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Games-Adult-Players-Amazon-Exclusive/dp/B0B64G9ZSG/ref=sr_1_14?tag=theverge02-20">Uno Flex</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Games-Family-Players-Exclusive/dp/B09C916VRP/ref=sr_1_13?tag=theverge02-20">Uno All Wild</a>, ​​<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Games-Minimalista-Collectible-Featuring/dp/B089DR3N7S/ref=sr_1_15?tag=theverge02-20">Uno Minimalista</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Storage-Updated-Camping-Exclusive/dp/B0BBSTJ1VH/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20">Dos</a>, and the updated versions of Blokus, Phase 10, Skip-Bo, and KerPlunk will also be available by year’s end.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="wJBdHr"><strong>Soft caps</strong> are the key to understanding stats and rune allocation in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. If you know the soft cap breakpoints, you’ll be able to get the optimal return from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-best-early-mid-late-game-locations">runes</a> you’ve spent — as opposed to receiving diminishing returns from excessive stats. </p>
<p id="Z7k6B8">If that sounds a bit complex, don’t worry; in this guide, we’ll explain everything there is to know about soft caps in <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p>

<hr id="54QmGo">

<p id="2ZZ8zy">If you’re no stranger to the Lands Between and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtre</em></a>e’s Realm of Shadow, you probably know the drill: defeat enemies, receive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22951034/rune-farming-best-early-mid-late-game-locations">runes</a>, and use the runes to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22949097/stats-attributes-character-vigor-mind-endurance-strength-dexterity-intelligence-faith-arcane">level your stats</a> at a Site of Grace. Each individual stat can be leveled from 1 to 99, with 99 being the “<strong>hard cap</strong>” — the limit. </p>
<p id="zweWFS">Beware, however, that there’s a difference between leveling a stat from level 30 to level 31 or from level 50 to level 51, <strong>as you’ll receive less benefits once you’ve crossed a certain threshold</strong>. This threshold is called a “soft cap” or a “breakpoint” in <em>Elden Ring</em>. When you start leveling a stat, the returns will initially remain the same or even improve with every new level, but after reaching a certain breakpoint, the stat will be soft-capped and the returns will become less and less.</p>

<p id="Wi0mNF">For example:</p>
<ul>
<li id="1mwx78">If you level your Vigor from level 3 to level 4, your HP will increase from 312 to 322.</li>
<li id="rp7vNK">If you level your Vigor from level 4 to level 5, your HP increases from 322 to 334.</li>
</ul>
<p id="dke8Qw">As you can see, the returns per level have improved; instead of 10 HP points, you received 12 HP points the second time. These <strong>growing returns will reach their peak</strong> when leveling Vigor from level 39 to level 40, with a whopping 48 HP points gained (from 1402 HP to 1450 HP). </p>
<p id="tPrVUL">If you continue to level your Vigor from level 40 to level 41, though, your HP will improve from 1450 to 1476; a return of 26 HP points. It’s <strong>still an improvement, but obviously not nearly as grea</strong>t as the previous 48 HP points. From this point onwards, the amount of HP gained from additional Vigor levels will steadily decline. <strong>Level 40 is therefore called the first soft cap for Vigor.</strong></p>
<p id="mENB0a">And that’s not all; <strong>every </strong><em><strong>Elden Ring</strong></em><strong> stat has at least two soft cap points,</strong> up to as many as four. For Vigor, the amount of HP gained from higher levels will drop significantly after level 60, as you will only get between 3 and 6 HP points per level afterwards. Level 60 is therefore named the <strong>second soft cap</strong> for this stat.</p>

<p id="9MraIj">The existence of soft caps in <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t mean you should stop leveling a stat after reaching such a breakpoint, but it does mean that you need to <strong>mind your stat point allocation</strong>. Leveling Vigor from 40 to 60 can still be a great choice, but you might need to prioritize other stats before you do so, as the returns from those upgrades may be far greater.

<ul>
<li id="q2yH8X">
<strong>Level 1-40</strong>: growing returns, up to +48 HP per level.</li>
<li id="qOxbQ3">
<strong>Level 41-60</strong>: diminishing returns, between 27 and 13 HP per level.</li>
<li id="rTlYj9">
<strong>Level 61-99</strong>: diminishing returns, between 6 and 3 HP per level.</li>
</ul>
<p id="IpPECm">Vigor improves <strong>HP, fire resistance, and immunity</strong>. As mentioned in the example above, Vigor has growing returns before reaching the first soft cap at level 40. This is amazing, as it means you’ll receive more and more HP with every level up until that point. Sadly, the drop-off is rather steep, going from 48 HP to 26 HP points — and even down to only 6 per level after the second soft cap at level 60. </p>
<p id="wkrsr4">Having a high HP is extremely useful for almost any <em>Elden Ring</em> build - it’s hard enough to stay alive without giving every enemy the possibility to one-shot you. We therefore <strong>recommend to hit the first soft cap of level 40</strong>, and continue to level 60 if your playstyle needs it (frontline melee builds, for example). Anything above level 60 is a waste of runes.</p>

<li id="8gCjIx">

<li id="xKsWwZ">
<strong>Focus</strong>: only starts to improve from Mind level 31 onwards, with soft cap at level 40.</li>
</ul>
<p id="lQ3KoU">Mind improves your <strong>FP and Focus</strong>. Focus is a nice defensive stat to have (protects against sleep and madness) but FP, also known as “mana,” is far more important as it’s needed to cast spells. With that in mind, you really only need as much Mind as you require FP to cast your magic. With a fully upgraded Flask of Cerulean Tears, you can restore 220 FP — one full FP bar at Mind level 38. Therefore, <strong>Mind at +38 is therefore the “sweet spot”</strong> before hitting the FP soft cap at level 50 and Focus soft cap at level 40.</p>

<p id="PDk1rt">Endurance improves <strong>stamina, maximum equipment load </strong>(allowing you to stay within the “medium load” range while wearing heavier armor, for example), and <strong>robustness </strong>(resistance to bleed and frostbite). The amount of stamina you’ll need depends on how much you consume; if you’re using a melee build, you’ll typically want at least +34 Endurance, a stamina and equipment load sweet spot that also offers some robustness.</p>
<p id="i4YAKy">If you’re an endgame player with lots of runes to spend, <strong>you may keep going until the equipment load soft cap at level 60</strong>, as this allows you to equip far better armor sets while remaining in a below-heavy load range. </p>

<p id="ncXn9G">At the start of your Elden Ring game, should you decide to wield a strength- or dexterity-scaling weapon,<strong> try to reach soft cap level 20 as soon as possible</strong>. Go up to 60 as you progress further (don’t forget your Vigor, Endurance, and Mind soft caps), but there’s no need to proceed past the level 80 soft cap.</p>

<p id="TdkeEl">The defensive attributes (vitality, magic defense, etc.) hit a very steep drop-off after level 60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-point-hope<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has released a new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's got enough to offer that the devs have officially made it the 0.10 update, meaning future roadmap updates will have higher version numbers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Kinetic released the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2024">roadmap</a>, in which the studio promised additions like new tasks, new player models, and new ghost models, plus lots more.</p>
<p>While this update doesn't contain much of what was promised for version 0.10, it does bring an entirely new map in the form of Point Hope, a vertiginous lighthouse with ten floors and twelve rooms to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-point-hope.jpg?itok=auWMUHKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-point-hope.jpg?itok=kD_GFRp_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Abandon Hope, all ye who enter here.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to unlock Point Hope at level 15, and thanks to some of the new changes to leveling this update brings, it shouldn't take you quite as long to get there.</p>
<p>Kinetic Games says it's lowered the required experience to reach level 100 "by around 10%", which should speed up the leveling experience. Additionally, you can now "level up to 9999 for each prestige" if you really, really love playing&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes have also been implemented, including technical optimizations that have "drastically improved the performance of several areas of the game", according to Kinetic.</p>
<p>You can read the full&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update 0.10 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/6215608421522854557" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>. Sadly, they don't make any mention of the long-delayed&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">console release</a>, but hopefully, we'll hear more about that sooner rather than later.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-dark-room.jpg?itok=3yh_lrVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-update-0.10-eventide-dark-room.jpg?itok=Z4ereUXc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playing&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>should feel a little better now thanks to Kinetic's technical improvements.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've yet to play&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which you and your buddies must explore haunted locations to gather evidence of ghostly activity.</p>
<p>Different ghosts require different equipment and strategies to track, so you'll have to alter your approach to make sure that you deal with whatever spirit is haunting the place you're investigating.</p>
<p><i>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</i>is available right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on PC via Steam</a>. It's also due to come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S at some point in the future.</p>

It's hotter than the inside of a horse here, so what better time to play an RPG about driving randomly through the desert in search of enlightenment. The RPG in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/broke-signal-badlands-a-world-of-desert-adventure">Broke Signal Badlands: A World of Desert Adventure</a>, and yes, that's a very upbeat subtitle for a game in which you can perish after getting your hand stuck in the door of an abandoned Fonts Museum, or while yanking cacti out of your foot. There are gunfights, too, with dice serving as bullets, but so far, I've only managed to die of pathetic human error and clumsiness. Consider me unenlightened, but enthused.

</p><!--more-->
<p>
Coming this year to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2432490/Broke_Signal_Badlands_A_World_of_Desert_Adventure/">Steam</a> with an older version already for sale on <a href="https://forwardinstinct.itch.io/broke-signal-badlands">Itch</a>, Broke Signal Badlands casts you as a line man (a telephone repair engineer, I think) who has abruptly decided to steal the company truck and go on a mystical roadtrip. Over the course of the subsequent hour or two, you'll WASDrive across a tilted 2D map painted in glaring shades of hazard yellow and Vimto purple, investigating landmarks such as forgotten mines and dealing with fleeting pop-up events such as hitchhikers.  
</p>
<p>
I'm not entirely sure which technology or medium or period the visual direction is channelling, but I like it. The map reminds me of both the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>'s overworld and the pulp comic stylings of last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fabulous-fear-machine-out-today-is-a-strategy-game-of-engrossing-evil">The Fabulous Fear Machine</a>. The HUD is interestingly abrasive: scratchy illustrations of events and quests materialise slowly from the bottom up, as though slithering out of the belly of a fax machine. This invests the accompanying text with a peculiar mixture of suspense and irritation, as you either tap your cactus-punctured foot waiting for the full scene to reveal itself, or shrink back at the thought of seeing the horrors described. The writing itself is as sparing and dry as the bones of a cable repairguy who went looking for himself on the barrens and suffered a mortal wound while tidying up tumbleweeds after dark (yes, this is one of the quests).

The weird western premise and vignette-driven structure obviously recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a>, but rather than being an experimental episodic adventure like KRZ, Broke Signal Badlands is a shortform pen-and-paper-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-horror">World Of Horror</a>. Again, the game is a search for enlightenment. How does one become enlightened? By Mad Maxing your stats, apparently. 
</p>
<p>
There are three - Guile, which describes how crafty and underhand you are, Strength, which describes how likely you are to fall and hurt yourself while scaling a mesa, and Attunement, which describes both your level of empathy and your sensitivity to stuff like passing UFOs. Each point you plunk into a stat gives you a die you can roll to complete or fail an event or quest. You'll need plenty of Guile, for example, if you're going to sneak into the back of that Fonts Museum. More Guile than me, anyway. 

</p><p>If you can level each stat all the way to six, you'll pierce the veil of ignorance and emerge from the badlands a more complete and rounded being. More likely, you will injure yourself repeatedly, with each injury reducing the number of quest actions you can perform each day. When that number falls to zero, it's game over.
</p>
<p>
Broke Signal Badlands is apparently based on real-life trips to the Mojave - some of the illustrations look like they were created using photographs from those journeys. I do have to ask whether developers Forward Instinct found enlightenment in the process, and whether this game is the result? If you like the atmosphere, but would prefer to play something with more lavish writing, I recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24185081/still-wakes-the-deep-review-narrative-platform-horror-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2u5cg9">The best horror games stick around long after credits have rolled, squirming in and tickling the back of your brain. <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> has stuck around in my noggin, provoking questions that I know I will never have the answers to. There are plenty of familiar elements in <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, and in less deft hands, it could come off as derivative or redundant. But the atmosphere, the characters, and the restraint exercised by developer The Chinese Room all come together to create a special four-hour experience that I can’t forget.</p>
<p id="OmTf8b"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> takes place on a Scottish oil rig in 1975. The protagonist, Caz McLeary, is dodging an assault charge by taking a position here. The game gives us a little bit of exposition via a letter from Caz’s wife, and then we’re off to meet some of Caz’s co-workers. There’s a whole crew of boisterous blue-collar workers here, but we only get a couple of quick conversations with most of them before shit hits the fan. The voice acting is superb and very Scottish, so it might be worth turning on subtitles (if you aren’t familiar with Scottish accents) to catch the intricacies of these conversations.</p>
<p id="QjXWa1">A greedy manager insists the oil rig drill down into something that feels “off” to the workers, and something ancient awakens. Some crew members die, others are injured, and some are trapped under wreckage or in a diving bell. The early game is a very industrial horror experience, and Caz’s electrical skills are essential to try and salvage things. It’s chaotic, but the crew guesses at first that it was an air pocket or some similar, mundane catastrophe. They’ll soon be proven wrong, but the crew’s initial reactions set a tone of fear very well.</p>

<p id="7TRu7N">From here, Caz is tasked with trying to help as many of his colleagues survive as possible. One early scene that sticks with me is of a rookie diver, stuck in a diving bell, screaming incoherently. His partner, distraught with grief and guilt, is trying to get him out. At the time, this seemed like the morally right thing to do, but those primal howls gave me the unsettling feeling that freeing him was the wrong choice. Sure enough, whatever emerged from the drill began writhing and climbing up the oil rig, claiming and corrupting any workers it could reach.</p>
<p id="vCHHFK">This is where <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> really shines. My corrupted co-workers become my biggest obstacle. They’re out of their minds with pain and fear, and their bipedal forms twist and contort into something unrecognizable. The monster designs are deeply unnerving, and The Chinese Room did a fantastic job at allowing them to pursue and menace Caz while never giving the player a full look at them. Being around the supernatural creature from the depths or the monsters it produces obscures Caz’s vision; a colorful oil-like substance dances around the colors of his perception. </p>
<p id="SOdJ7s">It would have been very easy for <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> to overplay its hand and end up being lost in the crowded genre of hallway horror. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: A troubled man flees the consequences of his actions, only to find himself ensnared in a supernatural nightmare. Add in memories of a sobbing spouse and a protagonist desperate for immersion, and you’ve got a narrative going. But The Chinese Room strategically refuses to provide the player with all the answers they want. </p>
<p id="VkdQuJ">It’s easy to imagine a weaker presentation, where Caz stumbles across diary entries explaining a cult taking root on the oil rig, rituals to summon the antagonistic force, and definitive answers to his (and the player’s) questions. These scenes might be sprinkled with gratuitous gore and cheap jump scares. Instead, I walked away from <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> feeling like I had experienced a carefully honed story. I still have questions, but that feels intentional; it’s proof that in horror, less is more.</p>

<p id="YYMWlm">It’s a shame that the platforming doesn’t hit quite as well. It’s very functional; Caz has to make his way through the oil rig, trying to find a way out. The creature from the depths is growing up over the rig, breaking the structure down. Once safe corridors flood, Caz must swim through dark and claustrophobic hallways. Former colleagues stalk critical junctures, weeping and wailing. But my journey feels like I’m on rails; unlike a <em>Dead Space</em> or a <em>Prey</em> where I’m exploring a structure, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> feels like it’s guiding me along a predetermined course. </p>
<p id="VoXaR3">There are points where this works really well, as you can watch the supernatural organism grow and evolve its way across the oil rig. Other times, that structure feels clumsy. For instance, stumbling across a platforming sequence where each jump is marked by a big splash of yellow paint feels a bit awkward. One thing I enjoyed is Caz’s blunt reaction to each subsequent bit of bad news he gets; after being ordered around by NPCs in a hundred other horror games, I appreciated Caz calling his colleagues out for bossing him around. It’s also deeply relatable to watch Caz nearly fall to his death and curse up a storm.</p>
<p id="V401dv">Indeed, I started <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> hating Caz, but by the end of the game, he had won me over. The finale was a complete gut punch, and for the first time in a while, I sobbed over the conclusion of a story. It’s not necessarily a bummer ending — I’ll spare you the details — but it is an emotional one. Each individual element of <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> has been done before, but they’re brought together marvelously here, and the end result is a horror classic.</p>

The modifier asks players to keep a cool head as their own pixelated one continues to grow proportional to their success.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In Bit Party, players will be dropped into Bitvela, a play on the Favela map <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-mw3-2023-multiplayer-maps-1851017710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-mw3-2023-multiplayer-maps-1851017710">brought over from 2009’s <em>Modern Warfare 2</em></a></span>, not the more recent map of the same name in 2022’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-ii-infinity-ward-campaign-1849695247&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-ii-infinity-ward-campaign-1849695247"><em>Modern Warfare II</em></a></span>.

Anyways, Bitvela looks like a really cute and pixelated version of the classic map, and as usual it will be able to host 12 players in variants of popular 6v6 modes.<br></p><p>Though the majority of the player models will remain semi-realistic, their heads will balloon in size as you rack up kills and only dying will reset it. There are only three possible head sizes: small, medium, and large. Think of this fun little playlist as <em>MW3</em>’s own neat homage to Big Head mode in <em>Goldeneye</em>, where you could input a cheat code to make your friends’ heads bigger, making it that much simpler to line up headshots.</p><p>Even though having a big head makes you an easier target, the benefit to slaying so hard that it <em>literally </em>goes to your head is that the size of your dome also amplifies your score. For example, holding an objective in Hardpoint with a bigger head will net you and your team more points. The same goes for capturing a flag in Domination, collecting a tag in Kill Confirmed, or just getting a kill in good ol’ fashioned Team Deathmatch.</p><p>Bit Party will be available to play in <em>MW3</em> beginning June 26, and will run until July 3 as part of a “Retro Warfare” event. Additionally, players will be able to shop for a pack on <em>MW3</em>’s store called the 8-Bit Bliz bundle, which will give them access to pixelated versions of the protagonists of the <em>Modern Warfare </em>series, including Ghost, Soap MacTavish, Captain Price, and Farah.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a single session of <em>SUPERVIVE</em>, you’ll team-up in groups of four and dive into a huge world in the sky with the goal of being the last team standing as the playspace grows smaller due to an encroaching, deadly storm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To win, your squad will drop on a vast, expansive map to kill monsters and pursue a wide variety of map objectives. Doing so will grant you levels, rare powers, and equipment, which you can use to your advantage in defeating enemy teams. Along the way, you’ll find unique powers and equipment, dream up crazy strategies, and outplay other teams in sprawling, free-flowing combat.</p><p><em>SUPERVIVE</em> is a <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play game</a> with cosmetic unlocks – no pay-for-power, ever.</p><p><strong>Combat Meets Chaos</strong></p><p>Key differences between <em>SUPERVIVE</em> and other games include:</p><ul><li>A wide array of open-ended powers, items, abilities, and environmental interactions—bounce off jumpads, build walls, glide through abysses, punch trees, ride trains, combine powers in unique ways, and more.</li><li>Gliding and aerial combat with instant-KO “spikes” when players are hit over the abyss mid-glide.</li><li>Low time-to-kill, allowing for highly-lethal, 1vN playmaking.</li><li>In <em>SUPERVIVE</em>, massive comebacks are a more regular occurrence, ensuring players aren’t out until they’re out thanks to innovative comeback mechanics like:<ul><li>You can revive downed teammates while still fighting.</li><li>“Deathbox resurrections” where you can bring back a dead ally using their deathbox (as long as nobody interrupts you)</li><li>A full-squad revive at resurrection beacons (no tags needed).</li><li>The “most wanted” power-up that revives your squad if you stay alive long enough (or get enough kills) while your position is broadcast to the lobby.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Main mode: SQUADS—10 teams per lobby, 40 players total, four players per squad. About 20 minutes per game session.<ul><li><em>SUPERVIVE</em> also supports duos and four-versus-four deathmatch.</li></ul></li><li>Over 15 hunters are currently available during playtests with more in development for launch.<ul><li>Each hunter has a primary fire, four abilities, and a passive.</li><li>Hunters are unlocked through regular play—as players progress in their Hunter’s Journey pass, they’ll be able to select any hunter to unlock at various level milestones.</li><li>There are no hard “roles” in <em>SUPERVIVE</em> or mandated team compositions—all hunters can output reasonable amounts of damage and can win a one-versus-one with some skill.</li><li>There are three major hunter archetypes:<ul><li>Fighters, who tend to deal the most damage with low-to-medium utility.</li><li>Protectors, who deal moderate damage with supportive team abilities.</li><li>Controllers, who deal moderate damage and have disruptive, space-controlling abilities.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Map-based objectives and storm shifts.<ul><li>Every game has a chance to roll a random “storm shift” that mutates that game’s variables—like bullet trains, which places three high-speed, lethal trains on the map; nomadic storm, which moves the available playspace across large distances; and more!</li><li>Unique, biome-specific monsters and bosses spawn at different times throughout the match, each dropping a unique power or game-changing ability.</li><li>Explore a wide and varied world in the sky where many different biomes have been stitched together.</li></ul></li><li>Over 50 unique powers.<ul><li><em>SUPERVIVE</em> features a wide array of unique, open-ended powers ranging from passive benefits, to special abilities, to placeable fortifications, to combat-augmenting skills.

If you missed out on it when it first launched in 2022 and you're considering picking it up, you might feel apprehensive when you hear how tough the game is. Fret not, because in a new video, GameSpot is ready to show you how you can survive and thrive in The Lands Between.</p><p>First off, if there's one golden rule with Elden Ring and other Souls-like games, it's that you need to be patient. Be Patient Pete--be the Tarnished warrior who approaches every battle with a wary nature and who waits for an opening. As GameSpot's Devante Chisolm explains in the video, treat every encounter like a conversation: one where you can respond to a question with a perfectly timed attack when you have the chance to speak.</p>

Did we mention that you should over-level your character? You should definitely over-level your character: we cannot stress this enough.</p><p>Throw in some helpful gameplay assists like summoning friends or AI companions to give you a helping hand, and you'll be on the right path toward becoming an Elden Lord.</p><p>"With all that Shadow of the Erdtree offers to accompany what exists in the Lands Between, the story of Elden Ring now feels complete and its world whole, and it's a staggering achievement," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-machine-god-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fatshark has released the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Secrets of the Machine God update, and it contains a new mission for you to try out, plus new weapons and more.</p>
<p>The patch is live on Steam right now, and it'll be going live on other platforms "shortly" as well, so if you're playing on Xbox or you've got the game via the Microsoft Store, you shouldn't have too much longer to wait.</p>
<p>First up, the new Clandestium Gloriana mission (which Fatshark says was "previously mentioned as Atelium Foundryplex Omega V"), will take you into the depths of Tertium to reawaken an Adeptus Mechanicus facility. It's got a new "variable end event" to increase its replayability as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-new-mission.jpg?itok=_JXKU1aF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-new-mission.jpg?itok=yXE23V70 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This land serves as the backdrop for your new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>mission.</figcaption></figure><p>New weapons have also been added, with the Ogryn class getting its first two-handed weapon in the form of the Pickaxe. If you've ever felt like Ogryn melee attacks lack a certain heft, this weapon should do a lot to redress the balance.</p>
<p>Naturally, a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks have also been implemented. Several missions have been changed according to community feedback, and&nbsp;<em>Darktide</em>'s crosshair has undergone some changes to make it a more reliable tool as well.</p>
<p>That's all in addition to a ton of bug fixes and minor improvements that work diligently behind the scenes to (hopefully) make your&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>experience a more pleasant one, if such a thing can be said about this miserable hive city.</p>

<p>If you want to know everything that's new, you can take a look at the full&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>Secrets of the Machine God patch notes <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-1/96131" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>....and <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-2/96132" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here as well</a>. The notes were so long Fatshark split them into two posts, so I hope you like reading patch notes!</p>
<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>is a co-op first-person shooter set in the hive city of Tertium. Newly conscripted to the Emperor's Inquisition, you must assist Explicator Zola in containing the forces of Nurgle and ensuring they don't overrun Tertium.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, the game is quite similar to Fatshark's&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>, although the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>setting means everything's much less fantasy-inflected and much more grungy and industrial. If you loved&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>, though, you'll almost certainly like this too, and there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40000-darktide-2024-plans">lots more on the way</a> for the devoted faithful.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/warhammer-40-000-darktide/9nt3wc6rkbvq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S.

Robert House runs New Vegas in the game and is an integral part of any story in the setting. Since New Vegas appears in the final shot of season one, we know the second season will feature the iconic location in a big way. If Mr. House is involved, it means that the show will likely need to make one particular ending of <em>New Vegas </em>canon: the one in which the player sides with Mr. House in the conflict for the Hoover Dam. </p><figure id="" data-id="2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-recommend-id="image://2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-recommend-id="image://2e030e9ee75574b0a3971b39eba50b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr. House appears on a computer screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This ending establishes that Mr. House will continue to rule New Vegas in the years following the game, with the city described as a despotic vision of pre-war glory in which the streets are “orderly, efficient, cold.” However, if the show takes the same storytelling approach in season two as it did in season one, there is another option. Mr. House could appear in flashbacks, further revealing the machinations that led to the apocalypse in the first place. If the show takes the flashback route, it could feature Mr. House while continuing to play coy about the specific events of<em> New Vegas</em> to keep each player’s ending equally canonical, for now.</p><p>Whichever ending of the game the show chooses to go with (if any in particular), it still won’t answer the question of what happened to New Vegas after the game. The show takes place 15 years after <em>New Vegas</em>,<em> </em>and in that glimpse we get of it in the first season’s final moments, we see it as a ruined city bereft of its signature lights and splendor. What happened in those 15 years remains a mystery the second season will likely dig into, and whether in flashback or not, Mr. House is sure to play a big role in revealing the answers.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Still Hasn’t Officially Complained About Palworld]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-complaints-palworld/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-still-hasn%E2%80%99t-officially-complained-about-palworld.910782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-complaints-palworld/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In January, shortly after the sensational ‘Palworld’ was released, Nintendo announced that it was investigating the game for any signs of plagiarism. Later, Nintendo’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said that the company would ‘take appropriate action’ if their IP had been infringed upon. Nintendo has long been known as a stalwart company where copyright issues are concerned, but it has been confirmed that six months after Palworld was released, Nintendo has yet to make an official complaint.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perhaps-it-s-fine">Perhaps It’s Fine</h2>



<p>In many ways, Palworld was a flash in the pan. It blew up overnight, with millions of players flooding the game, which was being presented online as ‘Pokémon with guns’. In Palworld, players are charged with exploring a vast open world, collecting and upgrading ‘Pals’, crafting items, and building bases. It was a monumental success when it was released in January, soaring up the charts and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-growth-emergency-epic-meeting/">prompting emergency meetings at Epic</a> Games because it threatened to bring down the servers hosting it.</p>



<p>Despite Nintendo’s claims that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-pokemon-company-says-they-will-investigate-palworld-for-ip-infringement/">launching an investigation into Palworl</a>d just days after it blew up, it seems as though nothing has come of it. Pocket Pair, the developer behind Palworld, confirmed recently that no complaints have been received and no legal proceedings have been kicked off, suggesting that all is well between Nintendo and Palworld.</p>



<p>Speaking to Game File’s Stephen Totilo, Takuro Mizobe, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the head at Pocket Pair, said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn’t say anything to us. Of course I love Pokémon and respect it. I grew up with it, in my generation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Palworld has suffered a fall from grace since dominating the charts six months ago. It hit an all-time peak player count of around 2.1 million users on Steam but now averages around 18,000 peak players per month. It has also dropped off entirely on streaming and content platforms – but that’s the lifecycle of most games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1805617622970511468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> via X, the Dead by Daylight account officially confirmed that Lara Croft will be the next survivor and release on July 16, 2024.</p>



<p>The developers elaborated on Croft’s perks in the full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1do8343/810_ptb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PTB patch notes</a> released today. Lara Croft will include the Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist perks.</p>



<p>Finesse will make Croft’s fast vaults 20 percent faster. Hardened can allow Croft to reveal the Killer’s aura instead of screaming. Finally, the Specialist perk introduces a token system that can lower the maximum required generator progress.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s patch notes also detail some balancing changes coming to The Knight, The Singularity, maps, and more. Fortunately, that does include some extensive bug fixes.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive revealed it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">face new layoffs</a> affecting nearly 100 employees. However, Dead by Daylight continues to expand with impressive new updates and collaborations.</p>



<p>In May, fans also got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at Project T</a>, which is set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>Besides Dead by Daylight, Lara Croft has previously seen other collaborations such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-pack-cod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Tomb Raider pack</a> from last year. </p>



<p>More recently, there’s a lot of traction around Tomb Raider adaptations. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-live-action-show-coming-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action series</a> is coming to Amazon Prime Video. Animated series The Legend of Lara Croft is also coming in October 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hayley-atwell-lara-croft-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featuring Hayley Atwell</a> as Croft.</p>

It boasts super-fast charging capabilities, a robust battery capacity, and a sleek design. It's our favourite pick for portable gaming, and well worth it at such a discounted price.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-game-that-lets-you-fight-back-against-the-indignity-of-waiting.910749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/while-waiting-demo-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Owning my own business and working from home, I don’t actually wait for stuff that much anymore. If anything, I have the opposite problem: tasks and responsibilities are constantly flying at my head while I shout, “Aah, wait a minute!” at them. But if you have not made the same terrible life choices as me, the demo of upcoming game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2449160/While_Waiting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>While Waiting</em></a> might be your speed.</p><p><em>While Waiting</em>’s demo has been out since <a href="https://x.com/PlayOptillusion/status/1764783113815671252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March</a>, but I checked it out after seeing some folks talking about it online over the weekend. The demo features 10 levels from developer Optillusion’s full game, where you control a character across various ages as they wait for stuff: a bus to come, the rain to stop, someone to get out of the bathroom, their boss to finish a presentation. You have the option to simply wait, standing there until the thing you want to happen happens, but you can also get up to trouble, guided by vague in-game achievements like “percussive maintenance” and “Watch out!”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="While Waiting - Official Trailer | Day of the Devs 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBsxzuL4YK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One of my favorite levels was about waiting for a game to download. You’re faced with a familiar on-screen screen of several simultaneous downloads, and an indicator that your internet connection is low. The downloads crawl along, so I did all the things I do when faced with that situation on Steam: I turned the internet on and off, paused and un-paused the downloads, and set them up to download one after the other before getting impatient and trying to force them all to happen at the same time again. Like every level in <em>While Waiting</em>, there’s stuff you can do that isn’t immediately clear, which I discovered by clicking around. It was such a familiar, relatable situation, and such a unique feeling to have the feelings I usually have <em>around</em> a game inside a game instead.</p><p>Another favorite level for me, for personal reasons, was waiting for the bathroom. I’m a trans man, so I am intimately familiar with the uncomfortable situation of waiting for a bathroom stall when there’s a free urinal. In real life, I pass this time by doing the “you go ahead” gesture at men, combined with a choreography I’ve perfected of trying to pretend I have to poop (justifying my wait for the stall) but not so urgently that I cause a scene. In <em>While Waiting</em>, I wandered over to the urinal, only to be confronted by the fact that–just like in real life–I couldn’t figure out if I could pee in it.&nbsp;(In the game, it appears your character actually has to poop, as suggested by an uncomfortably hilarious image of an upturned can of Spam.)</p><p>Given how many possible tasks each level presents, it seems like the game <em>wants </em>you to mess around while waiting, but I like the idea of just standing there, even if I never actually succeeded at doing it. In real life, you don’t–or, I hope you don’t–respond to the interminable wait for your luggage on the airport carousel by hurling everyone’s bags around the terminal. Some of the secrets you can get up to strain the bounds of credulity, painting <em>While Waiting</em>’s world as much wackier than its initial mundane premise might suggest. I am dour and un-fun, so I’d love to see more levels where you’re actually constrained by reality, though I understand what a bad game that would make when stretched over hours. But despite my desire for everything to be tediously literal, it was delightful to discover little secrets in <em>While Waiting</em>’s scenes, creating interesting events and revelling in throwing destructive tantrums.</p><p>There’s a bit of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> in <em>While Waiting</em>’s self-created chaos and mysterious tasks, but without the excuse of “hey, I’m a goose!”, you really just get to let your worst impulses come out. There’s no release date yet, but <em>While Waiting</em> promises over 100 levels to cause a scene in when we get a full release.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game, which was originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">during this February's Nintendo Partner Direct</a>, will arrive across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 24th, publisher THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/THQNordic/status/1805596997509886405" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier today</a>.</p>

<p><em>Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>will tell the same story as the original game, one in which Mickey must delve into Wasteland, a world filled with forgotten Disney characters, and decide its fate with the aid of his magical brush.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight.910722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
As if she hasn't been through enough already, Tomb Raider's Lara Croft is now set to join Dead by Daylight as a Survivor.
</p>
<p>
"Lara Croft has survived expeditions few would dare attempt, locked eyes with death and lived to tell the tale... Now, she must face yet again a dark adventure shrouded in Fog," the Dead by Daylight team teased, noting that while this may be her first foray into horror, she has certainly seen things many of us can only imagine during her own global escapades. Remember when she took down a tyrannosaurus rex?!
</p>
<p>
The Lara heading to Dead by Daylight is from the Survivor trilogy, specifically the 2013 reboot (see image above). However, while she has her jade necklace and tank top, she does not have her bow and pistols, meaning she will have to find other ways to survive the fog.

</figure>
<p>
"Her unwavering tenacity, wealth of survival expertise, and bravery are represented with three unique Perks to balance the scales in her favour," the Dead by Daylight team explains.
</p>
<p>
Lara is set to make her Dead by Daylight debut next month, on 16th July, as part of the game's Tomb Raider chapter. Ahead of that date, those wanting to put Lara through her paces sooner rather than later can take part in the limited-time public test-build on Steam, which is available now.
</p>
<p>
"With her experiences and skill set, Lara Croft perfectly embodies the characteristics needed to survive in The Fog and is right at home in the world of Dead by Daylight alongside other iconic characters. Though she may be well-prepared for the Trials ahead, in the Entity's twisted world, the future is never promised," Behaviour close.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the news, the Dead by Daylight team recently announced a new 2v8 mode, as well as an update on spin-off titles, and a tease of a new Castlevania chapter coming later this year.

			<p>Epic Mickey Rebrushed, the remake of the first entry in the series created by Deux Ex series creator <a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-warren-spector-system-shock-3-deus-ex-trilogy/">Warren Spector</a>'s Junction Point Studio, is launching this September on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The game developed by Purple Lamp will be released on September 24th, 2024, on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, as announced by a new trailer shared today. The game's standard and Collector's Editions are also available for pre-order now, the latter giving access to a special costume pack as well as 24-hour early access to the game, which won't be available on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed | Release Date Reveal | Collector’s Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3UPoTalv4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Epic Mickey Rebrushed reimagines the original game developed by Junction Point Studio with improved visuals and some tweaks, such as new movement skills like dash, ground pound, and sprinting. Despite the gameplay tweaks, the game promises to be a faithful remake that will see players accompany Mickey Mouse in the Wasteland, a realm of forgotten Disney characters like Oswald the Rabbit, Walt Disney's first unlucky creation who was eventually replaced by Mickey Mouse in 1928.</p>
<p>Epic Mickey Rebrushed launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on September 23rd, 2024.</p>
