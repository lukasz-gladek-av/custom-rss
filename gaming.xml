                <p>According to former Insomniac Games boss Ted Price, a Resistance 4 game was pitched but ultimately wasn't made.</p><p>In an interview with Kinda Funny Games, Ted Price, said, "We did pitch that one. It was a wonderful concept, and in terms of timing and market opportunity, it didn't work out." When asked whether Resistance 3's poor sales at the time impacted the decision to move on from the series, Price didn't answer directly.</p><p>"Resistance 3 was intended to end that chapter of the Resistance franchise," he explained. "With the way we ended with [protagonist] Capelli and closed a lot of loops on various smaller story items...we wanted to do that so we could have more options in the future, whether we would go ahead with more Resistance games or taking another turn."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKbHKCUkpw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1537">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZWKbHKCUkpw?start=1537" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Resistance 3 was released in 2011 for PS3. While Insomniac was an independent studio back then, the Resistance franchise was published by Sony. A PlayStation Vita entry was released in 2012 called Resistance: Burning Skies, but it was created by another developer, Nihilistic, (now known as nStigate Games).</p><p>Back in 2012, Price confirmed that Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-drops-resistance/1100-6349237/" data-ref-id="1100-6349237">wouldn't be making any more Resistance games</a>, but later said in 2013 that the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-seriously-considered-resistance-4/1100-6408517/" data-ref-id="1100-6408517">"seriously considered" a fourth entry</a>. However, Insomniac during that time chose to create the third-person co-op shooter game Fuse instead in order to avoid franchise fatigue. Insomniac Games went on to create Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016), Marvel's Spider-Man, Sunset Overdrive, and Song of the Deep before being acquired by Sony in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-founder-ted-price-is-retiring-after-30-years/1100-6528948/" data-ref-id="1100-6528948">Price recently retired from Insomniac Games</a> and the studio is currently working on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Wolverine game</a>.</p>

<p>Insomniac Games wanted to develop Resistance 4, but PlayStation turned it down. That’s according to soon-to-be president of Insomniac Games Ted Price.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw?t=1311s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Price was asked about a favorite game of his that was pitched but never greenlit.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll share one,” Price said after a brief pause. “Resistance 4.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and, it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out. But it was the result of a lot of Insomniac  team members being passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p>



<p>Price said that they spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where the series could go in the future.</p>



<p>“Personally, I love this franchise,” he said.  “I was fortunate enough to be creative director on the first two Resistances. And I will remember many, many moments—good and bad—when it comes to development that taught us all a lot about how we can elevate ourselves under some pretty difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Resistance, which first debuted with 2006’s Resistance: Fall of Man, hasn’t seen a mainline game since 2011’s Resistance 3. Price said that there’s no answer to the question of if the studio will ever develop another Resistance game, but it’s something he hopes will happen in the future.</p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto parent company Take-Two's stock price is soaring this week following the company's recent earnings report on February 6. Why is the share value surging? It's often hard to know what makes a stock price move in the market, but there are some strong signals for what might be causing it this time.</p><p>Starting with the numbers, Take-Two's stock price is currently trading above $210 per share, which is about $35 higher than where it was when markets closed on Thursday. That's a gigantic gain for a single day, and it helped propel Take-Two's stock price to the highest value in the company's history.</p><p>Take-Two's previous high of around $210 per share came in 2021 during the pandemic, when many entertainment companies saw huge gains due to stay-at-home orders. For a historical comparison, when GTA V was released in September 2013, Take-Two stock was trading at around $17 per share. Anyone who bought back then, or earlier, and still holds Take-Two shares today is doing quite well.</p><p>On Thursday, Take-Two made a couple major announcements. First, management confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> remains <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">on track for release in Fall 2025, though management said it cannot rule out a delay later on</a>. Perhaps the more notable piece of news that may have contributed to the stock-price growth was that Take-Two significantly beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, which investors are seemingly responding positively to.</p><p>Take-Two lost 71 cents per share during the latest quarter for a total net loss of $125.2 million for the period. But <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/take-two-interactive-software-inc-q3-loss-increases-beats-estimates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">analysts expected Take-Two to lose about 90 cents per share</a>, meaning Take-Two's performance, while in the red overall for the period, was far better than what many expected. This, coupled with the announcement that GTA 6 remains on track, may help explain why Take-Two stock is exploding. As always, though, there are never any clear answers for why a stock moves in a particular direction.</p><p>Every Rockstar Games release in the past decade has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed beyond its originally announced date</a>, so some continue to believe GTA 6 might get pushed to 2026. Some are theorizing that GTA 6 was actually already delayed but only internally given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reports of missed deadlines</a>. Only time will tell if GTA 6 makes it out on time, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p><p>Reacting to the long wait for GTA 6, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs." He added: "I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p>GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold. One company believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">GTA VI can sell 40 million units and drive $3 billion in revenue during its first year alone.</a></p><p>Whenever it's ready, GTA VI will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Take-Two is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-hints-at-plans-to-support-switch-2/1100-6529308/" data-ref-id="1100-6529308">likely to bring some of its games to Switch 2</a>, but no one should expect GTA 6 to be among them.</p>

"After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development and the invaluable community feedback from <a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-demo-released-for-pc-and-xbox-series-sx/">various playtests</a>, operation 'Release' is a go for Commandos: Origins."</p>

<p>There is going to be a major update coming to Balatro sometime in the future. What’s included in that update, however, is currently unknown, and that’s by design.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NTUwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYwMzA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJVTUxEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.vnpDPy2eO2srUo1cO71bFTutl-JvFojih-o2zs4niu4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Balatro developer LocalThunk gave a small update on the next update he’s working on. </p>







<p>The update, which he calls a “1.1” update for the game will include new Jokers along with various other features. LocalThunk didn’t want to get into exactly what those features will be because of potential constraints that would put on him such as the ability to “pivot if something new doesn’t work.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s healthier for the game that I keep my cards close to my chest, then give you the best version of whatever this new content update is,” he said.</p>



<h6 id="h-listen-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">LISTEN: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Despite not wanting to give anything away, he did reveal two changes that will come with the update. The first is a change to the “blue stake” modifier while the second is a change to the Matador Joker—Earn $8 if played hand triggers the Boss Blind ability. As far as what those changes will involve, that wasn’t said. Details on that, along with everything else players can expect, will come closer to its release.</p>



<p>The update is expected to arrive sometime this year.</p>

          <p>There are only two licensed professional sports games included in Wikipedia's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_notable_for_negative_reception">List of video games notable for negative reception</a>." Do not be fooled, however: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_2K20">WWE 2K20</a></em> and <em>eFootball 2022</em> are just the outliers, arriving so poorly crafted as to cause notable outcry and an actual change to development plans. Most licensed professional sports games come out yearly, whether fully baked, notably improved, or not, and fans who have few other options to play with their favorite intellectual property learn to make do with them.</p>
<p>Not so with fans of <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/">Football Manager</a>, a series that can be traced back in some form to 1992 that has released a game almost every year, minus one ownership shift in the early 2000s. Sports Interactive, the company behind the franchise, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">released a statement on Thursday</a> (in British time) that says that "following extensive internal discussions and careful consideration," <em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is canceled. The game was "too far away from the standards you deserve," so they are focusing on the 2026 version.</p>
<h2>Trying not to make “the same bloody game every year”</h2>

<p><em>Football Manager 2025&nbsp;</em>was already delayed twice and is now quite late—as we are now midway into the European football (or what Americans call soccer) season. The game was intended to be a major overhaul.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson, head of developer Sports Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last fall</a> that the 2025 version was the "first chapter in the new book of <em>Football Manager.</em>" Lots of existing modes would be tossed out, including international management and "touchline shouts," or phrases you can yell or calmly administer to your team during the matches you don't actually control. The game was moving from a proprietary engine to Unity. The team reimagined and redesigned more than 500 screens full of data. Perhaps most importantly, 2025 was the year the franchise landed the official license for the Premier League.</p>
<p>With all that, there have been a lot of scope changes. "I've de-scoped something today," Jacobson told Eurogamer in September, "that at the time of the [June] dev blog was still in scope. And we re-scoped something last week, and we up-scoped something last week—it's a very fluid process!" The reason for these changes? "It's our ambition," Jacobson said then. "I know that some people will find that difficult to believe because, 'Oh, they only work on iterations, they're making the same bloody game every year.'"</p>

This character requires a lot of patience to determine the opportune moment to score an elimination. Mastering the timing for her combos and the additional mechanics of her attacks, some of which are barely mentioned in-game, are crucial for improving your performance. </p><h2 id="h162092"><a id=""></a>Poke for damage and then pick off supports</h2><p>When it comes to damage and movement, Psylocke excels in controlled bursts. While she can be helpful fighting side-by-side with her teammates, she’s best played like an Assassin who prioritizes Strategists. You want to be as annoying as possible by diverting enemy attention and taking out their support heroes.</p><p>That doesn’t mean sneaking behind enemy lines is always the best strategy. You should mix up your approach now and then, but getting chased down by a more mobile hero sucks. A common tactic instead is to focus on flanking and attacking just off the side. Keep poking for damage and then dive in quickly to take out their Strategists or anyone with low health. Don’t forget that her primary fire (Psionic Crossbow) and Wing Shurikens have some major falloff damage, so you shouldn’t be attacking from too long of a distance.</p><h2 id="h162093"><a id=""></a>Maximize your burst damage with animation cancel combos</h2><p>Quite a few heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> can boost their damage output through animation canceling. The idea is to <strong>use melee or other abilities to interrupt the recovery animations of an attack</strong>, allowing you to quickly chain together moves for a quick burst damage combo. A common case for Psylocke is using melee or another ability right after throwing out her dual-projectile primary fire will skip the brief recovery period. Coming to grips with these is vital to utilizing her full potential.</p><p>The optimal combo starters for mid-range and close-range can be seen below. Keep in mind that they will do more damage by landing critical hits or ending with a Psi-Blade Dash, but you’ll still be putting the hurt on your opponents either way. If your targets are especially low on health, you can also animation-cancel after the first set of her primary fire projectiles for potentially quicker burst damage.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mid-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Wing Shurikens &gt; Psionic Crossbow</li><li>Close-range Combo: Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee &gt; Psionic Crossbow &gt; Melee</li></ul><h2 id="h162094"><a id=""></a>Always have an escape plan, and at least one dash</h2><p>Smart positioning and critical hits will help you against a single enemy, but the tables can quickly turn when fighting multiple opponents or even a full-health Vanguard. Psylocke’s kit isn’t quite meant for those situations, which is why you must always have an escape route in mind.</p><p>Most players will try to save one of their Psi-Blade Dashes just in case things go south. I’ve found that using it to dash upwards to higher ground is a great way to escape from most situations. Her Psychic Stealth invisibility can also help you out here, although it will be interrupted if you use another ability while invisible. The rewinding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-team-up-attacks-season-zero-1851733122">team-up ability</a></span> she gains from Magik is another great tool for retreating, but I don’t recommend activating it when surrounded due to the vulnerable state you’re in during the startup.</p><h2 id="h162095"><a id=""></a>Make use of Psylocke’s attacks’ special mechanics</h2><figure id="" data-id="0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-recommend-id="image://0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-recommend-id="image://0d45743ae18a831b762b0beea78aacbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Abilities tab for Psylocke’s Hero Profile, highlighting her Psionic Crossbow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aside from her Ultimate, each of Psylocke’s attacks has an additional mechanic that helps her sustainability. Only two of these are mentioned in-game, and none of them provide the associated stats either. Here are the interesting mechanics to keep note of:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Psylocke’s primary fire, Psionic Crossbow, reduces the cooldown of her abilities by 0.25 seconds for each bolt projectile that hits an enemy. She shoots out a pair of four bolts each time you cast the attack. Landing all eight bolts will shorten any cooldowns by a much-appreciated two seconds.</li><li>Bonus health will be granted for every Wing Shuriken projectile that hits an enemy. She’ll throw out five at a time, with each one granting 10 bonus health. Any enemy hit during the recall will also count for a maximum of 75 bonus health. Just remember that similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>, this extra bit of HP isn’t permanent and will start depleting after a few seconds.</li><li>Any thrown-out Wing Shurikens will be recalled after using a Psi-Blade Dash. They’ll travel to her location at the start of the dash and then return to her current location. This is kind of an awkward mechanic, but the benefit is that it’ll add to the damage from your dash.</li></ul><h2 id="h162096"><a id=""></a>Getting one or two kills with your Ultimate is ideal</h2><p>Dance of the Butterfly is a flashy AOE (area-of-effect) Ultimate that sees Psylocke slash away at enemies with 150-damage attacks. It initially sounds like the perfect team-killing Ult (Ultimate), but she can only perform up to eight attacks and the target of each is selected at random, with priority given to those who have been hit fewer times. That means your chances of getting a kill are lower with each additional target.</p><p>Instead of aiming for the entire team to earn a solo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace kill</a></span>, use it against groups of two or three. I’d only suggest the latter amount if they’re all close together and relatively squishy with health. You’re more likely to land at least one kill here along with leaving some enemies weak, but fingers crossed you can eliminate more with the ultimate. Strategists should naturally be the priority for this, while any Vanguards should be avoided unless their health is low.</p><hr><p>Psylocke is a fun character to play, as long as you don’t assume she handles like any other <em>Marvel Rivals</em> Duelist. Focus on dishing out burst damage and you’ll be the bane of the enemy team’s existence.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a VALORANT match with massive qualifying implications, Vitality star Nikita “Derke” Sirmitev busted out the silliest play in the playbook. And somehow, the gamble worked, leaving his opponents embarrassed, and insuring a spot for his own team at the first Masters event of the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-derke-does-the-unthinkable">Derke Does The Unthinkable </h2>



<p>In the upper bracket final of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-lands-sony-inzone-sponsorship-for-next-2-seasons-of-vct-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VCT EMEA Kickoff</a>, Vitality and Team Heretics went haed-to-head for one of two spots at Masters Bangkok. To beat Heretics, a two-time grand finalist at international events in 2024, Vitality would need to play with the utmost confidence. </p>



<p>Derke, the former star of Fnatic who switched to Vitality this past offseason, certainly didn’t lack confidence when he caught Heretics off guard with the fake Yoru clone. Typically, when a Yoru player uses their Fakeout ability, they send a clone forward that will hit enemies that shoot it with a blinding flash. So normally, enemy players just ignore the clone walking completely straight forward. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207_CrackyStormyCrocodilePJSalt-cXdQVUEvEo_Sf8k7_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Unfortunately for Heretics, it wasn’t Derke’s clone that walked onto the site, it was Derke pretending to be his clone. To make matters worse, Heretics’ Ričardas “Boo” Lukaševičius teleported right next to Derke before he turned, gifting him an additional kill. It’s a play that VALORANT fans have sometimes seen during streams and maybe in their own ranked games, but never on a pro stage as big as this one. The play also gifted Vitality a bonus round win, taking a third straight round to start Haven despite not completely buying. Vitality ended up winning Haven, and then owned Heretics’ own map pick of Abyss to claim the series, and the Masters spot, in dominant fashion.</p>

It was taken from <em>La Isla se las Tentaciones</em>, a show that mirrors the original 2003 <em>Temptation Island </em>premise of bringing couples to an erotic getaway where their romantic bonds and libidinal restraint are put under extreme duress as other beautiful participants attempt to seduce them.

Beta players are already grappling with its big challenge, a fearsome new foe called Arkveld, and its eliciting both excitement and dread.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is the new flagship monster for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. This means the beast is the cover star for the game, and stands to play a significant role in the course of players' journeys through Wilds. As part of the new beta test, courageous hunters can try to tackle a hunt for the Chained Arkveld, with a 20-minute time limit and five "faint" limit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ambitious players are discovering, this new monster packs a punch. Arkveld is a massive winged beast, with electric chains stretching out from each of its arms. It can swing them around and make the air crackle with its thunderous attacks, and it's surprisingly fast, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Experienced hunters <a href="https://x.com/KeithMontalbo/status/1887717556322279689" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>are still finding themselves sent back in a cart</u></a> by its powerful moves. It's an impressive display of the new technology, as Arkveld uses its whips to move around, throw out long-reaching attacks, and generally be a menace. One attack in particular has Monster Hunter players in the beta thunderstruck, as it grabs the hunter and roars at them before slamming them down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arkveld is even causing some mild unexpected havoc. I really <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijrpqw/arkveld_is_having_none_of_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>enjoyed this video one player on the r/MHWilds subreddit captured</u></a>, of Arkveld interrupting their meal. The wilds are no place to go for lunch, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a visually impressive fight and an incredibly dangerous monster. While the difficulty might be worrisome for some, the Monster Hunter faithful seem spurred on by it. Taking down big, dangerous monsters is the name of the game after all, and seeing Wilds' flagship monster be so fearsome and iconic in equal measure is a reaffirming notion. Additionally, the "Chained" note — plus Arkveld's flagship status — has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfj5yn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players considering</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1ijmvau/comment/mbfh1n4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether there could be</a> an even more terrifying "Unchained" version down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2</u></a> runs February 6 through 9, and then returns February 13 through 16.

      A short emulator-aided demonstration of how the broken ladder glitch works (not shown: the dozens of frame-perfect inputs needed to pull it off).

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<h2>Better to be lucky than to be good</h2>
<p>While players have <a href="https://donkeykongforum.net/index.php?topic=325.0">theorized about using the broken ladder glitch to pass the kill screen for years</a>, it initially seemed like even this glitched shortcut was too slow for the short kill screen timer. Yet when Kosmic attempted the same trick using his own emulator-assisted setup recently, he says he was able to complete the level on his first try. What gives?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Kosmic was the beneficiary of some significant luck. Basically, every time Donkey Kong throws a barrel, there is a 1 in 32 chance that he will wait an extra half second or so before throwing the next barrel (this random process <a href="https://pastebin.com/WXR5iy7t">is explained in way too much detail in this Pastebin</a>). Since the game's bonus timer only ticks down when Donkey Kong actually throws a barrel, the semi-rare delay can give Mario the crucial extra frames he needs to reach the top of the kill screen using the broken ladder glitch.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, this randomized barrel-throwing delay can theoretically repeat indefinitely, provided the game's randomizer picks the same lucky 1-in-32 sequence over and over again. If Donkey Kong decides to delay his barrel throw about 19 times in a row, Mario would actually be able to complete the kill screen normally, without the broken ladder glitch (and without facing many barrels, even). Of course, the chances of that happening on unmodified arcade hardware are nearly 1 in 40 octillion (1 in 32^19, to be precise), so don't count on encountering it in the wild any time soon.</p>

<p>With the ladder glitch, though, Kosmic's emulator-assisted run needed significantly less luck to pass the kill screen at 22-1. He was even able to push the game past the next four stages (including previously unseen spring and pie factory screens) to reach level 22-6.</p>
<p>Kosmic calls that stage the game's true kill screen, as there's currently no known way for Mario to remove all eight rivets quickly enough to overcome the glitch-shortened timer, even with emulator assistance. Then again, for decades, players assumed there was no way to complete level 22-1, either. Maybe someone will figure out a clever method for beating this new kill screen with 40 more years of sustained effort.</p>

                <p>Fanatical has launched a new bundle of PC games--all redeemable on Steam--in support of charity, and for just a few bucks, you can pick up dozens of wholesome titles while also supporting mental health initiatives. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fsafe-in-our-world-charity-bundle-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-new-charity-bundle-includes-27-games-for-just-15%2F1100-6529327%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Safe In Our World Charity Bundle 2025</a> is <strong>just $15 for 27 games</strong>, and amongst some all-time classics, you're also getting a few recent releases as well.</p><p>Since this is a charity bundle, a<span> portion of all bundle purchases is donated to Safe In Our World, and you</span><span> can increase your pledge beyond $15 if you feel like giving more.

            <p>
Three years after its announcement, the future of Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game is reportedly in question - with its release said to still be "years away" if it ever launches at all.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">new report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, detailing the behind-the-scenes turmoil caused by a culture of "ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time" at Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president</a> David Haddad - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision" .
</p>

Some casualties of Warner Bros.'s reported culture under Haddad are already well-documented, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. However, Bloomberg's report also highlights a number of other projects that have either failed or floundered behind closed doors.

<p>
Monolith's Wonder Woman game, for instance, has reportedly "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year, according to "people familiar with the business". Wonder Woman is said to have already cost Warner $100m and is still "years away from release", if it manages to make it to market at all - its fate, according to Bloomberg's sources, "remains in question".
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg reports Monolith had originally wanted to follow its acclaimed Middle-earth games with a new franchise experimenting with procedural storytelling. However, Warner Bros. execs are said to have pushed for the studio to incorporate one of the company's big IPs, and the resulting game "plodded along for more than three years" before its cancellation - at which point Monolith head Kevin Stephens and many directors departed. After that, remaining staff began working on Wonder Woman, initially attempting to incorporate a version of Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system before switching to a "more traditional action-adventure game".
</p>
<p>
As revealed last March, Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Montreal has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-studio-supporting-wonder-woman-game">drafted in to help Monolith get Wonder Woman over the finish line</a>. However, Bloomberg says the Montreal team was initially hoping to make a game based on comic book antihero John Constantine - hopes that were dashed when execs pushed the team toward a "more recognisable character" such as the Joker or Flash. The studio ultimately opted to make a Flash game, but the project was scrapped after Warner's 2023 Flash movie flopped at the box office - leading to the resignation of "most of" Montreal's leadership team. The studio is now said to be working on a pitch for a Game of Thrones title, as it continues to help out on Wonder Woman.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's sources say the major gaps in Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment's portfolio left by the company's string of cancellations and commercial failures during Haddad's tenure are likely to persist "for the next year or two". There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">one potential bright spot on the horizon</a>, however, with developer Rocksteady - following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">demise of its live-service-focused Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> - now said to be "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game". The project, though, is still "years away from landing".

He explains a sick irony in the fact that his decades of <em>Simpsons</em> voice acting that has been enjoyed by billions of people over the show’s illustrious 36-year run could essentially help train A.I. to replace him.</p><p>“I imagine that soon enough, artificial intelligence will be able to recreate the sounds of the more than 100 voices I created for characters on <em>The Simpsons</em> over almost four decades,” he writes. “It makes me sad to think about it. Not to mention, it seems just plain wrong to steal my likeness or sound—or anyone else’s.”</p><p>He does suggest there are aspects of voice acting that A.I. could possibly make easier. “When I know that a certain line needs a laugh, but I’m not sure how to get one, I’ll try different things. I’ll make a list of eight or nine ways to try it,” he wrote. “The A.I. model may not know what’s funny or what timing is, but it could do a million different takes. And it could be told to do them as I would — and it might be pretty convincing.”</p><p>Even with that slight concession to A.I.’s benefits, he uses his lengthy op-ed to shine light on how nuanced voice acting is, and how it won’t be easy to replicate  without humans. To him, voice acting is more than simply reading lines, it’s a marriage of someone’s voice and their acting abilities. Crying real tears to give life to a character’s sobs; running in place while recording lines for a character who’s running; stuffing a lighter in his mouth to convey the sound of a cigar-chomping character; these are all actions Azaria has implemented to make the characters we love appeal to us on a human level. </p><p>“I’d like to think that no matter how much an A.I. version of Moe or Snake or Chief Wiggum will sound like my voice, something will still be missing—the humanness. There’s so much of who I am that goes into creating a voice. How can the computer conjure all that?”</p><p>The existential threat A.I. poses to actors is why certain regulations were put in place in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sagaftra-ai-provisions-agreement-lawyer-1235869078/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective bargaining agreement</a></span> (CBA) signed after the writers and actors’ strike of 2023, making actors’ consent a necessity before digital replicas of their voice and likeness are created. Even with these safeguards, however, loopholes still exist where an A.I. model can be trained by using an actor’s performance under certain contractual clauses. </p><p>Azaria’s concern is real, and his fears could be the reality of what we hear and see on our TV screens in the future. I’m sure <em>The Simpsons </em>episode satirizing it all will be amazing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hasbro has partnered with Legendary Entertainment to create a Magic: The Gathering live-action film and TV universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/magic-the-gathering-legendary-hasbro-film-tv-universe-1236280886/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment will first work on a Magic: The Gathering film, followed by a TV series and other content. Legendary Entertainment has extensive experience in adaptations, with movies like Dune, Detective Pikachu, and more under its belt. It is also currently working on several video game adaptations, such as the Minecraft movie and Street Fighter film.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zev Foreman, Hasbro Entertainment’s Head of Film, has called the partnership with Legendary Entertainment “exciting and complementary”. As the franchise has “inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling”, Foreman believes that Magic the Gathering’s film and TV universe will be “a perfect match for Legendary’s diversified approach to marquee IP”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mary Parent, Legendary’s Chairman of Worldwide Production, stated that the company prides itself “on being thoughtful caretakers of singular, beloved IP”, and Hasbro’s highly popular trading card game matches that description. Hasbro and Legendary Entertainment wish to create a Magic: The Gathering “multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones.”</p>



<p>Magic: The Gathering is the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/magic-gathering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">world’s first trading card game</a>, released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. By February 2023, it had gathered a staggering 50 million players and generated more than $1 billion annually since 2022. Magic: The Gathering is known for being highly strategic and customisable in gameplay, which suits all types of players. The game has received decades of expansions and collaborations with franchises like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Lord of the Rings, and more. A partnership with Final Fantasy is coming this year, too.&nbsp;</p>
