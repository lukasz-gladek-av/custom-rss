            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo has announced two new supplements for their acclaimed fantasy TTRPG, Pathfinder. One continues to expand the layered and complex setting of Golarion. The other, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em>, introduces new and updated magic classes for its players.</p><p>In an official live stream, reported on by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/pathfinder-announces-two-new-rulebooks.717153/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, Paizo announced both <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> and the <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplements for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first book is a new supplement of player options. According to its store page listing, the book contains new magical options, ranging from new cantrips to reality-bending spells. Among those options are four new dedicated spellcasting classes: Magus, Necromancer, Runesmith, and Summoner.</p><p>These classes are important since three out of the four are updates from <em>Pathfinder First Edition</em>. The Runesmith can transcribe and apply magical runes and glyphs. The Summoner can summon creatures to do their bidding. The Magus is a classic GISH; a combination of strong spellcasting and martial prowess. With this new supplement, players can see how these classes work in the latest edition of the game.</p><p>In addition, <em>Pathfinder Impossible Magic</em> introduces over 200 new spells to the game, new character archetypes, and new schools of magic derived from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-impossible-lands-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Impossible Lands</a>. If you are attending GenCon this year, you can pick up a copy of this book for yourself. The store page listing has it priced at an MSRP of $29.99.</p><p>The other supplement, <em>Lost Omens: High Seas,</em> is a continuation of Paizo's in-depth setting books in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tian Xia</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a>. As the name suggests, the book will cover the open waters of the Inner Sea. This will include the failed utopian island of Hermea, Mediogati Island, the mysterious Mordant Spire, the pirate-scoured isles of the Shackles, and the dangerous underwater depths.</p><p>The <em>Lost Omens: High Seas</em> supplement releases in July. The store page price listed is an MSRP of $44.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>2025 was an odd year for me and my "best of" list. Many of the titles I thought would be absolute locks for this--like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, <em>Civilization VII</em> and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--ended up getting nowhere near it!</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions/"><u><em>Battlefield 6's</em> campaign was a disaster</u></a>, and I wasn't able to play the multiplayer at all thanks to a bug where the game told me my GPU wasn't physically connected (it, uh, was), so it's been a total write-off.<a href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5/"> <u><em>EU V </em>was fine, but as I said at the time</u></a>, it's so ambitious, and needs so much more tweaking, that it feels like a game I won't sit down with properly for another year or two.<a href="https://aftermath.site/endless-legend-2-review-impressions-early-access/"> <u><em>Endless Legend 2</em> was just a good old-fashioned disappointment</u></a>, and<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review/"> <u><em>Civ VII</em>, whew, man</u></a>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024/"><div><p>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024 - Aftermath</p><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>I know it's weird to lead a list of my games of the year by talking about games that weren't on it, but those disappointments defined my 2025 in a way, and seem to be mirroring many of the various crises the wider games industry itself has faced in 2025. Namely AAA bloat and strategic mismanagement leading to dependable sequels losing their way,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two/"> <u>before the resulting layoffs</u></a> threaten to simply make everything even worse.</p><p>In a way, then, putting this list together felt like a slight bummer; I'd come into 2025 <em>really </em>excited for a bunch of seemingly dependable heavy-hitters, all of which ended up letting me down. Thankfully, <em>Civ VII</em> sucking simply freed up more time to play other stuff, like all the games on this list, most of which I'd never even heard of until I sat down with them, but all of which ruled on their own merits, and my year was better for having played them.</p><h3 id="flotsam">FLOTSAM</h3><figure></figure><p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, Flotsam is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlook, actually feels more like the start of a new world instead. </p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/flotsam-impressions-review-city-builder/"><div><p>Flotsam Builds Some Hope At World’s End</p><p>The end of the old world is a chance for a new one</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="tavern-keeper">TAVERN KEEPER</h3><figure></figure><p>It's always fun running a pub, pubs are inherently great, but running a pub that's truly&nbsp;<em>yours</em>, right down to the designs on the cushions and the placement of the silverware, is even better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/"><div><p>Tavern Keeper: It’s Good</p><p>“But the only brew for the brave and true...comes from the [Redacted]!”</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><h3 id="town-to-city">TOWN TO CITY</h3><figure></figure><p>It gives me the systems of a city-builder but the elegance of a town-painter, the challenge of juggling morale but letting you cheese your way to improving it by drowning your residents in dogs and fancy clothing stores.

            <title><![CDATA[A Steam Sale’s Background Art Was Filled With Hidden Free Game Codes]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At any given point in time, there are at least two or three different sales happening on Steam. Most of them include some background art that you aren’t really meant to notice. But Team 17’s new sale did something I’ve not seen before. It hid free game codes in the sale artwork for those observant enough to spot them.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://go.bsky.app/redirect?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbuff.ly%2Fxu8nST3">Team 17 launched its big Hidden Treasures Sale on Steam</a>, featuring discounts on over 50 different games, ranging from recent hits like <em>Dredge</em> to older titles like <em>Golf With Friends</em> and<em> Worms Reloaded</em>. There’s some great stuff on sale from today until January 19.</p>

 <p>But the best deals were hidden in plain sight. Over on the Hidden Treasures Steam event page, you can spot a pirate-themed background filled with gold and treasure. If you scroll down and look past the game deals, <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/32941731/c454af314fa3cb448a7a4012aa50e6bf78b8c507.png">you’ll spot faint writing on what looks like parchment paper</a>. And it’s buried in these words that you’ll also notice some alphanumeric codes, which are in fact keys for different Team 17 games.</p>

 <p>Shortly after the sale went live, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcamwhbmpq2g">this neat detail was shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a>, but even by then, it seems like most of it not all of the codes had already been redeemed. And at this point, it seems all but certain that every code has been grabbed and used.</p>

 <p>Even if you didn’t get a free game, you can still take advantage of the sale. Here are some of the best deals I spotted in the Team 17 Steam sale. These offers may not be as good as free, but they still beat paying full price.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Heavenly Bodies</em> – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Hell Let Loose</em> – $21 ($60)</li> <li><em>Golf With Friends</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Killer Frequency</em> – $5 ($25)</li> <li><em>Moving Out</em> – $2.50 ($25)</li> <li><em>Conscript: Director’s Cut</em> – $8 ($24)</li> <li><em>The Escapists 2</em> – $4 ($27)</li> <li><em>Overcooked 2</em> – $1.70 ($17)</li> <li><em>Sworn</em> – $20 ($40)</li> </ul> <p>If you were one of the lucky ones to snag a code, let us know in the comments below and tell us what game you got!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is making kids’ online safety a cornerstone of her administration, and she’s eyeing a platform that has often flown under the radar: Roblox.</p><p>As progress in Congress has stagnated, states have become the primary drivers of internet reforms meant to protect kids, including age verification laws and new requirements for online platforms. Hochul announced a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/protecting-our-kids-governor-hochul-announces-nation-leading-proposals-protect-kids-online">sweeping plan</a> to expand online parental controls and age verification, which she’ll tout at her State of the State on Tuesday. It notably pulls from a piece of legislation crafted by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic meant to plug a gap in earlier state legislation in order to encompass online gaming. Gounardes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a 2024 interview when he first introduced the legislation as the New York Children’s Online Safety Act (NYCOSA) — now the Stop Online Predators Act — that the idea came from parents who wondered whether his earlier kids safety legislation would cover Roblox, the social gaming platform that is extremely popular with children.</p><p>Drawing from the bill, Hochul’s plans include expanding requirements for platforms to verify their users’ ages to include online gaming platforms like Roblox. She also wants platforms to keep kids’ accounts on the highest privacy settings by default so that they can’t be seen or contacted by unknown accounts, and to disable AI chatbot features for kids. The plan also includes requirements for parents to be able to limit financial transactions on their kids’ accounts.</p><div><p>“There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different”</p></div><p>New York state leaders don’t want Roblox, for which more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">40 percent of users are reportedly under age 13</a>, to be left out of new protections. “From toys to food to cars, we regulate all sorts of products to keep children safe. There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different,” Gounardes said in a statement ahead of the State of the State. “Online platforms like Roblox are enabling unsafe environments for children, including allowing predators to send explicit messages to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urgently need to pass crucial online safety protections to stop predators from exploiting children and create safer online environments for children to play.”</p><p>Roblox did not immediately provide comment on the State of the State proposal, but Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield told <em>The Verge</em> after Gounardes unveiled the legislation in 2024 that the company is a “COPPA compliant gaming platform that is designed for all ages,” referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). Porterfield said Roblox has “gone beyond COPPA-compliance and built safety tools and systems that address the unique needs of children and do not support photo uploads or other features specific to social media platforms.” The company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat">since rolled out</a> new requirements for users to undergo a facial scan to estimate their age in order to access its chat features.</p><div><p>States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections</p></div><p>The kids online safety proposals were the first of the State of the State plans that Hochul previewed last week, underscoring how important an issue that internet safeguards for kids has become in states like New York. States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections since the 1990s. The proposals come alongside offline actions to address kids’ mental health, including expanded mental health clinics in schools, and an advisory board that includes 11-to-17-year-olds to inform youth mental health policy. They build on earlier legislation passed in New York state, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182396/new-york-governor-social-media-law-parental-consent-algorithms">Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act</a>, which requires social media companies to obtain parental consent for using “addictive feeds” on kids.</p><p>But some of the proposals, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/859351/age-verification-app-stores">age verification</a>, come with their own risks that opponents ranging from industry players to civil liberties groups oppose on the grounds that they could require more data collection, and potentially chill adults’ speech online. The Supreme Court recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/internet-censorship/686042/supreme-court-fsc-paxton-porn-age-verification-ruling">opened the door</a> to some age verification of porn sites, breaking from earlier decisions, but age-gating platforms that host a wide variety of speech raises even thornier questions. Courts across the country have struck down a variety of laws seeking to impose age verification at the platform and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/849752/texas-app-store-accountability-act-age-verification-injunction">app store level</a>, raising questions of constitutionality under the First Amendment. But states have continued to try to enact different kinds of age verification laws nonetheless, creating the potential for a fractured landscape state to state should some courts eventually uphold them.</p><p>Still, many advocates for more online safeguards are praising Hochul’s plans. “The online games kids play and the social media platforms they use for hours and hours a day have become veritable hunting grounds for predators,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said in a statement. “Kids and teens need these new protections now more than ever.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MjI4"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lauren Feiner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/policy/860727/new-york-governor-hochul-roblox-kids-online-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>By now, I hope I’ve made it abundantly clear that I’m an anime fan <a href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires/"><u>born to slice-of-life romance</u></a>, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/solo-leveling-impressions-anime/"><u>condemned to a lifetime of battle shonen exposure.</u></a> So when I learned that a friend gifted another friend of mine a romance manga I’d only vaguely heard of over the holidays, I treated it like homework I actually wanted to do. I binged the entire thing in a week. Naturally, when the three of us finally met up this past weekend, my friend sheepishly admitted they hadn’t even cracked the spine yet. Which means the burden now falls to you, dear reader, to hear why <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> has quietly become one of my favorite recent romance reads, thanks to how effortlessly cozy it is.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://squareenixmangaandbooks.square-enix-games.com/product/9781646092864?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</u></em></a>, by mangaka <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jinushi</u></a>, is an office workspace rom-com tailor-made for anyone weak to kinda mean goth women who’d step on you and the oddly endearing charm of exhausted, gravely-voiced middle-aged men. It’s a bisexual harvest if ever there was one, and a rare adult romance with an unproblematic age gap.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woclqV1wINo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」メインキャストボイスPV"></iframe></figure><p>Like “<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-04/rockin-out-with-sumiko-arai-the-guy-she-was-interested-in-wasnt-a-guy-at-all-manga-creator/.223419?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Green Yuri</u></a>” (AKA <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><em><u>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</u></em></a>) <em>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</em>, found its <a href="https://thetv.jp/news/detail/1084476/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>humble beginnings as a manga series published on Twitter</u></a> in the wake of the pandemic before getting picked up by Square Enix as a serial. It’s not only the first serialized series from Jinushi, but it’s also one that’s got <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-09-21/smoking-behind-the-supermarket-with-you-tv-anime-reveals-main-cast/.229036?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an anime adaptation in the wings</u></a> in 2026. So allow me to yap about why the romance manga is heat so you can say “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>but I was there!</u></a>” too.</p><figure><blockquote>— TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」公式 (@yanisuu_anime) <a href="https://twitter.com/yanisuu_anime/status/1946132855618502947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>From the jump, I was immediately arrested by how <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You </em>wastes no time resonating with anyone trapped in the corporate grind, clinging to the tiny rituals that make the day-to-day survivable as the series’ thematic anchor. Be that stopping by a convenience store, catching the warm smile of a store clerk who unknowingly gave you just enough serotonin to make that bread, or just grab some smokes and take the edge off from a hard day's work.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the cadence of Sasaki’s life. Sasaki is a middle-aged, overworked salaryman who every day gets berated by his boss. The series, on the whole, strikes a chord with anyone who deals with the corporate grind and finds solace in frequenting a haunt only to be graced by the beaming smile of a store clerk that gives you a boost in happy brain chemicals to continue waking up and making that bread. Or, at least doing so until you need to grab a smoke to take the edge off. That’s the case with Sasaki, who ends each day at a convenience store not just to grab groceries, but to bask in the bright, grounding presence of a cute clerk named Yamada. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>That is, until the rhythm of his day is thrown off one night when he swings by the store late and discovers Yamada has already clocked out. Instead, he’s greeted by a leather-jacketed, pierced woman named Tayama, who casually invites him out back to share a smoke and some company. Because Sasaki is, frankly, severely face-blind in the most endearing way, he never clocks that Tayama—whom he assumes is some coworker he’s somehow overlooked for months—is actually Yamada without the uniform, <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1829923640743444748?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">customer-service smile</a>, or the practiced bubbly disposition she uses on the clock.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/LS6xTacYqF?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/LS6xTacYqF</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1977692567988060316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>What follows is a wonderfully lopsided pseudo-love triangle in which “Tayama” (and the rest of the store staff, fully aware of the comedy of errors unfolding) gently teases Sasaki for his obvious crush on her other self. Meanwhile, Sasaki, thrilled to finally have a smoking buddy, finds himself falling for the woman behind the polite platitudes. On paper, <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of wacky setup you’d only find in a gag manga or an early-aughts rom-com—the sort of <em>Miss Congeniality</em>, <em>Princess Diaries</em> bit where a change of clothes and vernacular somehow renders a person unrecognizable. And the whole Yamada/Tayama dual identity asks for a level of suspension of disbelief from the reader that practically nudges the series into sketch comedy territory. But what makes the manga sing is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/RSOrscuIFC4?list=TLPQMTIwMTIwMjY3M6WWk_hqFw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>beneath its deeply silly premise</u></a>, it harbors a romance that could only work between adults.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/7slP9xWlTC?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/7slP9xWlTC</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1897839463834976469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>A huge part of that comes down to smoking itself. As a habit, smoking is both a self-destructive vice and a symbolic pressure valve to let off some steam. But between smokers, it becomes something more intimate: a quiet ritual of shared air, time, and vulnerability so addictive that you’d jump at the offer regardless of how chilly it is outside. Simply put, it’s a sophisticated, mature mode of connection that simply doesn’t exist in garden-variety romances. For the non-smokers of the world, it’s the equivalent of loading up a YouTube video on someone else’s account or sending them a song that’s been haunting your brain—forever altering the other person’s algorithm. Folding your tiny, private time-waster into someone else’s life in a way that feels strangely tender. “Intimacy in the modern day,” as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theofficialnorthernlion/video/7575988525087214866?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7494297314892203551&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitch streamer Northernlion</u></a> puts it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>Swap out playlists for preferred cigarette brand flavors, fireside chats, and easy shared silences that stretch as long as you let them, and you get something even more specific and profound as the bedrock of a romance. It’s here that <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> takes its cozy premise and leans into how something as ordinary as sharing a smoke with a friend can spark a kind of honesty and intimacy that hits harder than an indirect kiss over a shared drink. The small rituals between Sasaki and Tayama—the teasing, the quiet moments, the unspoken warmth—never overstay their welcome. Instead, each chapter offers another faint glow of their ember‑warm yearning, slowly shifting from easygoing companionship into something unmistakably romantic.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">３すう。 <a href="https://t.co/ZJj22t03lE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/ZJj22t03lE</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1898637057540407566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The flames of that yearning are certainly aided by <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1884197016353599641?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Jinushi’s online illustrations </a>of the two fulfilling <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1983550204868710535?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">nurse‑and‑patient cosplay</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1819346049754099821?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">other cheeky fantasies</a>. But the real magic lies in the series' quieter, less showy moments of wish fulfillment, threaded through the manga. The simple, disarming intimacy of being understood. <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of romance where letting the long fuse of this oddball relationship burn at its own pace is part of the delight. After all, you can’t appreciate a cigarette if you inhale it all in one hungry pull. Beneath the disguises and crossed signals, they’re just two people who genuinely like being in each other’s orbit—and who would quietly ache at the thought of losing the small, daily comfort of talking through the weight of their days or shooting the breeze about nothing at all.&nbsp; </p>

			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">Minecraft-like game that was recently resurrected</a> by its original creator, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, and is now due to be out tomorrow on<a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/"> <strong>January 13, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has just hit another milestone in its incredible comeback story, as Collins-Laflamme announces that the development costs for <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> as it builds Hytale in early access have been fully funded for the next two years based on <strong>pre-order sales alone.</strong></p>



<p>The game isn't even out yet in early access, but the community that has built around it since work on the game first started in 2015, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/"> stayed with it after it was acquired by <strong>Riot</strong></a>, only to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">shuttered by Riot and the team disbanded</a>, and then revived within the last few months have shown that they are very excited for Hytale to finally be here.</p>



<p>"<em>Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases</em>," Collins-Laflamme wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). "<em>Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future. Thank you for all the support. <strong>Hytale is saved.</strong> We are almost home.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Minecraft-like MMO has been a long time coming, and tomorrow's early access launch not only represents a new chapter for the game and the studio but also an incredible accomplishment for the team to be able to get it out of Riot's hands and across the finish line for release.</p>



<p>Of course, a whole new challenge begins once it is live and in players' hands, but at least the team at Hypixel Studios has the chance to see if they're up for that challenge, instead of the game lying dead in a waste basket of Riot-owned IPs, left wondering if they could have ever made something truly great with Hytale.</p>

            <p>
There is a strange deliciousness in experiencing a game from a perspective that it does not otherwise allow. Sure, things don't always look right, there's just this opportunity to rethink how you view a particular world. Recently, it appears that someone playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> got to do just that, by switching it into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooting</a> mode as opposed to its usual third-person camera, all thanks to an accident.
</p>
<p>
You see, over on the game's subreddit, user Short_Satisfaction_9 (I guess Short_Satisfaction_1-8 was already taken) shared a clip of themself playing the game in first-person using console commands. There's some obvious jank in the clip, you can see through the player-character's face at points which is always yucky, as well as their arms when they're doing some shooty stuff. This, however, is not a thing you are meant to be able to do, and has already been removed by developer Embark.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q89t5e/i_tried_arc_raiders_in_first_person/">I tried arc raiders in first person</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Short_Satisfaction_9/">u/Short_Satisfaction_9</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/">ArcRaiders</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
"We have just pushed a hotfix removing the 'NewConsole' command," community manager Ossen shared in a message in the game's official Discord (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-removes-a-hidden-first-person-exploit-just-1-day-after-it-was-uncovered-this-feature-was-never-meant-to-be-player-facing/">PCGamer</a>). "This feature was never meant to be player-facing. We're continuing to investigate related reports and may take action where appropriate to protect fair play and the integrity of the game."
</p><p>
Just because it exists in one sort of functional form doesn't mean you should expect it at any point in the future, as the devs have already said that it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/dont-count-on-arc-raiders-ever-getting-a-first-person-mode-once-you-start-being-able-to-put-your-face-right-up-against-an-asset-it-kind-of-falls-apart/">extremely unlikely they'll ever add one in</a>. Still! An interesting insight into another world where it is a first-person game, but one you'll have to find an inter-dimensional portal to travel to. Good luck?

But rather than become entangled in red string as you try to pin all the available games to your enormous pinboard, we’ve inspected the selection through our microscope, whittled down the suspects, and then performed yet another detective cliche, to select the most suspicious(ly good) games for you to interrogate.</p>  <p>Investigative games have become a rather big deal in recent years, with many indie titles having broken through to the mainstream to enormous success. And, so of course, you’ve got the likes of&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Rise of the Golden Idol </em>in the sale, alongside less recent classics like <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. But you already know about all of those, so where’s the good in my suggesting those? Nope, let’s dive a little deeper with a selection of games that won’t be appearing at the top of all the store’s lists.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/"><em>The Ratline</em></a></h2>  <p>You know who was making amazing family-tree-like detective games long before&nbsp;<em>The Roottrees Are</em> <em>Dead</em>? <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/">Owlskip</a>. Titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/riley-rochelle-musical-music-pc-steam-sheinman-games-1849676247"><em>Riley &amp; Rochelle</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/07/family/">Family,</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/09/rivals/"><em>Rivals</em></a> were years ahead on the format, and definitely deserve to be discovered in light of <em>Roottrees</em>‘ breakout success. Anything else is frankly unfair. <em>The Ratline</em> is the latest from the studio, due out in March, once again asking you to piece together a mystery from an array of clues and documents. This time things are set in 1971 and have you hunt down Nazi fugitives after the murder of a priest, and who doesn’t need a little Nazi hunting just now? There’s a demo out for Detective Fest.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781420/Surradia_An_Art_Retrospective/"><em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em></a></h2>  <p>There’s also a demo for the upcoming <em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em>, a detective game about investigating the disappearance of three magical artists who vanished during World War II. That means scouring photographs, reading letters, and of course paying close attention to artworks, all found in a museum, as you try to unpick the mystery. There’s no official release date for the game yet, but the demo’s here right now.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618570/The_Detectives_Apprentice/"><em>The Detective’s Apprentice</em></a></h2>  <p>This is a tremendous trailer! You’re Cleo, working for world-renowned detective Maya Lynch, learning the ropes in this unbelievably lovely-looking game. There’s a demo out for Detective Fest, which features Cleo’s first three cases, with the full game due later.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3627210/Mansion_of_a_Million_Monsters/">Mansion of a Million Monsters</a></em></h2>  <p><em>Mansion of a Million Monsters</em> takes a decidedly different approach to the detective genre, combining its investigative ways with dungeon-crawling action. It has the vibes of one of those classic Amiga games that everyone still raves about today. The developers say they’ll hopefully have a demo up for this one in the next day or so.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060960/Sleuth_Saga_Under_Starless_Skies/"><em>Sleuth Saga: Under Starless Skies</em></a></h2>  <p>This detective sim is based on all the right names, like&nbsp;<em>Phoenix Wright</em> and&nbsp;<em><i>Danganronpa</i></em>. Set in the year 780 Quattuoris 32nd (which I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> find on my calendar), this is the tale of the daughter of investigative journalist Frederick Emery. Her father is found dead, a staged suicide, and she sets out to disprove the police’s claims. It’s to be five episodes long, with the first now playable via a free demo. Also, later this week developers Arboreal Interactive hopes to update with&nbsp;<em>another</em> free chapter, Chapter 0.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3485220/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Murder_Otaku/"><em>Murder Is Game Over: Murder Otaku</em></a></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Murder Is Game Over</em> series of pixel point-n-clickers started in 2022, and&nbsp;<em>Murder Otaku</em> is already the fourth! It came out toward the end of last year, and if you click with its tale of solving the murder of a J-pop singer at an anime convention, that means you’ve now got another three games that are sure things. You can pick up the whole lot in the Cleo’s Complete Casefile bundle, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/33733/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Cleos_Complete_Casefile/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://hitheryongames.itch.io/murder-is-game-over-cleos-complete-casefile">Itch</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/"><em>of the Devil</em></a></h2>  <p><em>of the Devil </em>is a six-part episodic detective game inspired by the likes of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>. Its first free episode was released last year, and two more paid episodes have already been released since then! The game, which features amazing art, is set in the cyberpunk future of 2086 and has you playing a criminal defense attorney. So yeah, grab the first episode for nothing, and then see if you want to pick up the next two, with releases seeming to come nice and quickly.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131660/Call_of_the_Golden_Valley/"><em>Call of the Golden Valley</em></a></h2>  <p>Australian detective sim&nbsp;<em>Call of the Golden Valley</em> came out last October and still offers a free demo. You play Danielle, an American tourist who arrives in the country to visit a friend, Marisa, only to find she’s gone missing. So you begin investigating the small town, piecing together evidence, and finding out why Golden Valley is the sight of so many disappearing hikers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919600/Paper_Perjury/"><em>Paper Perjury</em></a></h2>  <p>Another game you can play right now,&nbsp;<em>Paper Perjury</em> is a visual novel series from Paper Cat Games where new Azure City Police Department clerk Justina Smith begins investigating some peculiar crimes. Case 1 of the game is available as a free demo, and a sixth case is due to be added pretty soon.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689930/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved/"><em>Detective Instinct: Farewell, My Beloved</em></a></h2>  <p>A few of the games mentioned above were inspired to some degree by <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but few wear it on their sleeve so much as&nbsp;<em>Detective Instinct</em>. It looks like it could have come from Capcom, and this is high praise. The mystery adventure is all about trying to track down a woman who disappears from a train, only no one on board but you can remember her. It came out late last year, and is celebrating Detective Fest with a discount and a free demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Masters of Albion, the new game from long-time developer Peter Molyneux has a release date. On Monday, developer 22cans announced that the game is set to launch on April 22.</p>



<p>The game will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-masters-of-albion-is-a-reimagining">Masters of Albion Is A “Reimagining”</h2>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, Masters of Albion is a <strong>“bold reimagining of the God Game genre.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Mixing strategy with simulation, town management and tower defence, the game takes you into the rich narrative world of Albion,</strong>” the game’s description says. <strong>“Starting in the undeveloped village of Oakridge, players will step into the body of a god, controlling the town and its citizens, building a small business and completing orders for various customers.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, the game comes from Peter Molyneaux, the man credited with creating the Fable franchise, The Movies, Populous, and many more. Back when it was announced, the 66-year-old Molyneux mentioned that Masters of Albion was likely to be his last game because of his age.</p>



<p>In a release announcing the release date, Molyneux said that the new game owes a lot to his prior titles.</p>

<p><strong>“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</strong></p>

            <guid>1403773</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Six and a half years ago—after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/gamestop-calls-off-its-search-for-a-buyer-sees-a-one-day-stock-dive-of-27/">a failed corporate sale attempt</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gamestop-posts-massive-loss-as-pre-owned-game-sales-plummet/">massive financial losses</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/management-reshuffle-at-gamestop">the departure</a>/<a href="https://x.com/ModernVintageG/status/1156658352874827776/photo/1">layoff</a> of many key staff—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/why-some-of-us-will-miss-gamestop-when-its-gone/">I wrote about</a> what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/">meme stock mania</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/gamestop-stock-falls-sharply-amid-5m-share-sales-plan-sec-investigation/">helped prop up the company’s finances a bit</a>, I’ll admit the video game <a href="https://x.com/OPMerchandise/status/2009627597915717797">and Funko Pop</a> retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.</p>
<p>GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/">has abruptly shut down 400 stores</a> across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm">per SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p>GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/gamestop-plans-up-to-200-store-closures-expects-many-more-on-the-way/">there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019</a>—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.</p>
<h2>The ghost of Tower Records appears in a vision</h2>
<p>The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/for-console-games-downloads-are-approaching-a-tipping-point/">more than half of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s game sales came via download rather than disc</a>, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue</a>, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/sonys-new-playstation-plus-launches-in-us-with-over-800-games/">PlayStation Plus</a>, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">skipping physical releases altogether</a> these days, while Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards</a> that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/">Peter Molyneux</a></strong> made himself a household name as the man credited as the creator of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/">Fable</a></strong> series, is getting set to release his next and potentially final project with <strong>Masters of Albion</strong>, a new god game from his studio 22cans. Molyneux calls the game "<em>the culmination of my life's work</em>," as he and 22cans announce its release date has been set for <strong>April 22, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>It'll arrive exclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">PC through Steam</a>, and 22cans debuted a new trailer for the game today, taking players through a bit of what they can expect from Masters of Albion and showing off plenty of gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Masters of Albion - Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HU0lXuKwB64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beyond Fable, you'd recognize Molyneux's name from the likes of Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and perhaps more infamously from the controversial title, Godus. Beyond Molyneux, several other iconic names, all of whom have worked with Molyneux before, worked on Masters of Albion, including BAFTA-winning game developers and artists Russell Shaw, Mark Healey, Iain Wright, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>



<p>"<em>Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life's work,</em>" said Molyneux as part of the game's release date announcement. "<em>A game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable. It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map</em>."</p>



<p>Molyneux's name may be attached to some of gaming's best titles, but he made himself more infamously known after being branded as <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-never-been-seen-mechanic-peter-molyneux-new-project-hype/">someone who over-hypes projects</a> following Godus and Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube?. It's what makes it difficult to get too excited about Masters of Albion, even if today's trailer makes it seem like it will be a fun and creative experience for players.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, we'll see how Molyneux fares in his next, and potentially final, outing as a game developer. Masters of Albion could be his retirement swansong, or the game that brings a poor and lasting stain at the end of his career.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/</link>
            <guid>1403743</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount continues to put up a fight over the pending sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix. On Wednesday, the company announced it was suing Warner Bros. in a continuation of its attempt at a hostile takeover of the company.</p>



<p>The lawsuit comes just days after Paramount’s latest bid was rejected, again, by Warner Bros. Discover.</p>







<p>According to the lawsuit, Paramount claims that the Warner Bros. Discovery board misled shareholders and concealed financial analysis. In a <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-provides-update-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders</a> announcing the suit, Paramount CEO David Ellison said that the company has <strong>“failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its “risk adjustment” of our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued, saying that shareholders need that information to <strong>“make an informed investment decision on our offer.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-why-paramount-is-fighting-for-warner-bros">Why Paramount Is Fighting For Warner Bros?</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discover</a> were in an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the company to the streaming giant as part of an $82.7 billion deal. The sale would include only the company’s streaming and studios assets, including all of Warner Bros. Games. </p>



<p>Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share doesn’t include the cable channels. Paramount’s offer of $30 would be for ethe entirety of the company. That would put the value of the cable networks at just $2.25 per share if the value of the streaming and studio assets remained the same as the Netflix deal. </p>



<p>Since the agreement was announced, Paramount has continued to try and force a sale to them. Leading up to and after the announcement of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected at least eight Paramount offers. </p>







<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has said that Paramount would need to offer more cash and less debt for it to be reconsidered.</p>



<p>As far as why Paramount would want Warner Bros., it’s a pretty obvious. Video Games aside, which even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix called “minor”</a> in terms of the deal, includes rights to a number of brands and IPs such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,”</strong> Ellison wrote. <strong>“We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our&nbsp;December 4th&nbsp;offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Even as we read WBD’s own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD’s part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn’t add up – much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery have declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>

You cannot pet the dog in Dunderbeck, but you can assuredly eat the unicorn. Just drag its corpse over the puckering mouth on the righthand side. Alternatively, you can chuck the dead unicorn into the mincers on the left and combine the resulting horny horsemeat with other sources of... nutrition, such as rainbow-coloured turds and spoons. I do not know what foodstuffs might result. I refuse to play Dunderbeck’s demo. I watched 20 seconds of the trailer, then spent the next ten minutes brushing my teeth. Here you go.

Dunderbeck is an atypically nauseating inventory management autobattler. It puts you in charge of a jovial exterminator, plying the sweaty streets of Cincinnati, Ohio. Dunderbeck walks automatically along the top of the screen, fighting creatures that range from everyday 'pests' to mythical beasts. You, meanwhile, have the pleasure of arranging and processing any items scooped up enroute, so as to keep Dunderbeck fighting fit. 
</p>
<p>
The challenge with such games is generally a mix of timing and spatial reasoning. In this case, you’ll also have to resist the urge to vom. Dunderbeck himself may puke if you feed him anything unholy, but he, at least, can devour his own sick for unspecified benefits - or simply because he's a disgusting shithead. The pitch is that everything can be eaten “at least once”. What’s more, everything can serve as a weapon: just pop it into the clutching hands beneath the gnashing maw on your HUD.

“Your job is to fight that mess, build with that mess and - I'm sorry to say - eat that mess,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477750/Dunderbeck/">the Steam page</a>. “It's a dirty job, but that's how the sausage is made.” The demo includes two of the game’s townships, which range from forest environments to sewers. The full game includes “over 120 recipes, each requiring one of over 120 items”. That’s 120 too many, as far as I’m concerned. Still, I am not your doctor or licensed nutritionist - I cannot reasonably deny you your fill of unicorn rat-atouille. If you enjoy optimising inventories but don't have a taste for rodents, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a> instead.

                <p>The Sims is no stranger to collaborating with major fashion brands. Back in 2007, developer Maxis partnered up with H&amp;M to bring dozens of real-life clothing items to The Sims 2. In more recent years, both Primark and Moschino have made their way into the series with The Sims 4 Stuff Packs. Now, the American brand Coach is headed to the game in the series' most luxurious collab yet.</p><p>Starting on January 13, The Sims 4 players will gain access to The Coach Collection, a catalog of nine new items inspired by the "wearable staples" and "bold statement pieces" Coach is known for. The Create-A-Sim items coming include the company's Soho sneakers, a varsity jacket, and sleek skirt sets, while Build Mode will receive the heritage trunk and both Tabby and Brooklyn purses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180"></a><figcaption>A look at the upcoming Coach collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png"></figure><p>In addition to these items, The Coach Collection comes with a new family available to move in via The Sims Gallery: The Carriage House. The press release described the family as "three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama." The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the "In The Bag room," which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.</p><p>In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">values are unchanged</a>" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The team also reiterated that it is committed to creating "single-player life simulation experiences" while also teasing upcoming The Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile.</p>

            <p>
We already knew Hytale was likely to have a major early access release this week, but developer Hypixel Studios has now revealed the long-awaited Minecraft-a-like has sold so many copies ahead of its launch that it's made enough money to fund the next two years of development.
</p>
<p>
Development of Hytale, an RPG-like Minecraft-style sandbox experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">began in 2015</a>, garnering plenty of attention - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions into the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But last year it seemed like Hytale's adventure might have reached an end after Riot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">made the decision to pull the plug</a>, forcing Hypixel to announce it would be "winding down" its operations as a result.

<p>
Somewhat miraculously, however, Hytale survived; Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year, and the whole dramatic saga appears to have created massively renewed interest in the project. Ahead of Hytale's early access launch on 13th January this week, Collins-Laflamme revealed Hypixel is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">expecting 1m players on release day</a> - and encouraged purchasers to download the game's launcher in advance (Hytale is only available for purchase via the studio's website during early access) to reduce server stress.
</p><p>
Now, Collins-Laflamme has explained what the massive number of pre-purchases means for Hytale's continued development. "Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases," he wrote <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?s=20">on social media</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," he continued, "we are looking very strong for the future." That's clearly encouraging news, both for early adopters and for the studio as it works to fulfil Hytale's early promise.
</p>
<p>
Players wanting to get involved in Hytale's early access have three options, with Hypixel <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">currently selling</a> a $23.99 USD standard edition, a $41.99 Supporter Edition, and an $83.99 Founder's Edition on its site - with the latter two versions including a selection of additional cosmetic outfits and capes.
