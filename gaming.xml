<figure data-uuid="0dc42ab024b87"><a title="Terminator" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dc42ab024b87/terminator.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bitmap Bureau</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bitmap Bureau <a href="https://www.reef-entertainment.com/post/terminator-2d-no-fate-release-date-moved-to-november-26-2025">has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> has been delayed on all consoles and will now launch on <strong>26th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled for the end of October, the company confirmed that the delay is due to "trade and tariff changes" affecting the Day One and Collector's Editions. Not content to force physical enthusiasts to wait longer, all editions of the game have subsequently been pushed back.</p>
<p>Here's the full announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We wanted to share an important update on the release of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em>. The game will now launch on November 26, 2025.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"This adjustment is due to ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions. Because we are committed to launching all editions together, this new date applies to both physical and digital releases worldwide.</p>
<p>"We truly appreciate your patience and understanding, and we’re sorry for this further delay. The team is working hard to make sure your wait is worth it, and we can’t wait to share</p>
<p>"<em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> with you all this November."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The upcoming game will be an adaptation of the classic 1991 action movie <strong>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</strong> from director James Cameron. It takes inspiration from old-school Sega Mega Drive action games and will feature several playable characters and iconic scenes from the movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei developer Sucker Punch Productions is getting ready to launch the game later this week on PlayStation 5. As part of the marketing promotion, they joined a media roundtable where the series' setting was discussed, among other things. <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/09/sucker-punch-studio-head-on-the-ghost-of-yotei-series-identity-we-cant-imagine-a-ghost-game-in-feudal-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As reported by Filipino website Ungeek</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and founder Brian Fleming revealed that the setting will never really change to somewhere outside Japan:</p>



<p><em>We believe the core of Ghost is someone wielding a katana, that’s part of the essence. We can’t imagine a Ghost game set in, say, feudal Europe. That doesn’t make sense. There are plenty of games set there, but that’s not what a Ghost game is.</em> <em>For us, the natural beauty of Japan is part of the essence of a Ghost game. I gave this answer on stage at Tokyo Game Show, and I think the fans in Japan, really appreciated that. That’s the way we see it. It will always have that core, open-world katana adventure of some kind. Now, we may change time periods, we may explore different settings, but I think there are some boundaries we probably won’t cross.</em></p>



<p>If the core of the games is a character wielding a katana, then it also follows that the series is essentially bound to the samurai era, which started in the late 12th century and ended in the late 1870s, when the Meiji government basically abolished the samurai. Ghost of Tsushima already explored the late 13th century (it's set in 1274, the same year of the real-life Mongol invasion), while Ghost of Yōtei jumped quite far ahead, taking place in 1603. Of course, the Seattle-based developer could absolutely set a new game elsewhere in Japan even before 1603, as the series has been set up more as an anthology than a storyline that continues from installment to installment. Furthermore, both games have been set far away from central Japan, so that's another option that a future entry will undoubtedly explore.</p>



<p>Still, given those constraints, it's hard to imagine the franchise ever reaching as many entries as, say, Final Fantasy, or even just The Elder Scrolls. It's all the more reason to savor the games we get, though, and Ghost of Yōtei is certainly well worth playing if you're a fan of open world action/adventure games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find my review here</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>

            <p>Your cuddly dinosaur aunties at Capcom have warned that they can't "guarantee" various Monster Hunter games will run on Windows 10 PCs after uncle Microsoft end support for the operating system on October 14th this year.
</p>
<p>When that fateful day comes to pass, Capcom "will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will run on Windows 10 systems." Which isn't to say that these games will immediately become unplayable, but "future system updates or game title updates may make the game incompatible on Windows 10 systems".
</p><!--more-->
<p>The developers add that if you have trouble with those Monster Hunter games on Windows 10 PCs after October 14th, "support can only be provided based on information from before support for Windows 10 was discontinued", as they'll be discontinuing services for investigating problems when playing on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of Windows 10 being sunsetted/given the old heave-ho/left crying by the roadside, Microsoft have said that Windows 10 apps and drivers will continue to boot and run normally after the cessation of official support, but you won't get any more free security updates, bug fixes and big feature updates. 
</p>
<p>It's not quite as cut-and-dried as that in practice. Microsoft 365 apps running on personal and commercial Windows 10 PCs <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/">will get security updates until October 10th 2028</a>, and feature updates until August 2026.
</p>
<p>The lack of security updates is the major concern for me. Microsoft are offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates">paid extended security update subscription</a> for people who want to maintain Windows 10 beyond the cut-off date, with availability dependent on region and which version of the OS you're running.
</p><p>Windows10mageddon threatens to leave a lot of PC users in the lurch, though there's a certain amount of Y2K-style hysteria about the fallout. According to <a href="https://www.controlup.com/windows-11-readiness/">one study</a>, around half of Windows PCs still don't run Windows 11. If your machine doesn't have the specs for Windows 11, it seems like you'll need to buy a fresh one. I expect there will be plenty more bulletins from game publishers encouraging players to update their systems.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mrbeast-responds-to-concerns-over-trapping-guy-in-burning-house-for-500-000.1311739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest YouTube video stunt by one <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-lawsuit-beast-games-amazon-hidden-cameras-1851775284">James “MrBeast” Donaldson</a> has already wracked up over 46 million views in just one day and it’s not hard to imagine why. Titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo7i8VTpfNM&amp;t=28s">Would You Risk Dying For $500,000?</a>” it shows a series of challenges in which people brave flame-engulfed obstacles in exchange for money. It’s kind of like David Blaine if, instead of doing absurd and wild stuff himself, he paid other people to do it while also explaining how it was all incredibly fake and just for grim lulz.</p> <p>The infernal trap that’s been drawing the most attention is one in which a stuntman is tied to a chair inside a “burning house” and has to escape and save as much money as he can from inside the house in order to earn the highest cash prize possible. Donaldson bounces back and forth between urgent warnings about how real the flames are and mugging the camera with jokes about MrBeast product placement. The entertainment concept is more grotesquely mundane than anything Phillip K. Dick could have imagined and also, clearly, highly entertaining to millions of people.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This blew up, if you’re curious obviously we had ventilation for the smoke and a kill switch to cut off the fires. We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man. I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.</p> <p>— MrBeast (@MrBeast) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrBeast/status/1972507399413260366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Donaldson defended his uniquely gifted intuition for creating the debased content people crave by promising the whole stunt was tested with professionals multiple times, responding to viral posts about the stunt with additional context. The last thing Donaldson needs after lawsuits last year over <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-internal-investigation-findings-sexual-misconduct-1235150941/">alleged safety violations on his Amazon Prime</a> show is people thinking he doesn’t take the premise of potentially roasting another human being alive for less than the median home price after taxes seriously.</p>

 <p>“We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man,” he wrote on X over the weekend. “I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine.” He expanded on the setup in a comment on the YouTube video as well.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3lzy22r723k2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiglqdgk2xfrl3d2mts5fqecakrqwbllpidp6sbsybsdamtbhqirve"> <p lang="en">Content creators tend to think any spectacle is defensible if they can say health and safety concerns have been attended to behind the scenes, but that’s not really it imho. Mr. Beast’s whole thing is that his subjects’ desperation for cash allows him—a wealthier person—to indulge his sadism.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6?ref_src=embed">southpaw (@nycsouthpaw.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:on5oeywiqx32fh2zau473wz6/post/3lzy22r723k2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-29T12:45:09.235Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“In case there’s any concern about the safety of the stuntman contestant, I just wanted to mention that we take safety extremely seriously,” he added. “Every challenge was tested by multiple stuntmen, we have a full rescue team on standby with firefighters, EMTs and divers equipped with an ambulance and fire truck. We also had a pyro team controlling the fires and multiple fire suppression methods on every challenge to ensure we could essentially turn off the fire if there was ever an issue. But our stunt coordinator did an amazing job as always, and none of these systems were ever needed. Just wanted to be transparent with you all since I saw some concern!”</p> <p>This is the Catch-22 at the heart of this entire genre of extremely watchable algorithm-bait. Either the entire thing is so real and authentic that it’s an absolutely monstrous thing for everyone involved to be associated with and signals the utter depravity of modern capitalism, or the stunt is all so fake and performative that none of it matters and you’ve been conned out of 25 minutes of your week just so some guy can hock candy bars.</p> <p>Either way, it kinda sucks!</p>

When the boy stands up to fight the monsters that tower over him, you don't feel the same dangerous edge as the father. You feel the vulnerability of a young person in over his head. When he tells the monsters to stay away from his sister, it's in a low, almost pleading voice. As he screams for help, there is desperation, but also the fear of someone far too young to deal with this situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of these scenes is from the 2010 English-language release of Nier, while the second is from the 2021 English release. The writer-director of Nier, Yoko Taro, made two versions of the game back in 2010: one where the protagonist is a boy trying to save his sister, and one where the protagonist is a father trying to save his daughter. The latter (which was called Nier Gestalt in Japan) was reportedly only made because the American marketing team of Square Enix thought the Western audience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yoko-taro-didnt-mean-to-make-nier-sad-on-purpose/1100-6490892/">wouldn't respond as well</a> to the young boy as the main character. When Nier was finally re-released in a new form in 2021 (the cheekily named <em>Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139…</em>), Taro decided to go with the boy protagonist for the English language region this time. Now, the modern English version only gives us the younger protagonist.</p><p dir="ltr">When players discuss the game today, there doesn't tend to be a lot of consideration for this difference in versions. Yes, the main character is different, but the majority of the game is the same. It doesn't really matter that much, they claim.</p><p dir="ltr">Doesn't it?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576940" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576940"></a><figcaption>Festivities in the desert village of Facade in Nier Replicant.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576940-3822412-vlcsnap-2021-04-22-03h48m06s250.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">How can these two gaming experiences be the same? The emotional quality and perspective is markedly different and evokes different reactions. The critic Dia Lacina is one of those who perceptively <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nier-replicant-ver01/" rel="nofollow ">discussed this issue for Vice</a>, and, struck by that piece, I decided to watch the openings of both versions of the game and compare them. They certainly feel distinctly different to me.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other classic games being remade or remastered in recent years. Shadow of the Colossus, Silent Hill 2, Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid 3, Suikoden I and II, and Final Fantasy Tactics, just to point to a handful. I sometimes wonder if there is enough appreciation amongst players for just how different the new experiences can be to the originals, though, especially considering that the fame and historical significance of the games usually comes from those originals.</p><p dir="ltr">Film fans will contemplate the differences between Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings theatrical and extended editions, or the intriguing variations in Wong Kar-wai's cuts of The Grandmaster (the critic David Ehrlich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214255/http://www.film.com/movies/wong-kar-wai-the-grandmaster-ruined-by-american-cut" rel="nofollow ">went as far as to argue</a> that if you've only seen the American version of that film, you haven't really seen it). Readers will debate over the best translations of Dostoevsky or Hugo. Gamers, on the other hand, seem more likely to overlook changes in areas such as narrative and art direction, even in games that focus on storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's look at Final Fantasy VII. It's one of the most famous video games in history, so I wouldn't be surprised if a fair amount of players have experienced it. But what did they experience, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe you played FFVII when it came out in 1997, in the original Japanese, on the original PlayStation. Maybe you played it when it came to America and Europe for the same console, and thus experienced the localized version, which also included new gameplay features. Perhaps you played the 1998 Eidos PC version, which revealed mouths on characters. Did you use mods, or the new features like the Character Booster in modern versions of the game? Perhaps you even played FFVII via the abridged Ever Crisis on your phone.</p><p dir="ltr">The fascinating thing is just how different these versions of a classic can be. The initial version of FFVII in Japan, for example, reportedly lacks a special flashback scene that triggers when you go to the Nibelheim Mansion basement near the end of the game; this scene is one of the most memorable in the story and gives the player a very special and touching glimpse of Zack Fair, an important character in the narrative who will become even more important to the series later.</p><p dir="ltr">What about the English localization? As the translator and critic Tim Rogers detailed in his video series, there are some particularly interesting changes in English, such as <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/zack-wasnt-actually-aeriss-boyfriend-in-the-japanese-ve-1798639613" rel="nofollow ">dialogue that arguably alters the emotional status of Aerith and Zack's relationship</a>. Or should I say Aeris, the name that so many of us recall from playing the original Western release, but has now become close to obsolete? Meanwhile, the PC version of the game featured mouths on character models, which altered the feel of certain scenes; Aerith dying while Sephiroth stands over her has less impact to me when Sephiroth is bizarrely opening his mouth wide as if performing at an opera house. Maybe you just skipped FFVII and played the remake, because that's Final Fantasy VII too, right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576941" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576941"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth surrounded by flames in Final Fantasy 7 Remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576941-3657122-02_sephiroth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you've played the FFVII remake games, you've experienced a different story to the original. This is a topic of much debate in the fandom--whether the remake is the same story as the original or not--and there is no simple answer. While it does indeed cover the main events, it does so while adding new things, taking other things away, and changing the execution of the older scenes. Suddenly the antagonist Sephiroth is appearing in the part of the story where he was never present in the original. Though Yoshinori Kitase wanted him to be like Spielberg's Jaws in the original--mysterious--that isn’t as emphasised in FFVII Remake.</p><p dir="ltr">You can even briefly play as Sephiroth in Rebirth, while in the original he was kept critically distant from you: an untouchable, terrifyingly powerful figure. To control him would be unthinkable. Zack, someone barely present in the original, is far more prominent now, and we see him even temporarily join forces with Cloud to fight Sephiroth in Rebirth. Even without the story changes, the difference in visuals, music, direction, gameplay, and the addition of voice acting would all make for a very different experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It's remarkable how quickly players will sweep these kinds of changes under the rug, though. It's still basically the same story, they often shrug. Others will go as far as to treat a remake as a replacement for the original, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/16/21221953/final-fantasy-7-remake-original-playstation-worth-playing/" rel="nofollow ">as Carolyn Petit pointed out for Polygon</a>, that just doesn't make sense.</p><p dir="ltr">Differing translations also alter the feel of a work; it's something often discussed in literature and cinema but not quite as much when it comes to video games, outside of a few specialist websites or social media accounts. In one of the most important (albeit optional) scenes in Final Fantasy VI, to cite one example, Celes throws herself off a cliff. In the original English version on the Super Nintendo (where it was released as Final Fantasy III), she does this after hearing stories about how other people had taken "a leap of faith" to restore their spirits. In the newer, more faithful English translations, however, it's framed as pointedly dark. Both versions inevitably feel different, even if--as the translator <a href="https://legendsoflocalization.com/comparisons/final-fantasy-vi/part-12/" rel="nofollow ">Clyde Mandelin noted</a> in his comparison--some players back in 1996 still saw the old version as grim.</p><p dir="ltr">The visual direction of scenes alone can change how a work comes across. The <a href="https://youtu.be/P8I5EIBLQ08" rel="nofollow ">differences between the original Silent Hill 2 and the Silent Hill 2 remake</a> are immediately striking, and something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who" rel="nofollow ">others</a> have written about. As many have observed, the fog in the original is overpowering to the point where you can't make character faces out as clearly, lending a distinct sense of unease to the scenes. Atmospheric differences also arise with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/30/16946392/shadow-of-the-colossus-review-remake-ps4-playstation-sony/" rel="nofollow ">Shadow of the Colossus remake</a>. The mansion setting in the original Resident Evil on PlayStation compared to the one in the GameCube remake looks dramatically different; the former has the kind of plainness you might encounter in an old, empty hotel, while the latter is much darker and Gothic, like somewhere Dracula might live. The original looks scarier to me, because it feels closer to home, like a place I might have been in before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576944" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4576944"></a><figcaption>A look at the mansion in Resident Evil HD Remastered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4576944-2783625-hl2-hl2-2015-01-1401-56-2612.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These are all official changes, but gaming becomes even more complicated when you recall how intertwined the medium is with modding. Modding is so prevalent, and so part of the core of PC gaming specifically, that many players will download and use them to "improve" a game in numerous ways without much care for how this critically alters their experience in regard to visuals, audio, and interactivity. People will employ mods as casually as they grab some ketchup to improve the taste of their food. The mods will make the game look "sharper," "fix" the translation to make it more accurate, or add in cut content. They will, you are told, greatly enhance your experience with the game. But which game are you playing, then?</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps there is no definitive version of a game. Perhaps there are just so many factors to consider for the medium, as even the tool you use to play something--be it keyboard and mouse or a console controller--can dramatically alter your experience. What about the way playing a text-based game, like Disco Elysium, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysiums-switch-port-feels-like-the-perfect-form-for-this-most-novelistic-of-games" rel="nofollow ">can feel more like reading a book when you play it on a handheld system</a>?</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe in prescribing a "right" way to play a game--but I do believe in approaching your gaming experiences with awareness and thought. It can be more taxing than the casual approach many of us take, but it's also exciting, because it makes us think about one of the powerful qualities of this medium: fluidity. Choose prudently while you stand before waves of different versions of a game. Your favorite version may not be the one the general public recommends, or even the one the creator prefers. It'll be the one that fits you best, for whatever reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Remakes, remasters, mods, and so on are all fine in concept, even wonderful, especially as it can be so hard to play older classics these days. It's worth celebrating all the versions of classics that we have, but it's also important to think about each version as an independent work. It's not so much about focusing on which version is better or worse. It's more about reflecting on the fascinating differences in the classic works of the video game medium.</p>

The facility, post-disaster, is in a state of disrepair, and to progress, you have to fix doors, engines, lights, and assorted furniture.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Lift - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX8QBjHMfyk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some of these tasks are obvious–this chair is wobbly, so you need a screwdriver and a screw–while others are little spatial and logic puzzles of wires, power sources, and converters to open doors or power up machines. Everything is wonderfully tactile: a replaced lightbulb sputters to life, a listing bench straightens up, machinery whirrs and rumbles once you’ve got the right pieces in place. There are tons of<a href="https://aftermath.site/pacific-drive-star-trucker-buttons-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> buttons to press</a> and levers to flick, and you have to physically pull drawers and doors to move them. If you can’t find the right repair bits lying around, you can craft them from recycled materials and blueprints in a machine that gave me fond flashbacks to my crafting setup in protagonist Morgan’s office in <a href="https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Prey</em></a>, though more than once I eschewed the chore of recycling detritus and simply swapped pieces from one bit to another. As the core mechanic of the playtest, all of this fixing is incredibly satisfying to do, even when your repairs are more aesthetic than world-saving.</p><p>Atop all this is a narrative full of strange characters, guiding you through the station and into how to repair the titular lift to progress. After what is basically the game’s tutorial, the playtest shuttles you to a slice deeper into the game, where there are a ton of quests to pursue that sometimes felt a little overwhelming narratively–fix X to fix Y to do Z in ways that sometimes felt a little padded–but also mostly happened organically as I wandered around seeing what I could tinker with. The atmosphere is unsettling, but so far there haven’t been any monsters or jump scares, which I hope maintains through the full game. I’m not the best spatial reasoner, and I’d hate to do it under duress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fantastic Signals</figcaption></figure><p>The game is still a work-in-progress– I don’t love the inventory system, which can be clunky to scroll through, though when you hover over an interactable object the game will often choose the right tool for the job for you, which makes things a little simpler. And to progress you sometimes need to repair enough things in an area to raise it to a certain level; there’s a narrative justification for this, and I love the contrast between fixing important machines and just changing an overhead bulb because it’s nice to have, but it sometimes felt a little bit like busywork. </p><p>But overall I was totally charmed with the time I spent in <em>The Lift</em> and curious to see how its puzzles and story grow in the full game. I got into the playtest simply by clicking the “request access” button on Steam; I’m sorry to be telling you about it when it ends so soon, which I didn’t realize until writing this blog, but if you miss it, <em>The Lift</em> is slated to come out in 2026.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers"><h3>New Coalition Seeks To Help Palestinian Game Developers ‘Speak Loudly’ Through Games</h3></a><p>Palestinian Voices in Games aims to ‘push against the dehumanisation of Palestinians’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-dc-ice"><h3>Playing Is This Seat Taken?

              <p>Microsoft and Asus’ collaborative handheld Xbox device is arriving on October 16, 2025, with pre-orders available at various outlets right now. And as things go on the internet, eBay listings promising confirmed pre-orders are now <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rog+ally+xbox+x&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=rog+ally+xbox&amp;_osacat=0">going for two to three times the retail price</a> –which is pretty ridiculous when the top-tier model of this handheld is already a thousand bucks.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-handheld-rog-ally-x-price-preorder-2000629161">Xbox’s Handheld Finally Has A Price, And It Costs More Than An Xbox</a></p> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is an Xbox-skinned portable PC much like the Steam Deck or Asus’ own non-Xbox-branded “Ally.” These devices have become quite popular in recent years because, well, they’re usually pretty awesome. With the ability to carry around massive storefronts like Steam on the go, and enough horsepower to run graphical powerhouses like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, it’s no wonder Microsoft wanted to get in on the action with a more Xbox-themed offering. The only problem is that the hardware manufacturer and game publisher is asking folks to spend $600 on the basic model, and a full four-digit $1,000 for the top-tier model featuring a more powerful processor. And yet, some eBayers think folks will spend even more than that even though it hasn’t sold out elsewhere. Wild.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629896">© Screenshot: eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Who’s buying this thing anyway?</h2> <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X (which is the more powerful of the two models) is <i>technically</i> more powerful than some of its competitors. It features a new AMD Z2E AI Chip. Is it a generational leap? Certainly not enough to prompt Valve to base a Steam Deck successor on it.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Microsoft Reveals The First $800 Xbox With Another Round Of Price Hikes</a></p> <p>Still, the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/handheld-gaming-pcs/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-priced-at-usd1-000-and-available-to-pre-order-in-october-making-it-officially-the-most-expensive-xbox-ever/">improved performance of the Z2E</a> <i>is</i> worth noting, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Handhelds/comments/1m8ujhf/at_low_tdps_the_z2_extreme_is_a_generational_leap/">around a 10 to 20-percent performance improvement</a> over TKTK, and sometimes a bit more, under certain circumstances. That improvement, however, comes at a cost, namely about $500 more than what you’d pay for a Steam Deck, and $100 more than Asus’ excellent ROG Ally X, which is not the Xbox-branded one. (No, you’re not dumb, this naming convention is.)</p>

 <p>So, that really just leaves the controller-based Xbox user interface, which reduces the overall processing power Windows takes up and is more gamepad-friendly, and the unique controller grips. And even then, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">folks have found a way to get the new Xbox game launcher working</a> on regular, non-Xbox-branded Ally portable PCs, and, to be honest, while I haven’t held a ROG Xbox Ally, it’s gonna be hard to compete with the Steam Deck’s excellent ergonomics.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934">The Biggest Reason To Buy The Xbox Ally Handheld Just Leaked</a></p> <p>At $1,000 for the top-tier Xbox handheld, it’s hard to see a compelling reason to upgrade if you already have a Steam Deck, and certainly not if you have a more powerful handheld than that. Who, then, is gonna get suckered into spending twice that for an eBay pre-order? Hopefully not you!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Welcome to a new week. Will it be better than last week? I really hope so! Anyway, today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and stuff you might care about, features a new and less shiny PS5, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sales data,<em> Borderlands 4</em> DLC news, a content creator retiring, and a cool Daft Punk video.</p> <h2><strong>New PS5 Model Ditches All That Shiny Black Plastic</strong></h2> <p>A new model of the PlayStation 5 has leaked online ahead of an official announcement from Sony, and while it’s not a massive update to the current iteration of the console, it does include one tweak that seems to be making a lot of people happy: The new PS5 doesn’t include shiny black plastic.<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1972613838953476238"> As reported by Zuby_Tech</a>, new photos and information about the refreshed PS5 show that it features matte black plastic, saving you from having to cover your PS5 in nasty fingerprints every time you dare to move or touch it.</p> <p>Other changes found in this new, updated PS5 console include different-colored USB ports, a smaller SSD, and a new heatsink. The console is also overall a bit lighter now, likely thanks to more stamped metal parts inside. No word on when to expect this new console to hit shelves, but I’d bet it won’t be long, as we are getting close to the holiday season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em> Outselling <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">『SILENT HILL f』</p> <p>全世界累計出荷本数※が100万本を突破しました。<br>プレイいただいた皆さまありがとうございます。</p> <p>■ゲームはこちら: <a href="https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg">https://t.co/msZNoMHzVg</a></p> <p>※2025年9月26日時点 当社調べ<br>※パッケージ版出荷数とダウンロード版販売数の合計<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SILENTHILL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SILENTHILL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%92%E3%83%AB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#サイレントヒル</a> <a href="https://t.co/P6jl93zhGW">pic.twitter.com/P6jl93zhGW</a></p> <p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1972577585558433936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>People really like <em>Silent Hill f</em>, Konami’s first original mainline entry in the long-running horror series in over a decade. So I’m not shocked to see it selling so well. According to Konami, <em>Silent Hill f</em> sold a million copies in around 24 hours. <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/topics/20250929/">In a press release announcing the news</a>, the publisher also confirmed that <em>Silent Hill f</em> was selling faster than last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This is good news for <em>Silent Hill</em> fans who have spent the past decade putting up with a lot of bad news, garbage, and disappointment. Hopefully, this new era of <em>Silent Hill</em> isn’t short-lived.</p>

 <h2><strong>GOG Adds More Classic Games To Its Preservation Program&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Classic PC gaming store Good Old Games, aka <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WX">GOG, announced recently</a> that over half a dozen more titles were being added to its ongoing preservation program. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Launched in 2024</a>, the GOG Preservation Program is the store’s long-term plan to keep certain classic PC games playable, updated, and accessible. It’s a great idea and one which, if GOG sticks to it, could be extremely helpful for games that no longer have official publisher or developer support.</p>

 <p>Here’s the latest list of games added to the program, many of which are currently on sale to celebrate the news:</p> <p><em>– Gothic 1</em><br> <em>– Gothic 2</em><br> <em>– Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness</em><br> <em>– Mortal Kombat Trilogy</em><br> <em>– Freespace 2</em><br> <em>– XIII Century Gold Edition</em><br> <em>– Stranglehold</em></p>

 <h2><strong>Gearbox Reveals <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em>‘s First DLC Character&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p>Over the weekend during Tokyo Game Show, Gearbox and 2K Games revealed the first playable DLC character coming to<em> Borderlands 4:</em> C4SH, a gambling robot cowboy built around luck and chance. <a href="https://x.com/borderlandshub/status/1972264469280559301">Fan account Borderlands 4 Bulletin shared more information</a> about the new Vault Hunter on social media directly from the Gearbox TGS panel. The studio says that C4SH will have 3 action skills just like the other playable characters and that the character’s skills are “distinctly unpredictable, as they all involve an element of chance.”</p>

 <p>C4SH will be available in Q1 2026 for all players on all platforms who own the Super Deluxe Edition of <em>Borderlands 4,</em> buy the Vault Hunter Pack DLC, or who purchase the game’s first Story Pack when it’s available.</p> <p><strong><em>Skyrim</em> Grandma Shirley Curry Retiring (Again)&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/almost-90-years-old-skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-says-shes-retiring-from-the-adventuring-life-im-tired-im-not-having-fun-anymore/">As reported by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Shirley Curry, better known online as the famous <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, is retiring from content creation. The nearly 90-year-old gamer, who will appear in <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> when that finally launches, <a href="https://youtu.be/89L4oV-ZKqM">confirmed the news in a new VLOG uploaded to her YouTube channel.</a> She explained that she’s just “bored” with playing <em>Skyrim</em> again and isn’t having a great experience on YouTube anymore, as many of the comments she got were just, according to her, younger kids shouting about how much they loved their video game grandma. She says she wanted more feedback and interesting conversations.</p> <p>“That’s why I’m just going to stop uploading anything to do with <em>Skyrim</em>,” said Curry. “I’m tired, I’m not having fun anymore, probably because of all the little kids on there. I think that’s about all I have to say.”</p> <p>Curry will keep making VLOGS and blogging, but her days with <em>Skyrim</em> are over. Probably. It was just a year ago that Curry actually announced similar plans to retire from <em>Elder Scrolls</em> content, but then came back and even made a video of herself playing the <em>Oblivion Remaster</em>. But based on how she sounds in this new VLOG, I get the feeling she really is done with <em>Skyrim</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is turning into a giant <em>Fortnite</em>-like mess</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-free-to-play-game-tech-debt-ceo-discord-ps5-pc-fps-performance-2000629256"><em>Helldivers 2</em> was, at one point, planned to be a free-to-play game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-america-3ds-satoru-shibata-2000629269">Nintendo of America’s New CEO Seems Fun</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

C4ash is one of two new vault hunters teased by Gearbox, but the identity of the second one has yet to be revealed.</p><p>Claptrap voice actor Jim Foronda reacted to the announcement by sharing his own "head canon' about the relationship between his character and C4sh.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">SUDDEN AND *VERY UNOFFICIAL* HEADCANON:<br>Claptrap mistakenly believes he pioneered pronouncing the 4 in one's own model number as the letter A… and now he thinks C4SH is his biggest fan on Kairos. <a href="https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Oi19N6NJsn</a></p>  — Jim Foronda (@JimForonda) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimForonda/status/1972147470076670348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>C4sh and the rest of the first story pack DLC will be released in Q1 2026.

Wider availability for the chatbot will come later, Epic said.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-launches-beta-for-ai-chatbot-that-reads-your-xbox-profile/1100-6531875/" data-ref-id="1100-6531875">Microsoft rolled out its own AI chatbot to help Xbox users with a variety of things.</a></p><p>Before this, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">used AI to replicate the late James Earl Jones' voice to bring a Darth Vader to Fortnite</a> as a character people could converse with. After this, Epic Games announced an AI-powered NPC Persona device that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-be-just-the-beginning-of-fortnites-ai-implementation/1100-6532094/" data-ref-id="1100-6532094">allows users to create their own AI-powered characters.</a></p><p>Game developers have used artificial intelligence technologies for a long time already, but things have progressed quickly of late due to new advancements for things like generative AI. The use of AI technologies in game development has proven controversial as well, as people fear things like job losses and plagiarism issues.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, with Halloween right around the corner, a leak has suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-are-you-next-rumored-guests-for-fortnites-halloween-party/1100-6535058/" data-ref-id="1100-6535058">characters from the popular Netflix movie KPop Demon Hunters</a> will come to Fortnite for the Fortnitemares 2025 event. This is expected to start in early October, but we don't know for sure when it will be just yet. Even so, there have been plenty of leaks about what we can expect to see from this year's spooky festivities, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">you can read all about them here</a>.</p><p>Additionally, Epic Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fornite-disables-john-cena-emote-after-major-peacemaker-s2-twist/1100-6535083/" data-ref-id="1100-6535083">removed a John Cena emote following a major Peacemaker Season 2 twist.</a></p>

            <p>Earth Must Die was one of the stand-out premieres in yesterday's PC Gaming Show. The cartoon-styled space romp shone with crisp and vibrant visuals, and boasted a cast list that read like a who's-who of British comedy.</p>
<p>Starring in it are Joel Fry (Game of Thrones, Dr Who, Our Flag Means Death), Ben Starr (Expedition 33, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>), Martha Howe-Douglas (co-creator of Ghosts), Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Mike Wozniak (Man Down, Taskmaster, Three Bean Salad podcast), Don Warrington (Rising Damp!), Matthew Holness (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace), Tamsin Greig (Black Books, Green Wing!), and Stevie Martin, Julie Nolke, Sophie Duker, Emma Fryer, Alasdair Beckett-King, Rosie Holt, Jon Blyth, Sam O'Leary, Tom Lawrinson, Sally Beaumont, David Montieth and Inel Tomlinson.</p>
<p>Yes, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/jon-blyth">Jon Blyth who once contributed to Eurogamer</a>, which I'm sure is the accolade he shares and not his recent BAFTA-nominated performance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">Thank Goodness You're Here!</a></p>

<p>An eye-catching trailer and an eye-catching cast list, but details about the actual game were relatively scarce. What actually is Earth Must Die, then, and when is it coming out? Having talked to the game's creator Dan Marshall today, I know some of the answers.</p><p>Earth Must Die, like many of Size Five's games (that's Marshall's studio name), is a point-and-click adventure. And like many of Size Five's games, it comes with a twist. "The idea is it's a point-and-click adventure game but the lead character refuses to touch anything," Marshall tells me. "He's above it; because he's from land-owning gentry, he won't press buttons. So the game is a... conversation-'em-up. That's not a real word is it?</p>

<p>"But it's not like Monkey Island where you can constantly replay conversations until you get the right stuff. Conversations play through, and you choose how much of a dick you're going to be [I'll come back to this point], and puzzle solving is more about manipulating other people into doing what you want to achieve rather than you actually doing it. So it's more about ordering other people around to do things, rather than picking stuff up and having your own inventory."</p>
<p>Indeed, Earth Must Die <em>doesn't </em>have an inventory, so you can't touch anything or pick anything up, or keep anything with you. I don't think I've ever heard of an adventure/point-and-click game having done that before.</p>
<p>To come back to the "choose how much of a dick you're going to be" point earlier: Earth Must Die is also a game about a baddie. A proper baddie. Not a baddie who secretly wants to be good.</p>

<p>Says Marshall: "What they do in games quite often, or in Despicable Me or Star Wars or whatever, is they go 'this time you're going to play as one of the people in the Empire', and they chicken out about a third of the way through and you defect to the Rebel side. And actually [the character is] a goodie because playing a baddie all the way through is slightly irksome.</p><p>"We've worked out ways of balancing [Valak's] story so that he's just a dick - he's a fascist dictator bellend. I won't mince my words! But he's not the hero of the story. But you do get to play him and choose his dialogue options and all the rest of it, while the world crumbles around him."</p>
<p>Valak is the lead, then, a Ming the Merciless-like character in charge of a vast alien empire who one day discovers Earth and an empire better organised than his. "So it's basically: you're this Ming the Merciless character with your 1950s wobbly sets, and then the Empire from Star Wars turns up and invades and takes over and rolls you into their much better empire. So that leaves you in the slightly awkward position of becoming the de facto Rebel leader for your [rebellion]," Marshall says.</p>

<p>I think it sounds great, and if Size Five's last game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lair-of-the-clockwork-god-review-platform-meets-adventure-with-hilarious-consequences">Lair of the Clockwork God</a> is anything to go by, there's every chance it will be (I wish I'd been bold enough to give that game five stars; don't tell Chris Tapsell I said that). But when is Earth Must Die coming out?</p><p>One of the upsides of holding back a reveal until the vocal parts have been recorded is the game's nearly done. As in, there's an outside chance Earth Must Die could even release this year, publisher No More Robots told me today. It's a very tentative aim, so bear that in mind, but it could happen. And if it doesn't, a 2026 release presumably won't be far behind.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swindle-dev-dan-marshall-reveals-new-spacefaring-game-in-the-eurogamer-podcast">I was delighted to host Dan Marshall and writing and design partner Ben Ward (the Ben of 'Ben and Dan') on the interview podcast I ran</a> a few years ago, and I don't think any guests made me laugh harder.</p>

<p>In a new announcement, Evil Empire revealed that it'll be stepping behind the development wheel of Brotato while the game's initial devs, Blobfish Games, head off to focus on new projects.</p>
<p>This 'live ops' work is very similar to what we saw Evil Empire do with Dead Cells — heck, the studio was founded by former Motion Twin devs for this very reason — so we're excited to see what the team will cook up for the runnin', gunnin' potato roguelike.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmrqxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Evil Empire has said that it has no post-launch Brotato plans to reveal at the moment, though it has teased that an update will be coming our way in October featuring a new mob called 'The Gobbler'.</p>
<p>The studio shared the full Bortato statement on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/evilempirestudio.bsky.social/post/3lzy6ihdh4k2a">BlueSky</a>, which you can check out below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big news: today we're feeling chipper as we're picking up Brotato!<br>
Blobfish Games has been carrying it for years, and they've done an incredible job. Now they want to make new games (which we're very excited to play), and so they're trusting us to keep Brotato alive while they do their thing. That's both an honor and a little terrifying.<br>
In case you hadn't realised already, we live and breathe roguelikes, and we've got over 6 years of 'live ops' experience that we can put to good use here. We also just genuinely love this game — there's a few of us whose 'hours played' stats are way too high... So, this means that we'll be doing what we know works best — working with the players as closely as possible to mash their ideas with ours, while we release regular content updates.<br>
We'll start sharing some broad ideas with you soon and we might just wedge in some betas in the coming months too, What you can expect is more chaos, more experiments, and maybe a few disasters along the way. That's how good games grow. And this one deserves to keep growing. Sprouting?<br>
Thank you again to Blobfish Games for your trust, we can't wait to get stuck in!<br>
PS: The first update is on its way, but you may want to update the game already for a little something something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from all the Brotato bonus content, Evil Empire will be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> to Switch and Switch 2 at some point this year. This one has racked up some pretty positive reviews throughout its early access period, so it'll be interesting to see whether it lives up to the hype.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-is-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1311643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that a new Lord of the Rings game is in development, and that a deal regarding the game's funding, which Insider-Gaming alleges will partially come from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), and potentially even the new game, could be revealed next week.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming's report doesn't include details about the new game, save for a claim that this new title is "<em>a third-person action game that is designed, in a way, to 'compete with Hogwarts Legacy.'"</em></p>



<p>Beyond the ADIO's involvement, Embracer Group, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rights-embracer-low-price/">purchased the rights to the major fantasy franchise and the right to develop new videogames for it in 2022</a>, are also, as expected, involved. The other studio mentioned in the report is a studio called <a href="https://www.getrevenge.ch/">Revenge</a>.</p>



<p>The last time we got a third-person action game set within the world of The Lord of the Rings was the Middle-Earth series from <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. and the now shuttered Monolith Productions</a>. It's the series that fans remember for introducing the infamous Nemesis System, though, thanks to WB having a copyright hold on the mechanic, we can bet it probably won't be included in whatever this new title is.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's exciting to know that there is at least talks of a new action game coming from the world of The Lord of the Rings. The classic PlayStation 2-era titles from EA based on Peter Jackson's films, still hold up in the eyes of many players who were around at the time, and even though we only got two of them, the Middle-Earth games from Monolith Productions are memorable for more than just a single groundbreaking game mechanic.</p>



<p>It would also be nice to see a solid Lord of the Rings game appear on the scene again, since the last two games based on the franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-gollums-failure-causes-daedalic-to-shut-down-studio-shift-to-publishing-only/">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-the-shire/">Tales of the Shire</a>, didn't exactly hit their mark. </p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4"> Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a>'s latest trailer, in which an entire nerd cave's worth of miniatures spanning all four in-game factions are gibbed, gutted and burned in about 90 seconds. 
</p>
<p>Somewhat to my surprise, this is the first time I've watched a Warhammer videogame and tried to calculate the bodycount in terms of tabletop figurine prices. My pen-and-paper estimates are profoundly upsetting, and that was before I looked at Games Workshop's current catalogue - I think for the first time since 1999 - and adjusted my figures for inflation. Do any of you play physical Warhammer tabletop games right now? How does that balance out, exactly? Do you just sort of... not buy food?

<p>Anyway, traumatic spreadsheeting aside, this is a heck of a trailer. The Blood Angels hit the stage first and are immediately waylaid by the Orcs, who are themselves flanked by the Adeptus Mechanicus, who are then pounced upon by the Necrons. It's like watching four drunk cosplayers trying to pull off a barbershop quartet, but then somebody elbows somebody in the codpiece, and it rapidly descends into a squelchy scrum of people slurring "FOR THE AMPERSAND". We also get to see a bit of base-building, along with plentiful glimpses of the HUD.
</p><p>With Dawn Of War 4, new developers KING ART Games aren't so much angling forward into the grimdark future as harkening back to Relic's original Dawn Of War. They've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dawn-of-war-4-is-a-modern-interpretation-of-dawn-of-war-1-with-some-cool-adeptus-mechanicus-er-mechanics"> shared a bit</a> about how they're building on the first game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> mechanics, while largely avoiding the subject of Dawn Of War 3. The new game is out in 2026.</p>

Set against the popular isekai (otherworld) theme, the story follows a protagonist who, after getting lost, is pulled into a mysterious otherworld. Guided by a “mysterious figure,” the protagonist navigates an unknown and perilous realm, using available resources (cards) to struggle for <a title="Genres > Survival [463 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> in a world filled with danger.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Highly Randomized Game Mechanics</strong><ul><li>In <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, aside from the fixed map background for each chapter, level events, enemy types and quantities, and battlefield setup are entirely randomized. This ensures endless replayability, allowing players to embark on countless unique survival journeys in a near-infinitely varied world!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ever-Changing Terrain and Cards</strong><ul><li>To survive in <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, players must first master the terrain and their cards. On an 8×8 grid, every action can significantly impact the outcome of the game.</li><li>Leverage the environment to set traps for enemies, exploit strategic positioning for hit-and-run tactics to avoid encirclement, and minimize damage in each battle to maximize your chances of survival.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Survive in a <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious Board-Based World Using Diverse Items and Cards</strong><ul><li>In <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>, players can choose from various occupations, each with unique cards and rare treasures. Forge your strategy and learn to wield their power to survive. While failure is an expected part of your journey, you can use Soul Orbs earned at the end of each run to enhance your abilities, making complete victory an achievable goal!</li><li>Additionally, players must also carefully study enemy traits and behaviors. While a single enemy may not be too difficult to handle, a group acting together can create overwhelming trouble in an instant! Learning enemy behavior patterns and predicting their actions will greatly enhance a player’s chances of survival.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Running Away Is Not Shameful—It’s Actually Useful</strong><ul><li>Given the scarcity of recovery options, minimizing battle damage is the central focus of <em>Lost in Fantaland</em>. You don’t need to defeat every monster in each chapter. If you’re uncertain about your remaining health, choosing to skip unnecessary battles and head straight for the Boss is a valid tactic—after all, survival is what defines a successful <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>. There are even specific items that allow you to escape non-Boss battles entirely.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>Lost in Fantaland</em> is full of surprises and randomness. Use your cards to craft powerful high-damage or high-defense combos, defeat the otherworldly monsters, and pave your way back home! With repeated challenges, you might even uncover the hidden secrets of this mysterious world—who knows?!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/lost-in-fantaland-for-ps5-ps4-and-switch-launches-october-9]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2020, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-games-boss-dan-houser-leaving-the-gta-and/1100-6473383/" data-ref-id="1100-6473383">left the company</a> after over two decades as one of the driving forces behind the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. While Houser has since launched a new company, Absurd Ventures, he recently shared his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and explained why Bully 2 never materialized.</p><p>During a panel appearance at Los Angeles Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>), Houser was asked about how he feels regarding GTA 6, the first Grand Theft Auto game in decades that he had no involvement with.</p><p>"I think it's a great privilege to have worked on something that big--you know, I wrote the last 10 or 11 of them, so I think the world's probably had enough GTA from me ... There's always a new story, so it's not going to be a story that I wrote or a character set that I developed. I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure."</p><p>Houser has previously voiced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-on-bully-sequel-i-know-i-want-to/1100-6414948/" data-ref-id="1100-6414948">his desire to see a sequel</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, the 2006 game set at a boarding school. When he was asked about the reasons why Bully 2 didn't come to pass, Houser cited "bandwidth issues," before adding, "If you've got a small lead creative team and a a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want ... With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p><p>Picking a favorite game from his time at Rockstar proved to be difficult for Houser. He noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> was "the best thing that I worked on [and the] best single kind of realization of open-world storytelling thematic consistency and understanding how the games are assembled to take you on an an emotional journey." He also cited GTA 4, GTA 5, Bully, and Red Dead Redemption as some of his best experiences at Rockstar.</p><p>Houser's next project is a comic book miniseries called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-boss-american-caper-comic-book-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6535074/" data-ref-id="1100-6535074">American Caper</a>, which will be released by Dark Horse Comics on November 12. He also said that Absurd Ventures' first video games will be a currently untitled "open-world third-person comedy," and A Better Paradise, which he described as "a third-person dystopian tragedy." Both games are still early in development.</p>

<p>The acquisition group, dubbed “The Consortium,” consists of three companies. First is the PIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. The PIF has expanded its reach into the video game industry through its Savvy Games Group, an entity founded in 2021. In the last four years, the PIF has purchased stakes in gaming companies such as Nintendo, Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive, Capcom, Embracer Group, and Nexon. The Savvy Games Group also owns American mobile gaming company Scopley, and earlier this year, announced plans to acquire the game division of Pokémon Go developer Niantic. The PIF had an existing stake in EA before its full acquisition of the company.</p><p>The second company is Silver Lake, a multi-billion-dollar global technology investment firm based in North America, Europe, and Asia. Lastly, Affinity Partners is a Miami-based investment firm founded in 2021 by Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, who once served as White House senior advisor during Trump's first term.</p><p>The Consortium states it will “bring deep sector experience, committed capital, and global portfolios with networks across gaming, entertainment, and sports that offer unique possibilities for EA to blend physical and digital experiences, enhance fan engagement, and create new growth opportunities.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While there’s a new film in the Jurassic World series full of smuggling, foolhardy families, and Scarlett Johansson, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> takes a little more inspiration from its celluloid predecessor, Jurassic World Dominion, sticking with the dinosaur conservation angle. It’s this that really lends itself best to building parks and attractions around the world. The aim of the campaign is to build a more interconnected network of parks, bouncing back and forth between locations as you make new discoveries and research groundbreaking technologies.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Yx9J3T6gT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The core experience should be immediately familiar to players of the first two games, and to fans of Frontier’s other park management games –&nbsp;though there’s generally less biting in Planet Coaster 2 –&nbsp;and managing your park will be a steady diet of placing enclosures, sending expeditions off to dig sites to find new species, breeding them, tailoring their habitats, and trying to figure out how to make money from the visitors to your park.</p>


<p>Chatting with Jurassic World Evolution 3 Creative Director Andy Fletcher, he told us, “Jurassic World Evolution 3, in many ways, it sort of combines a lot of the best things that we loved about the first two games. You know, there’s some things that we’ve kind of harked back to in the first game – the main campaign’s a bit a bit less linear, so there’s a bit more freedom there, but it’s really, the impetus behind TWE3 was some of the big, big new features that we wanted to add to the series. So, you know, the advent of dinosaur families and the complete overhaul of the park construction tools, those are the real drivers behind this game. ”</p>
<p>One of the delights for dinosaur fans is how each new film and game brings new dinosaurs into the mix. Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a selection of newcomers like the Lokiceratops and Utahraptor, but perhaps more notable is the addition of dinosaur breeding and juvenile dinos that need to mature into adults.</p>


<p>I put it to Andy that this is maybe a doubling of the number of dinosaurs, but he pointed out that it’s beyond that, as there’s male dinos now as well and “they’ve got like crests and they’ve got like frills, they’ve got an entirely new patterns on them… so yeah, there’s a fair bit of work put in to make sure that male and female are different too. Some have bigger body masses. There’s lots there.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to go sort of deeper on the dinosaurs. Rather than just add more, it was about what really takes that element of the gameplay to the next level, when it’s the introduction of family units and the dynamics that come with that. How do the parents behave around the juveniles? How many juveniles want a certain number of other juveniles want in the herd? What happens when the juvenile T. Rex grows up, and wants to be an alpha male? You’ve got to go back in and manage that potentially chaotic situation. So it was just a really fruitful area to explore.”</p>
<p>So how do you get a baby dino now? Well, obviously the way you get a baby dinosaur is to find a mummy dinosaur and a daddy dinosaur who love each other very much, but as you start the game, you’ve only really got the technology and the DNA strands for all the female engineered dinos that stemmed from the founding of the original Jurassic Park.</p>

<p>Cabot Finch’s latest start-up is the DIN (Dinosaur Integration Network), bringing in the familiar voice of Dr Ian Malcolm for some sardonic advice, alongside a cast of other scientists and researchers. “It would kind of make sense that he might sort of do a start up of this nature,” Andy quipped about Cabot’s ongoing role. “You know, he’s a well meaning character, but he’s ambitious and demanding, and he makes for a really fun kind of boss, effectively, who you are trying to satisfy and trying to please.”</p>
<p>One of the first missions you have in the story is to go and research some genetically engineered male dinosaurs, create them in your labs, and then introduce them into the herds, groups and enclosures. Get everything in the right sweet spot and you’ll get little reports of nests with dinosaur eggs in them that can hatch naturally to have little dinos start bounding around getting into trouble. They can also, of course, be captured from the wild and brought to your park and enclosures as a family unit.</p>
<p>Juvenile dinos, and their parents, can start to have some different demands and behaviours as a consequence of this. Andy explained, “The paleo needs are usually quite similar, but someone was mentioning earlier that they released a a some juvenile Sauropod and they were like, “oh, this needs food that’s lower down, when its giant parents were eating them from the tree top.” So, you know, that’s quite an obvious example compared to adults need more space and things like that.</p>
<p>“It’s more in the social needs. It’s more in how paternal are the parents? How much do they are they going to sort of, how many juveniles do they want in their herd? So that’s where we’ve tried to kind of change the either partly on the diet and navigation as well.”</p>
<p>“That’s another dimension, because we have semiaquatic dinosaurs now, but there’s an interesting example of one of the semi-aquatics that where the adult can swim across deep water, the juvenile can’t, so you’ve gotta kind of think about how do I manage that enclosure if I’ve use deep water disclosure?”</p>

<p>I’m really keen to see how deep this system goes in the full game, while still trying to keep things intelligible for the typical player –&nbsp;I have enough trouble figuring out the specifics of what my cat wants, so dealing with teenage raptor mood swings might be a bit much!</p>
<p>And if this style of dino breeding really isn’t your thing, then you’ll still have the ability to wave your scientific magical wand to incubate dinos at your hatcheries, and a Marketplace Facility will let you simply purchase animals. Just note that sellers have a degree of trustworthiness, and you may come across a dinosaur deal that’s a bit too good to be true.</p>
<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 gives you a lot more control over the look and layout of your park, completely overhauling the terrain tools to be a bit more fluid and flexible. It’s this that Andy would highlight as his favourite new feature – surprisingly it’s not the raptor chasing a goat on the loading screen.</p>
<p>“I think my favourite feature is the overhaul of the environmental tools that basically your ability to form terrain so that it’s really satisfying to use. You don’t have to be super creative to do something quick and fun, that feels good, and that is really impactful on the park.”</p>

<p>He continued, “When you go to put down a building, it’s just the same as it ever was, it’s exactly the same number of presses it ever was – I counted. But you’ve got this new area where you can go and explore custom creations, you can you can custom create this particular building from scratch, if you like, and get involved in that section if you want to.</p>
<p>“It’s all about kind of nesting that complexity of the features so that you can kind of always dive down deeper, but if you just want to enjoy the fruits of it all you can stay at that top level.”</p>
<p>On the surface level, it does have the same immediacy and feel as previous Jurassic World Evolution games, but now there’s more types of ground manipulation brushes to give different effects. One of those is to create waterfalls, placing water at the top of a mountain and then pushing pool from a lower level to get the gravity to do its thing. You can also, as Andy pointed out to me, create natural enclosures out the terrain.</p>

<p>It’s a good enhancement, but, as I always find with 3D terrain manipulation tools, it still takes a bit of getting used to with fairly wide brushes to paint not always giving me the precision I wanted, and the intensity and slope metrics to handle. It’s a similar way to how you have to juggle the various terrain and foliage types in an enclosure, getting the right balance in grass for pasture taking away from the muddy swamp that they might also want some of.</p>
<p>It’s lovely to have Frontier continuing to grow their prehistoric park manager, and Jurassic World Evolution 3 looks to be hitting a lot of fan-pleasing notes. Revamped terrain tools, alongside blueprints and sharing, and then the impressive introduction of juvenile dinos and family units, and a broader world-spanning campaign will all go down like a live goat to a T. Rex.</p>

<p>We'll miss you, friend</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's always difficult to say goodbye to someone, and today we bid farewell to our lovely, <em>lovely</em> video producer Zion Grassl, who is leaving Nintendo Life for pastures new.</p>
<p>Zion joined us all the way back in 2019, and helped our YouTube channel grow exponentially as we navigated the world of the Nintendo Switch. His enthusiasm and infectious passion for all things Nintendo really struck a chord with our viewers, and we're incredibly sad to see him go.</p>
<p>He leaves us with some truly incredible videos, including the hugely ambitious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsuFsGwpJgs">'I Tried 3DS StreetPass For 365 Days'</a>, the hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglKld20Hic">'The MOTHER We Share'</a> documentary, and the delightfully ridiculous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">'I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art'</a>. We simply cannot put a price on Zion's remarkable contributions to the channel, and we're certain that wherever he ends up next, he'll go on to do even greater things.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I (yes, me, Ollie) am incredibly grateful for Zion's friendship over the years. His presence during my first trip to LA for Summer Game Fest was immensely comforting, and it made the trip infinitely more enjoyable. He truly is one of the most caring, uplifting spirits you could ever hope to meet, and I'm proud to call him my friend.</p>
<p>So from me, and from all of us here at Nintendo Life, we wish Zion the very best of luck. If you want to keep up with his work, you can find him on socials under the handle @ZionDood. In the meantime, please do continue to support the wonderful work that Alex and Felix continue to do over on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nintendolife">YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Love you, Zion!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159228/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're a long-time fan or just curious, it’s natural to approach the release of a new JRPG with measured expectations. These games often build on rich lore and deep series history, rewarding those who enjoy exploring vast worlds and narratives. On the surface, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> might seem like just another drop in the genre ocean, especially since it belongs to <strong>The Legend of Heroes</strong>, where the Trails cycle alone spans 13 games. However, this reboot benefits from the clean narrative slate of a series opener and a generous modernisation that will appeal to fans and newcomers across the board. This may be the beginning of a long remake series, but it’s a hell of an intro.</p>
<p>The story takes place in Liberl, a technologically advanced region of a much larger world. Here we meet two siblings, who are beginning their training as freelance guardians of the land. Estelle and Joshua are engaging dual protagonists; their endearing relationship and playful bickering are the heart of the story. As they rise through the ranks of a peacekeeping force called the Bracers, they are joined by a huge cast of characters and a constantly shifting roster of party members. There are too many to list here, but aside from the Bright siblings, I was especially fond of the musical fop Oliviere (voiced by Matt Mercer in the English audio track).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159239/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Liberl feels like a living, breathing world, with bustling population centres and NPC dialogue that shifts based on the story's events. Dialogue choices offer a sense of narrative agency and it always feels worth chatting up locals when you frequent a town. In true JRPG fashion, the story takes a while to really breathe (you can easily spend a dozen hours in the prologue), but there is plenty to do from the outset, so you won’t be stuck in stop-start dialogue or endless tutorials.</p>
<p>There will be many an info screen in the opening hours, however, largely thanks to a pleasingly complex battle system. As trainee Bracers, Estelle and Joshua spend much of their time completing missions that pit them against a wide variety of monsters. Fighting the fauna of Liberl is both flexible and accessible. While the systems on offer aren’t unique, the sheer number of options available to your party keeps combat exciting.</p>
<p>Ability sets are built using a slotting system called Quartz, crafted from a material known as Sepith. These materials drop from enemies in several types, and combining them to fill gear slots unlocks different spells and abilities. Beyond quartz-based magic, your party also has a suite of melee and ranged techniques that can be chained, overcharged, and combined for devastating critical damage. Each party member has utility and can support their companions with elemental boosts.</p>

<p>Combat can play out in real time or switch to a queue-based tactical variant. Most battles will require the strategic turn-based mode, while traversing the open world is a breeze with the real-time system.</p>
<p>It takes some time to get comfortable with the options at your disposal, but once it all clicks the fighting is a blast. For anyone familiar with the series, these mechanics are a mix of ideas from earlier entries, which is just part of the modern overhaul this remake provides.</p>
<p>Falcom’s update shifts the perspective away from an isometric, polygonal style to a fully animated 3D Liberl. The world is bright and colourful, while combat feels fluid and looks spectacular. The industry may currently lean in favour of remasters, but this is a ground-up remake with some generous quality-of-life updates included.</p>

<p>Newly recorded Japanese and English audio tracks are solid, though the Japanese voices edge out their counterparts thanks to some especially endearing performances, particularly Tomoyo Takayanagi as Estelle. On the music side, the option to switch between three different suites is a welcome addition. The arranged option is particularly stunning.</p>
<p>As for gameplay, high-speed mode will be a blessing for returning players and a boon for anyone looking to grind XP without the drag. Difficulty settings cover a wide spectrum, from casual mode to the punishing nightmare, a series staple that makes its return here.</p>
<p>The game releases on both Switch 1 and 2, with a cheap upgrade pack for those that might invest in the new console at a later date. Performance-wise, the original Switch outputs in a noticeable 30fps with an impact to the quality when compared to its big brother. The journey of our sibling Bracers is most impressive on Switch 2, which targets 60fps.</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159235/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Undocked is notably the best mode and runs with what feels like flawless stability in combat and wandering the open world. Docked is also strong, but there is the odd frame hiccup in population centres and during visually busy battles. The game isn’t a visual powerhouse by any means, but it’s nice to see the characters adventure through lovingly designed environments without any compromises on the newer console.</p>
<p>1st Chapter is an exciting start to what may become a successful series of remakes. Its engaging, emergent story and wealth of charming characters deserve to be experienced anew or discovered for the first time. Most of all, it revitalised my love affair with JRPGs, a saturated genre of which this feels like a refreshing new high-water mark.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a comprehensive audio-visual update of a classic series opener, with great characters, a world that you’ll want to explore, and deep combat with a wealth of options. The updated style runs best on Switch 2, with only the odd stumble in docked performance.</p></section>

Based on time of day and year, global fertility rates, and our own secret, illegal research into RPS supporter breeding patterns, I calculate that there's a 12% chance you are reading this while carrying or cradling a small child. If that's the case, then: what on Earth are you doing here? We post all kinds of awful grown-up things on RPS. Mark is threatening to do another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">salacious mod article</a> and just this very morning, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-final-fantasy-tactics-vr-free-alien-wooden-mice-mazes-and-opulent-card-games">posted</a> a picture of a xenomorph covered in blood. 
</p>
<p>
This piece should be safe for kids, however, as long as you don't explain what a xenomorph is or what "salacious" means. It's about Messenger, a free browser-based game in which you run around a very small 3D watercolour planet, delivering post. I suspect you and your child will enjoy it, unless we've already corrupted them and you're now playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aliens-fireteam">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Created using WebGL, Messenger is from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">Short Hike</a> school of vibes-driven pocket worlds with gentle to-do lists. The controls consist of moving with WASD and jumping - more of a lazy hop, really - with space bar. You've got a few deliveries to make off the bat, and you can take on more assignments by chatting to people.

The dialogue writing is quite spry. I delivered a letter to a bald man which turned out to be from his past self. "Take care of your hair," it read. Sad trombone. You don't really need an objective, mind: it's enough just to amble down the road and watch the horizon unroll. There's also the option of customising your outfit, and an emoji system for communicating with the other players - yes, those are other players! - who pop into your session at random.
</p><p>
<a href="https://messenger.abeto.co/">Find Messenger here</a>. Try not to get it confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-the-messenger"><em>The</em> Messenger</a>, an upsettingly hard game about ninjas. It's kind of ridiculous that this kind of game now hums along in a browser, isn't it? Imagine that it's 2000 and you found this on AOL - your head would asplode. Your modem would probably asplode, as well. "Asplode" is a reference to noted early noughties comedy website <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a>, by the way - your kid likely isn't old enough for Strongbad yet, but it's the kind of thing they'll love when they start school. Better than the rest of the junk you find on those modern videophones, anyway.
</p>
<p>
Among the mysteries of Messenger is who exactly made it. The creators are Abeto, who "craft interactive realtime experiences", and have <a href="https://abeto.co/">a picturesque, tastefully information-free website</a> where you can wave away the petals that fall from a perpetually unfurling flower. Please don't let this be a front for a seedy cryptocurrency joint, or a terrible data-harvesting exercise of some kind. Please let it just be a nice game about roaming a pleasant spherical suburb.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When we look back on 2025, we might remember it as the Year of the Mini PC. These mighty mites broke out in a huge way this year, with powerful and fast new models flooding the market and putting to rest the idea that the mini PC is no more than an amusing toy. Virtually all of these new-breed mini PCs have pushed the productivity and work angle as their selling point, but now the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC has arrived, combining serious processing and graphics power essential for PC gaming with the ultra-compact body that has made the mini PC such a hot item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">There’s a limited-time 27% off deal on the BOSGAME P3 at Amazon right now which gives you the chance to shrink your gaming rig smaller than you ever thought possible, and do it for just $400.</a> With the P3 running the show, your gaming station can now fit three massive 4K gaming monitors and your specialized keyboard, mouse, and controller while the PC at the heart of the system is tucked behind one of those monitors, delivering top-level performance while remaining unseen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming PC, Not a Toy</h2>
<p>The old-school thought that these fun-sized desktop PCs are mere curiosities and toys that could never possibly compete with a full-sized rig is just that — old school. Beneath its teeny hood the P3 packs an 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 processor with a top speed of 5.1GHz, more than enough to keep you in the game even during a fast-action first-person shooter or battle royal game.</p>
<p>There’s also 32GB of RAM built in, along with a fat 1TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD. And while you certainly would not guess it from looking at this palm-sized PC, you can expand that RAM to 64GB, and there’s even a vacant NVMe PCIe slot available for you to max out the storage.</p>



<h2>Fast, Smooth Graphics</h2>
<p>And, yes, we did say three huge 4K gaming monitors, because the P3 can support them all with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C ports at the ready. The AMD Radeon 780M graphics chip is able to keep up with the fastest and most visually detailed games without lag or glitching. And whether you go with the Wi-Fi6E connection, the Bluetooth 5.2 one, or either of the two Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 ports for hardwired online gaming, you will never be lacking in speed.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before a mini PC for gamers hit the market, and when you look at the prices of those enormous rigs with the fancy neon lighting and clear panels showing the guts of the machine, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/">you’ll really be blown away by the $400 price tag on the BOSGAME P3 Mini Gaming PC that you’ll find right now at Amazon.</a> But, it’s only there for a limited time, so be as fast as the P3’s impressive processing and internet speed and get to Amazon now before it’s over.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
