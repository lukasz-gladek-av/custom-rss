But perhaps no title left us feeling more satisfied and accomplished than <em>Visions of Mana</em>, the first new mainline entry in Square Enix’s <em>Mana</em> series in over 15 years. Though August was a stacked month for video games and September looks to be just as strong, we urge you to make time for this emotionally and tonally complex RPG that’s well worth the hours it may take for you to settle into its story. And here’s every reason why.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-recommend-id="image://ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-notes="" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-recommend-id="image://ddb03a19a22a31e6f8d47483d3cb8488" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunny-like figure in purple smiles with its eyes closed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s no outfit in gaming with a stronger history of telling tales about picking fights with God than Square Enix. Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power. No, not <em>Dragon Quest</em>; yes, you visit churches to save in those games, but then you go and hang out in pubs and gamble like an exhausted salaryman. No, I’m talking about <em>Mana</em>. — Lucas White</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-review-square-enix-1851632322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-review-square-enix-1851632322">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5563e071700f9bed0866b0686ef2c5f2" data-recommend-id="image://5563e071700f9bed0866b0686ef2c5f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The almost unbearably bright colors of two Visions characters having a chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The almost unbearably bright colors of two Visions characters having a chat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5563e071700f9bed0866b0686ef2c5f2" data-recommend-id="image://5563e071700f9bed0866b0686ef2c5f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The almost unbearably bright colors of two Visions characters having a chat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> is a vibrant and charming role-playing game that harkens back to the classics many of us grew up enjoying, providing hours of enjoyable exploration, character customization, and storytelling.

		<p>While Formula 1 manages to hoover up almost all of the racing news headlines, it’s far from the only motorsporting peak for drivers to climb. Each one puts differing skills to the test, from the fearless adaptability needed for WRC, to the perfected turns and slipstreaming of NASCAR and IndyCar oval racing. Then there’s the endurance racing of WEC and IMSA, with the jewels in the crown of the 24 hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, each contested by multi-class fields of racing cars, with multiple drivers per car, and a gruelling test of stamina, skill and split-second judgement.</p>
<p>With Endurance Motorsport Series, KT Racing is seeking to capture the essence of these cars, with Hypercars, LMP2 and GT from a bunch of major manufacturers, the challenge of driving them for long periods of time through changeable conditions, but also of the race management that takes place on the pit wall.</p>
<p><iframe title="Endurance Motorsport Series | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-iZBTAKOGSI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Endurance Motorsport Series is a fairly unique game, in that respect, making it a distinctive alternative to Le Mans Ultimate (which is currently in Early Access), sim racing in rFactor 2, or jumping into long format races in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-motorsport">Forza Motorsport</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-cars-2">Project Cars 2</a>, and all the other racing games in history that have features Circuit de la Sarthe and other icons of this form of racing.</p>
<p>We got to go hands-on with a team running a pair of Porsche cars, with a shortened race at Fuji Speedway accelerating things like tyre wear, fuel usage and weather transitions to provide an indicative experience. Built using KT’s in-house KT Engine, it looks fantastic as you race in the shadow of Mt. Fuji, and as an ominous bank of rain rolls in to upend your race. Unfortunately, you’ll just have to trust me on this, as Nacon is yet to release any screenshots from this first-playable build of the game.</p>

<p>Driving both the Porsche 963 LMDh and a Porsche 911 GT3 R (992), and using Nacon’s upcoming RevoSim racing wheel, the base experience was definitely more on the accessible side of simcade racing, most likely with a bunch of racing assists turned on. That’s important for broad appeal, when this game is coming to consoles and PC, and will likely be very playable on a gamepad, but I’ve no doubt that you’ll be able to get a more exacting simulation if you desire one.</p>
<p>However, this game’s real trick is straddling the divide between driver and team manager. At any time you can switch views back to the pit wall and check on the overall progress of the race, check how conditions are changing, make the calls for the next round of pit stops, nudge the AI drivers to race in a particular way, ask them to provide feedback on the car to and diagnose issues, and more. While you’re able to hop in and out at any time, there is a driver line up of AI that will have their own particular driver stats and stamina for racing, oh, and when you personally head back on track, you don’t necessarily have to drive the car you started with, but can chop and change between the two.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly realistic to be able to do this, but Endurance Motorsport Series is perhaps more about capturing the spirit of the sport than any specific rules and regulations. Keen WEC fan that I am, I noticed minor details like pit stops replacing tyres and refuelling in the wrong order for that championship’s regulations and processes, though you can do things like swap only certain tyres if wear is affecting your car unevenly, or mixing and matching different compounds on different parts of the car.</p>
<p>Endurance Motorsport Series is a fascinating prospect that is trying something a bit different and with a style of racing that is decidedly niche, but that’s a big part of its appeal. If you’ve even a little love for endurance racing, this is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads for release in 2025, and I’m keen to see more.</p>

		<p>Nacon is a pretty familiar brand to gamers, not just for the games that they publish, but for the wealth of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/07/nacon-revolution-5-pro-controller-review-ps5/">pro controllers</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/">headsets</a>, keyboards, and more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/22/nacon-daija-arcade-stick-ps5-review/">niche gaming interests</a> they cater to. But as broad as their gaming accessory range has become, there’s still some areas that they haven’t catered to. With the Revosim Pure, they will be drifting into the high-end racing wheel market, which has become increasingly competitive in the last few years.</p>
<p>Just as the racing game genre has skewed further toward sim racing over the last generation, the racing wheel market has also gone far more premium. There’s still brands catering to the £100-200 range with entry-level wheels, but with the advent of direct-drive wheel bases, load-cell pedals and other more advanced tech than basic belts, gears and springs, you’re looking at spending well over £500. I’m not even talking about a fully customised and kitted out Fanatec, Simucube, Moza or Simagic set up, but perhaps one of £500-700 Fanatec’s entry bundles (which vary wildly depending on platform support) or a £1000 Logitech G Pro.</p>



<p>Nacon hasn’t announced a price yet or a launch window for their wheel, but the Revosim Pure is starting off as an all-in-one bundle that will happily match the features of the rest of the market. The included wheelbase comes in the tight, boxy style of all direct drive bases on the market, and is capable of a hefty 9 Nm of force feedback – not market-leading, but still plenty powerful to make the wheel spin frighteningly fast if you crash.</p>
<p>Attached to that is, of course, the wheel. It’s an all-rounder, a 30cm circular wheel that’s appropriate for road cars, but if all you race is virtual GT3 cars and Formula 1, it’s not the same. Still, there’s a decent set of 12 buttons, including a directional toggles and system buttons, and a built-in strip of rev limiter lights. This is set to be the starter wheel for the Revosim lineup, with an aluminium quick release system that connects the wheel to the base and metal gear shift paddles, and the company able to release those more specific wheel styles and motorsports replicas down the line.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it’s a good sized wheel with a nice imitation leather effect on it, and will be immediately familiar-feeling under hand.</p>

<p>One particular quirk that’s interesting is the ability to clip a smartphone to the base, running the Revosim app to quickly configure wheel settings and to act as a dashboard for compatible games –&nbsp;you’d bet that anything KT Racing produces will support this feature.</p>
<p>Down by your feet, the included two-pedal set is made of aluminium for long-term durability, and with plenty of high-end features and adjustability. The pedals use hall effect sensors to track pedal positioning, and there’s a 100kg load sensor for the pedal brake, with three sets of three elastomer spacers to let you customise how stiff or squishy you want the pedal to be. Even the softest is pretty tough to squish in hand, but the hardest could almost just be a solid plastic block. Of course, once you’re stamping down with your leg, they’re subject to an awful lot more pressure, and being able to mix and match these sets will let players get the brake feel they want.</p>

<p>Again, there’s modularity and flexibility here for the future. It’s designed for a third pedal, for anyone that wants a clutch pedal, but also the ability to adjust pedal angles to match both the game your playing, and whether or not you’ve attached it to a desk or into a racing wheel frame.</p>
<p>Playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/01/endurance-motorsport-series-preview-a-gentleman-driver-and-a-scholarly-engineer/">Endurance Motorsport Series</a> with the wheel, everything felt intuitive and exactly as I expected it to. It’s clearly a high-end direct drive set from the quality of the force feedback I was getting, and it was satisfying to stamp down on the brakes, trying to draw the car back down in speed to make a corner.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the Revosim Pure just seems to be a nice all-round basis for Nacon to build out their racing wheel range from, and a solid alternative to the big names already in the racing wheel market.</p>

			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 update, which has a lot of fans hyped up, is set to debut on PC in the first week of September, as revealed by Larian at PAX West.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-gets-more-details-ahead-of-its-september-launch-wont-be-the-final-update/">upcoming Update 7</a> on BG3 is expected to feature several changes, chiefly the introduction of official mod support. PC players have been able to enjoy <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods-expand-party-size-unlock-level-cap-add-spells-feats-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial mods</a> since the game's early access, but now tools to make better mods will be available, and eventually, mods are coming to consoles, too. Larian CEO Swen Vincke said at PAX West:</p>
<p><em>Our goal is to do cross-platform modding support. It's not the easiest thing in the world because we have to make it work on consoles and on PC. We'll start with the PC version, while the console version will come a bit later because it has to go through a bunch of submission processes. It also gives us the time to see whatever goes wrong and fix it so we get everything right for consoles.</em></p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you missed it, Patch 7 is coming to PC next week!</p>
<p>With so many changes and new features arriving in this patch, it’ll take a little longer to get these to you on console and Mac - but don’t worry, you’ll be murdering your enemies and installing mods in no time. <a href="https://t.co/G7DzctYwKk">pic.twitter.com/G7DzctYwKk</a></p>

<p>However, the most anticipated change among fans is the inclusion of detailed cinematics of evil endings for every Origin character. Fortunately, we now have an idea of when Baldur's Gate 3 next big patch will be released, and according to Larian's Studio Head, Swen Vincke, fans can expect it to drop in the first week of September.</p>
<p>While the upcoming patch is said to bring several new in-game content, <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-mod-tools-dark-endings-end-of-story-content/">beta testers</a> have apparently shown resentment toward the new evil endings included by Larian, particularly with Wyll, since it is claimed that the developers presented an ending similar to an Evil Tav (the name for custom characters in Baldur's Gate 3) except for the addition of a few dialogues.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m hearing talk that Wyll’s ‘evil’ ending is just an Evil Tav ending with a few lines of dialogue switched to make it related to Wyll. </p>
<p>My thoughts on that and Larian’s treatment of Wyll since release would probably lock my account.</p>
<p>— “Taters.” | Rhi | She/Her (@InfernalTaters) <a href="https://twitter.com/InfernalTaters/status/1828455018346709485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we won't go much into the information, users across Reddit and social forums had a heated debate on Update 7's beta, arguing that Larian downplayed Wyll's influence while giving Astarion the priority here. To back this statement up, it is said that Astarion has gained 12 hours and 45 minutes of footage, while Wyll has received just 8 hours. Users claim that Update 7 is more of a "strategic move" by Larian, given that Astarion has seen immense popularity among the fans out there, so the developer decided to make the best out of this.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As an Astarion/Wyll fan: I'm tired of seeing Astarion getting the most content out of the rest of the companions, particularly Wyll</p>
<p>Wyll's story being connected to the main story, yet having the least amount of content and having unfixed bugs for 1+ years, is... weird??</p>
<p>— Zero (@bhaalbxbe) <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaalbxbe/status/1828857581130895769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We still have to wait to see exactly what Update 7 brings. Right now, it's just a guessing game for everyone since Larian has promised several changes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4240783699885624491">community update</a>. Fortunately, the wait isn't long at this point.</p>

            <p>Space Goblin Studio - an indie team with "AAA credentials" - has revealed its debut game, Astrobotanica, is set to release in early access in 2025.</p>
<p>Delivering a "unique blend of survival, exploration, and plant wizardry", Astrobotanica is described as a "lush open-world survival adventure" that "transports players to prehistoric Earth, where an alien botanist crash-lands while searching for plant species to save their dying home planet, Aya".</p>
<p>You can see it in action in the teaser below:</p>

<p>The team - which comprises devs who've worked on Dead Island and Dying Light - "plans to closely engage with gamers in further development, to ensure relevance and playability while delivering a bigger, meaningful message" as players cultivate, research, and experiment with plant species that could thrive on Aya.</p>
<p>"Astrobotanica is a game we've always wanted to play," said Arkadiusz Woźniak, founder of Space Goblin Studio.</p>
<p>"I hope to bring new life to the survival genre by combining innovative gameplay with familiar themes. With gamers' support, I’m sure we will craft Astrobotanica into a remarkable title, while working towards future co-op."</p>
<p>Right now, the launch is limited to early access on Steam only, and its release window is currently a pretty vague "2025".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/streamers-return-twitch-from-youtube/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamers-return-to-twitch-as-youtube-exclusivity-contracts-expire.969582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/streamers-return-twitch-from-youtube/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Many big-name streamers have returned to Twitch after breaks as long as three years as their exclusivity contracts expire on YouTube. In recent hours, the likes of TimTheTatman, Dr Lupo, and Swagg have all announced their return to Twitch as avenues into multistreaming-based opportunities open up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-home">Back Home</h2>



<p>Per the chatter on social platforms, Google is reluctant to offer exclusivity contracts and is leaning more heavily into short-form content, the type that has made TikTok such a popular app. This has meant that many top-tier creators aren’t having their exclusivity contracts extended, which in turn means they’re free to stream on other platforms.</p>



<p>To that end, Tim, Lupo, and Swagg have all kicked off streams on Twitch after lengthy breaks away from the super-sized streaming site.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year or two for Twitch, least of all because of the rise of competing platforms like YouTube and Kick. The platform has dealt with mass layoffs, controversies, and dissent within the streaming community as it navigates an ever-changing market and audience.</p>



<p>While many streamers have made a return to Twitch, and assumedly some are yet to follow, they’re not <strong>exclusive </strong>to the site. It’s believed that Amazon is just as reluctant to hand out exclusivity contracts and is perfectly satisfied with multistreaming content creators broadcasting shared streams on their platform.</p>



<p>Considering exclusivity contracts can number in the tens of millions of dollars, it’s a wise decision all around.</p>



<p>Who are you waiting to return to Twitch?</p>

            <p>New gameplay footage from Slitterhead has dropped from PAX West, and once again, Slitterhead is <em>really</em> emphasising the fact you can play as a dog.</p>
<p>We first got a good look at Bokeh Studio's Slitterhead last summer when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p>

<p>Now, Gematsu has shared three videos of footage taken at PAX West (one is embedded above; the other two can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZg1p87fJHM">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrL4dzpSp_0">here</a>), which give us a better look at how The Spirit moves around the world, slipping from person to person (or dog to person, as the case may be), as well as its dark, detailed urban environments.</p>
<p>There are also some super interesting chase sequences (albeit with a little twist) and delightfully grim enemy designs (is it me, or does one look like Beetlejuice?). It should be familiar to anyone who spent time with the Siren games back in the day.</p>
<p>We also get a better peek at the combat, too, and how The Spirit can move from person to person, even in the middle of a fight.</p>
<p>If the sight of blood makes you a little woozy, though, you may want to give these a miss.</p>
<p>Slitterhead will release on 8th November 2024 for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scump-best-jackal-loadout-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/scump%E2%80%99s-best-jackal-pdw-loadout-for-cod-kings-is-here.969561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/scump-best-jackal-loadout-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner is one of the most recognisable Call of Duty pro players of all time. He has amassed millions of followers over a ten-year career that has spanned a dozen Call of Duty games. Recently, he has been enjoying the Black Ops 6 beta and has taken the time to outline his best Jackal PDW loadout, reserved exclusively for the best COD players in the business.</p>



<p>I’m kidding, of course – but <strong>using </strong>Scump’s Jackal build might help you to become one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-jackal-pdw-loadout-from-a-cod-champion">Best Jackal PDW Loadout From a COD Champion</h2>



<p>Scump has been tearing up Black Ops 6 since the beta went live, streaming for hours on end and snapping some incredible clips. His in-game skill is going the distance in proving why he’s considered the king of Call of Duty esports, and even though he has now retired from competing, he’s still capable of breaking ankles.</p>



<p>Here’s Scump’s Jackal loadout in Black Ops 6:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle – </strong>Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel – </strong>Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine </strong>– Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip – </strong>CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock – </strong>Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>But what about the best perks to use with the Jackal?</p>



<p>Scump has opted to use the Perk Greed wildcard, synching up with Ghost, Dexterity, Double Time, and Gung-Ho. His ‘speciality’ is Enforcer. He has long been able to rack up huge kill counts in Call of Duty, and that’s where this Jackal build shines. </p>



<p>With the extended magazine, Scump can keep tossing lead downrange, and the other attachments are mostly designed to provide as low recoil as possible. For maximum run and gun action, pair up this Jackal loadout with an Assault Pack field upgrade to stay topped up.</p>

Super Mario Bros 3? Perhaps it’s Mega-Man 2, or The Legend of Zelda? There’s almost certainly no definitive answer to the single best game on the console, but what If I told you one of its greatest games was one that not only shattered the perception of what you could achieve on the NES, but was also a game you’ve (probably) never heard of? </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/gimmick-carts-1724853943733.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Original Gimmick! (known as Mr. Gimmick in Sweden) packaging.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Gimmick!, developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft, was a Nintendo Entertainment System masterpiece. But despite critical acclaim – including praise from industry legends Shigeru Miyamoto and Masahiro Sakurai – it was almost immediately forgotten, in no small part thanks to the fact it was only ever released in Japan and one small Scandinavian pocket of the West. Despite its obscurity, though, one Swedish fan not only loved Gimmick!, he obsessed over it. This was more than a mere hobby, too, as he set up his own studio with the lifelong goal of creating the sequel Gimmick! deserved and finally exposing it to the world.</p><p>But the journey wasn’t easy. From being laughed out of a pitch meeting to mass layoffs threatening the studio’s existence, the path to Gimmick! 2 has been as tricky as its notoriously difficult predecessor. </p><p>This is the Inside Story of Gimmick!, the greatest forgotten NES game and its unexpected 2024 sequel. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-1-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite its relative obscurity, Gimmick! <em>is</em> appreciated. It’s regularly mentioned in top lists by hardcore NES enthusiasts and original copies trade on eBay for ungodly amounts of money. Iconic Nintendo game director Shigeru Miyamoto said it was “fun”, extremely high praise from someone who rarely (if at all) praises other people’s games. Kirby and Super Smash Bros visionary Masahiro Sakurai has been even more enthusiastic, saying Gimmick! was “a technical marvel”.</p><p>But what is it about Gimmick! that’s so revered? Why do hardcore fans and industry legends worship a game about a green, star-throwing blob called Yumetaro?</p><p>“It just did a lot of things to stand out,” says Illusory Wall, a Dark Souls YouTuber and huge fan of Gimmick! “It was offering an experience that was unique.” That uniqueness was exemplified by Gimmick!’s star mechanic, a charged projectile that also could serve as a platform to jump off – a rare feature by even today’s standards, but in 1992 it was revolutionary.</p><p>“I can’t think of another platformer on the NES that has anything close to the mechanics of this game,” says Pat the NES Punk, retro Nintendo enthusiast, YouTuber and Gimmick! obsessive. “What’s amazing about the star attack is that it’s based seemingly on realistic physics. It deflects off objects and enemies, it bounces and dissipates.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I firmly believe that Gimmick! would always be on anyone’s top 5 NES game had it been released beyond Japan and Scandinavia.</p></div><p>Gimmick! was more than its star mechanic, though. Not only was it a tight, colourful, and fun platformer equal to many of its peers, but Gimmick! also set new standards for variety and detail. In an era where Super Mario games constantly reused sprites and tile sets, Gimmick! was full of environmental diversity. Each level was unique and also loaded with bespoke one-off moments; moments that often weren’t required, but just added an unprecedented level of depth to each space.  </p><p>“There’s these two sprites at the beginning of level six that don’t exist anywhere else in the game and it’s basically a guy playing with his dog,” explains Illusory Wall. “The dog gets excited for you holding onto the star, it treats it like you’re holding onto a ball – It’ll wag its tail and come after you. The guy is tepid, he doesn’t want to be in your business. The fact that they’re not even trying to attack you adds an extra layer. They feel like these living creatures in the game, they’re not just obstacles.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/guy-and-dog-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"enemy" walking his dog.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“In the second stage, you can knock over the spiny turtle enemy. If you then jump on the legs of the character it’ll kick you in the opposite direction, it’s realistically pushing you off the enemy,” explains Pat the NES Punk. ”There’s no gameplay reason for that to exist in the game. It’s just a cute little touch that other games [of the era] wouldn’t have.”</p><p>Gimmick! is jam-packed with these moments. Its second level even features a Metal Gear Solid-like moment where the end-level boss can be found asleep if you reach him too quickly. Each level is full of detail reserved for only the most ambitious games of today. “I firmly believe that Gimmick! would always be on [anyone’s] top 5 NES game had it been released [beyond Japan and Scandinavia]” claims Pat the NES Punk.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/boss-is-asleep-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sleeping boss on Stage 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Gimmick! fans know it’s special, but despite being a critical hit, the game never reached an audience large enough to gain commercial success. Gimmick! (or Mr. Gimmick! in Sweden) was never released outside of Japan and Sweden. And even in the two countries where it did make it to shelves, its availability was limited. So much so that many of the Swedish developers working on the sequel hadn’t heard of it before they joined the project.</p><p>“I first heard of Gimmick! through a Swedish retro gaming YouTube channel,” says Olof Karlsson, Lead Programmer on Gimmick! 2. ”I grew up playing Nintendo games, and I never played Gimmick! It's like Kirby's Adventure in the quality level, except that no one really knows about it. How?”</p><p>So why was Gimmick!, despite its apparent quality, never widely released in the West? Perhaps it arrived too late into the NES’s lifecycle, or was an unfortunate victim of cost-saving measures. According to Sunsoft’s former vice president of development in America, David Siller, the company's managers felt the game's characters were too "strange or quirky". For a game aimed at children, this – paired with the elevated difficulty level – perhaps didn’t present well for its target audience. That’s right, Gimmick! Is hard. <em>REALLY </em>hard.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Despite its cute looks Gimmick! is more of a Castlevania than a Kirby.</p></div><p>“It's a game that looks cute and colourful – probably most analogous to Kirby on the NES. But Kirby was more reasonable to get through,” explains Illusory Wall. “Despite its cute looks [Gimmick! is] more of a Castlevania than a Kirby.”</p><p>“The difficulty of Mr. Gimmick was one of its advertising features,” recalls Pat the NES Punk. In fact, an ominous warning was even on the back of the original box: <em>“Every game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You’ll call on many skills, techniques and tricks you’ve learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive the evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive and only the very best will experience the secret ending.” </em></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/back-of-the-box-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite the positive critical reception Gimmick has received over time, its inevitable lack of commercial success never presented an opportunity for a sequel. Gimmick!, like many forgotten gems of its era, faded into obscurity, with Sunsoft leaving Yumetaro to gather decades worth of dust. 30 years later, though, one hardcore Swedish fan had different ideas…</p><p>“I didn't own Gimmick!, I [only] played it at a friend's house, but I truly remember the characters in the game. They were so much alive compared to [other] games,” says Niklas Istenes, the CEO and founder of Bitwave Games and creator of Gimmick! 2. “[Later on] when I started to collect games I finally bought the cart and I remembered I loved it. I watched speedruns, I watched people highlighting the secrets, I was so intrigued by how many details there are in this game. It was my go-to title when people came over and saw my retro collection. I always brought out my Gimmick! [cartridge] first.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/nik-retro-1724853943733.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Niklas Istenes, CEO and founder of Bitwave Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It’s clear that Istenes is a super fan of Gimmick!, and that was reinforced when IGN visited the Gimmick!-filled Bitwave office in February of 2023. But the dots still needed connecting. How had this small, Swedish developer –- who at the time had only released one game called Pictoparty on the Wii U – been allowed to create the sequel to a forgotten, Japanese, Nintendo cult classic?</p><p>“I had no idea if Sunsoft was still around, maybe they're bankrupt or something?” shares Istenes. “Maybe they don't care anymore about their old IPs? So I wrote… not even a pitch, it was more of like, ’Hey, do you still have this IP? We're interested in doing a sequel. What's the royalty cost, yada, yada, yada.’”</p><p>“My proposition was around $10,000. They're like, ‘No, that's small fry for us. You're a nobody. You made a party game on Wii U. No way you're getting one of our most cherished IPs.’ I don't know what I expected. It was a shot in the dark.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The vision of my company was to do the sequel Gimmick!, so that's what I pitched.</p></div><p>Istenes’ attempt was bold and certainly naive. He explained that Bitwave Games (previously known as Retroid Interactive) was built on a foundation of his love for Gimmick!. He would often wax lyrical about the forgotten platformer to his colleagues, and now it appeared his dream of making a sequel was now dead. But a few years later, right in the eye of the Covid pandemic storm - an event that threatened the studio's very survival -  there was a glimmer of hope…</p><p>“It was a very low period, and there was a lot of talk of whether we should just close down" recalls Istenes. “I didn't know what I was supposed to do. So I reached out to a friend called Martin Lindell. Martin came back and he was like, ‘I started at Embracer. Could you pitch your company to us?’ The vision of my company was to do the sequel Gimmick!, so that's what I pitched.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/doohickey-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Embracer Group is a large Swedish game licensing company that, at one time, was making an unfathomable number of acquisitions, Bitwave being one of them. Embracer not only liked what Bitwave had to offer, but was on board with trying to get the rights to a Gimmick! sequel.  It immediately got to work putting Istenes in front of Sunsoft to pitch the concept after an undisclosed, but no doubt significantly improved offer.</p><p>“I couldn't see how they reacted because it was a very small window in Microsoft Teams, and they were all wearing face masks,” recalls Istenes, describing his awkward videocall pitch to Sunsoft. “The translator also had an issue with her camera, so she had to turn it off. Then her default image was a cat, so it was like a cat was translating it. It was just weird. They could feel my passion for the game, though, and I think that's what truly nailed it in the end.”</p><p>Finally, a lifelong dream could be realised. Bitwave Games could now create a sequel to the long-forgotten masterpiece. There was just one problem… they now had to make a game that not only honoured the original, but one that surpassed it…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-2-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted it to stand on its own. We want it to be a fun platforming game that appeals to everyone,” explains Lead Programmer Olof Karlsson. “ We want it to be accessible, but also a true sequel. We don't want [fans of the original] to feel like we've massacred their boy. It should be like, ‘Wow, they really took this to a new direction but it's still Gimmick!.’”	</p><p>The passion for Gimmick! 2 at the Bitwave office during our visit was undeniable, but it was all built on the foundation of their love of the original. Istenes is proud of the space, particularly his treasured retro collection. And of course, the items that took pride of place were his valuable original editions of Gimmick!.</p><p>“I bought the PAL version first. It was $250,” recalls Istenes. “The guy who sold it had no idea what he had on his hands. He was cleaning his mother's basement, found a bunch of NES games he played when he was young, and decided to sell them on Tradera [Scandinavia’s eBay equivalent]. He was [very confused about] why this was so special.”</p><p>He wasn’t the only person struggling to understand the second-hand value of this long-forgotten cartridge. Gimmick! recently featured on the Swedish TV show, Bytt är bytt, A.K.A Trash or Treasure. It’s a show that tasks contestants to estimate the value of antique objects. Not only had the contestant, despite being a self-proclaimed NES fan, never heard of Gimmick!, but the host also openly declared it “The game that nobody wanted”. But Istenes wanted it. And he didn’t just want the Swedish edition, he wanted the definitive release.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bytt-quote-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“The Japanese version is the version you need because it has an extra sound chip,” reveals Istenes, pointing out that only the Famicom edition featured the revolutionary YM2149 sound processor, a piece of hardware that doubled the game’s audio channels. And when Istenes finally acquired his very own Japanese version, inside the collector's item’s case was more than just an enhanced Gimmick! cartridge. The seller had included a secret note…</p><p><em>"Hi, Niklas, my name is Takumi Hamada. Thank you bid. I'm very happy. I want to be friends with people around the world on eBay. Please contact bullshit. I always want to Japanese products. I help you anytime. Arigato."</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/japanese-notes-1724856838600.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><em>Hidden note from the Japanese eBay seller.</em></figcaption></figure></output><p>“He wanted to be friends with me on eBay,” says Istenes, smiling from ear to ear. “If you're out there, thank you very much for this amazing product, which does not contain any bullshit at all!”</p><p>Gimmick! was more than a game to Istenes. It was nostalgia in its purest form, reminding him of the time he spent enjoying the game with his childhood friend. Decades later, Gimmick! was still helping him forge friendships. “When I joined, it was just Niklas and Gustav and both of them were consultants,” explains Karlsson. “I was the only one working in-house. The reason I joined this company was because I wanted to work with Niklas.”</p><p>The Gimmick! 2 team was quickly being assembled, but by the time production of the long overdue sequel was in full swing Istenes obtained perhaps his greatest coup: “I reached out to a composer I used to work with, but he was too busy for the project,” says Istenes, “He told me to shoot for the stars though. Which composer would I want to work on a game like this? I thought it would be cool to work with someone like David Wise.”</p><p>It was clear that Istenes had no problem shooting for the stars. After already successfully getting the rights to his dream game, he boldly reached out to the iconic David Wise; the video game composer famous for soundtracks such as Donkey Kong Country and Battletoads. He was Istenes’ dream composer. And, perhaps to his surprise, Wise immediately said ‘yes’. </p><p>”I love [classic] Nintendo games and working on the platform,” says Wise. “It was an easy ‘Yep, I want to be involved.’"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The pair immediately got to work on finding Gimmick! 2’s unique musical tone, looking for the sweet spot between the original and the sequel's two countries of origin. “I've made sure I've used this wonderful instrument called the Nyckelharpa,” explains Wise, referring to a Swedish instrument whose name translates to ‘key harp’. “It’s like a violin, but it's got these little wooden switches on them. It's got its own ethereal sound and I was very keen to get that into the soundtrack.” </p><p>“I remember playing Donkey Kong Country and listening to the aquatic theme that he made and doing fan drawings when I was in school,” says Istenes. “It was just so amazing to be working with him.” </p><p>Not only had Istenes got the rights to make his dream sequel, but he had also struck a deal with his dream composer. Gimmick! 2’s production was progressing well. So well, in fact, that it was only a matter of time until disaster struck…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-3-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In June 2023, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program, making significant cuts to the entire workforce across all of its acquired studios. Unfortunately, staff at Bitwave Games were among the many casualties, losing half of their colleagues in one fell swoop. Gimmick! 2 was immediately put in jeopardy. </p><p>“When the news hit it was scary,” explains Istenes. “I didn't know exactly how it would affect the studio. It wasn't like I had a list of people that I knew would have to leave. But since it's a monetary situation, it needed to happen fast.”</p><p>“It was one of the darkest days in the history of our company,” says Senior Game Developer, Hampus Lidin. “I don't think we’d had such a huge setback before.” It was a setback that caused Lead Programmer Olof Karlsson to feel a little lost: “I was very confused about how to handle this. How do I feel? What am I supposed to feel?" </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was one of the darkest days in the history of our company.</p></div><p>“People who had to leave were a part of the company for five years, and there are some staff members that'd been a part of the project from the beginning,” shares Istenes. “You kind of just have to shut off your human part of the situation.” </p><p>Understandably, this was a tough pill to swallow for the affected staff. But Istenes was also deeply troubled by the situation, as he’d always thought of Embracer as the studio's saviour. In a single moment, everything was turned upside down. “I'm not blaming Embracer for what happened,” says Istenes. “It's external forces and how the industry is. My relationship with Embracer is still very good. They're just pivoting as well to just try to make the best out of a situation. Some hard calls needed to be made.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/embracer-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Embracer's June 2023 restructuring statement.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Six months had passed since we first visited the studio in February of 2023, and since then the Embracer cuts hadn’t been the only bad news for the production of Gimmick! 2. During that time, Lead Programmer Olaf Karlsson had stepped away from the project due to burnout, only to later return out of necessity after the layoffs.</p><p>“The fact that I only lasted six months before burning out was heartbreaking,” explains Karlsson. “I came back as a result of the layoffs. Niklas approached me and said, ‘I know that you burnt out on this previous project and that you didn't want to hear about it anymore, but could you consider coming back?’ And I was like, ’Yes, of course.’"</p><p>Gimmick! 2 had stalled, and there was a genuine fear that this labour of love might never make it to the finish line. But there was still an underlying determination from its leader to see it through, and that passion emanated through the entire studio. “I don't really want to work on something unless I feel like everyone around me really wants to do it,” says Karlsson. “To have the CEO want to do it this much [gives you] a level of engagement that you otherwise wouldn't really get.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It doesn't just feel like something wearing the old game’s skin. It feels like a true sequel to Gimmick!</p></div><p>Surprisingly, despite the hurdles, Gimmick! 2 got back on track fast, with Istenes – in a desperate attempt to save his dream – introducing a pivot into production.</p><p>“I want it to be the best game ever,” says Istenes. ”I want every idea that I have to be in the game, which makes it very, very hard to design a game like that. When the news broke, I knew we could still [finish] the game, but we needed to pivot back to the roots and focus more on gameplay. It was pretty clear from the beginning what we needed to cut in the game to still make it great and as long and enjoyable as we wanted it to be.”</p><p>The pivot back to a gameplay focus allowed the Bitwave team to refocus on their original vision, cut out the unnecessary bells and whistles, and double down on the core experience that made the original so beloved. “It feels more true. It feels more like a sequel.” explains Karlsson. “It doesn't just feel like something wearing the old game’s skin. It feels like a true sequel to Gimmick!. We can actually finish this still. This is doable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Gimmick! 2 is fast approaching. In fact, there’s a good chance it’s available for you to play right now. Despite the hardships, the whole project has been built with consistent passion. Whether it was a love of the original’s design, technology, hardware, or just plain nostalgia, Bitwave Games has been built on the foundation of Yumetaro, and that love bleeds through every frame of the sequel.</p><p>“The opportunity to work on Gimmick! 2 was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” explains Karlsson.”I think what will make it special is a combination of what we're aiming for; a very tight, mechanically interesting and fun platforming game with amazing visuals and a beautiful soundtrack composed by f**king David Wise of all people. How did we get David Wise? It's incredible.”</p><p>“I hope it captures the same spirit of the original,” says Pat the NES Punk. “ I hope it seems like a world of wonder with interesting enemies and characters you encounter along the way.” </p><p>“I hope people will learn more about the original one,” says Istenes. “I think this will be a much better game in more than one sense. But I hope people will play this, enjoy the game, and then go back and play the original game. And, hopefully, we’ll make a sequel to this one as well!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We didn't pick this to be the game that would make us the richest studio in Gothenburg.</p></div><p>For better or worse, Gimmick! 2 fulfils a lifelong ambition. Time will tell if the sequel will create its own lasting impact like its predecessor, or perhaps even exceed the original’s legacy. We don’t know if Bitwave Games will thrive or fall under the weight of an ever-evolving industry, and we don’t know if Gimmick! will ever truly receive all the praise it so clearly deserves. What we <em>do</em> know is that Yumetaro started a dream. A dream that built a studio, helped craft a vision decades in the making, and forged an assortment of beautiful friendships. </p><p>Not bad for a barely released, forgotten ‘90s game about an anthropomorphic, star-throwing green blob.</p><p>“This game has always been a project of the studio's heart,” says Istenes. “We didn't pick this to be the game that would make us the richest studio in Gothenburg. It’s to set a trend of how we make high-quality games, that's what we're aiming for here. As long as some people enjoy playing the game, and get a fun player experience from it, then I'm happy.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/gimmick-relfecting-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><em>Thank you to Pat the NES Punk, Illusory Wall, Pekachow, David Wise, Niklas Istenes, and everyone at Bitwave Games for their time. Special thank you to Jesse Gomez for production and Andréas Göransson for sharing the story.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Let’s be honest, Jackbox games have always been pretty naughty, if you’re playing with the right people, but Jackbox Games aren’t flirting with us anymore. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> is full frontal naughtiness, right down to the 69 pence or cents in the price tags.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a smaller collection than usual, with just three games included instead of five, but as everyone knows, it’s not about how how big the package is, but what you do with it. Jackbox Games has adapted two series staples with Dirty Drawful and Fakin’ It All Night Long, and come up with a brand new game, Let Me Finish, for the climax.</p>


<p>Dirty Drawful is, well, it’s Drawful but with dirtier suggestions than usual. Players are each given a prompt that they then need to try and draw on their phones, with each drawing then being shown to all players who try to come up with what the original prompt is. All those answers are then voted on by the group, who vote on which one they think was actually correct. Points happen, and everyone has a little giggle along the way from the blend of bad art and bad jokes.</p>
<p>But things are a bit naughtier now with opening prompts like “And God pisseth out the universe” and “Colon, I’m home!” which are… quite tricky concepts to get across with stick figures and wobbly lines. Sex, drugs and plenty more are going to appear in the full prompt list, and you’ll be very glad to hear that yes, there is an undo button this time.</p>


<p>Fakin’ It All Night Long is in the same vein, a filthier and slightly weirder version of the social deduction of Fakin’ It. Everyone gets a secret task, but one person gets a fake task and has to try to blend in with their response, with the category determining if you have to type out a response, raise a hand, a finger count – a ‘Finger Blast’ as it were – or respond with emoji in Emojinal Damage. Given how vague and multipurpose emoji can be, this one can lead to quite a lot of debate… Regardless of the category, you’re trying to read everyone else’s response, how quick they were to answer, how realistic they’re being, and between you deduce who it is that is the imposter for that round.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that you’re going to want to play this with a very particular group of friends, given how adult the questioning and prompts can be through Naughty Pack, but there’s an interesting pacing needed through the modes. The modes should start off relatively restrained before getting filthier through the game mode, the team told us at Gamescom, and they shouldn’t be too deeply personal. There’s no straight up question over a person’s ‘body count’, but there might be something about if you’ve had sex in a bathroom, for example, or more about personal preferences in the bedroom. Additionally, there is a streaming mode, content filters that will ensure that it’s safer for public consumption.</p>

<p>All in all, the prompts that we saw in our hands on time at Gamescom were on the more tame end of the scale, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK52_wJqL_0">seeing the team playing the games at PAX West</a> this weekend has shown off just how far the prompts can go – “From 1-5, with 5 being every time, how often do you come from head alone?” is pretty darned personal, if you ask me, while “Raise your hand if you would totes f*** a vampire” is in that playful nonsense category.</p>
<p>Onto the final game mode, Let Me Finish. This new game is a presentation style mode that gets filthy in a more abstract fashion. You’re given a picture, like a set of tools, and then get asked “Which of these tools likes a finger up the butt the best?” Or a stacked plate of nachos and the query “Where do these nachos snort cocaine into?” Complete nonsense, of course, like some of the best bizarre conversational tangents at the end of a long night out taken a few steps further. Two players are then thrown into a debate and can put their case forward using their phone to act as a laser pointer and temporary drawing tool, but other players are able to jump in and try to steal the question away as well.</p>

<p>Importantly for players around the world, Jackbox Naughty Pack is localised through French, Italian, German, Latin American Spanish and Castilian Spanish. That’s excellent news, but has been an interesting challenge for Jackbox Games and their established translation partners. There’s just so much slang that needs to be translated, with such a range of vulgarity that can go from playful to outright offensive. Striking the right balance there has led to a fair bit of back and forth, the team told us.</p>
<p>This is all a big experiment for Jackbox Games after a decade of releases in the main series, to see how much of an audience there is for this kind of thing. Bizarrely enough, as risqué as the topics might be, it feels like Jackbox is playing it safe with a smaller 3-game bundle, only one of which comes with a new title and theme. That’s potentially a bit disappointing, but if it’s successful, Jackbox could get a bit more adventurous with more naughty times in future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-may-have-only-sold-25-000-copies-analysts-say.969546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent breakdown from industry analysts, it was estimated that Concord – Sony’s floundering multiplayer shooter that was just released – may have only sold around 25,000 copies. It has been the talk of the town for several days, with Concord being released to a woeful reception and barely scraping up an all-time high player count of 697 users on PC.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, just 82 people were playing Concord on PC, and an analyst from Circana mentioned that when the game was released, ‘fewer than 0.2% of active PS5 players’ were on the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-failing-to-take-off">Failing To Take Off</h2>



<p>In the figures <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handed to IGN</a>, it was suggested that on Steam, around 10,000 copies of Concord had been sold, while on PlayStation, around 15,000 were estimated to have shipped.</p>



<p>Offering a key insight into the shoddy performance, Circana’s Mat Piscatella explained that Concord has ‘low awareness and purchase intent among video game players.’ Basically, nobody knows it exists and they don’t want to buy it if they do. With Concord being a new IP, it didn’t have an existing fan base to pick from, and starting from scratch needed an <strong>intense </strong>marketing campaign.</p>



<p>That just wasn’t there for Concord.</p>



<p>Even the first real trailers for the game only emerged at the end of May, giving players just a couple of months to understand the title before deciding if they wanted to invest in it. Unlike many other shooters making it to the market now, Concord has a premium price point, but free-to-play games are doing much better at present.</p>



<p>In a statement, Rhys Elliott of Midia Research explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A tight-knit group of players might be willing to take a chance on a new game for free, but paying $40 is a big ask in today’s macroeconomic climate. Launching Concord as a premium game limited its audience numbers and user acquisition. The more people who play a game, the more appealing it is. Network effects are crucial for building a healthy, engaged ecosystem. </p>



<p>Concord should have launched free-to-play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What are your thoughts on the topic? Do you think Concord might have succeeded if it was released as a free-to-play shooter supported by a live-service operating model?</p>

<p>Larian has revealed that the long-awaited seventh patch for Baldur’s Gate 3 will start rolling out next week. It’ll be deployed first on PC, with the team stressing that ‘it’ll take a little longer’ to apply the update on console. Patch 7 has been talked about for a few months, but now that it’s finally here, it’s about to bring countless changes and additions to the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-supporting-mods">Supporting Mods</h2>



<p>Larian confirmed several weeks ago that ‘Patch 7’ will contain official mod support, which is a boon for PC players worldwide. This includes support and various tools for modders to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the more dastardly players out there will be pleased to learn that Patch 7 introduces fresh cinematics and tweaks for the game’s ‘evil’ endings. </p>



<p>As you might expect, Patch 7 will also deliver a host of quality-of-life changes and some optimisations on the companion front. It’s believed that this could be one of the final few major updates for Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as Larian is now done with the series. It was confirmed a while ago that the studio won’t release any expansions or DLC for the award-winning game.</p>



<p>While Larian’s Swen Vincke confirmed Patch 7 will be released ‘next week’, he neglected to provide a more specific date, but we should have that information very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24232337/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-nintendo-switch-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sure, it’s not straight-up horror as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195658/close-enough-welcome-back-slenderman">the early teasers suggested</a>, but even still, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24195883/emio-nintendo-smiling-man-switch-famicom-detective-club-date"><em>Emio — The Smiling Man</em></a> is among the darkest games Nintendo has ever made. It’s a murder mystery that doesn’t skimp on the murder and throws in an unsettling urban legend for good measure. More than that, though, it’s just a really great mystery on a platform that has steadily become an ideal home for them.</p><p><em>Emio</em> is actually the continuation of a decades-old franchise from Nintendo called <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>. Created by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"><em>Metroid</em> designer Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, the games originally never launched outside of Japan, until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435952/famicom-detective-club-review-nintendo-switch">a pair of surprise remakes hit the Switch in 2021</a>. <em>Emio</em> is the first entirely new entry in the franchise since the late ’80s — but even still, not a lot has changed.</p><p>As with its predecessors, <em>Emio</em> plays out like a visual novel, where your actions are determined by a series of verbs on a menu. This is how you “look” at a crime scene or “ask” a witness questions or “review” your notes. Sometimes, the actions are contextual — you can’t talk to someone if there’s no one there — but there are almost always a few things you can do at any given moment. If not, you can always “think.”</p><p>It’s not the most elegant way to engage with the world, but it is functional. It also necessitates a lot of reading and repetition. You often have to press witnesses by asking the same questions over and over, and the only way to learn what happened is to listen to people. That combination is something of an acquired taste, and also one that only really works with the right narrative — which is where <em>Emio</em> shines.</p><p>The game tells the story of a series of murders involving a killer who both wears a paper bag with a creepy smiley face and also puts one on his victims. At the outset of the game, a recent killing appears to connect to a series of murders 18 years prior and also possibly ties into an urban legend about a person named Emio who kills with nearly identical methods. You play as a young assistant of a private investigator, working alongside the police to put the various pieces together.</p><p>Because there are so many moving parts and — at first — only loose theories holding them together, I had a lot of fun doing all of the asking, looking, and reviewing. It’s very satisfying when things click into place. There are plentiful threads to pull on, which shift the story into even darker and more disturbing directions as the scope becomes clear. Even without the horror element, there’s plenty to be creeped out about in <em>Emio</em>.</p><p>The game also joins a sizable lineup of similar mysteries on the Switch, which feel right at home due to its portable nature, like the video game equivalent of a good book. Outside of <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597736/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-review-switch-ps4-steam"><em>Ace Attorney</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"><em>Murder by Numbers</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689348/coffee-talk-episode-2-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, to name a few. <em>Emio</em>’s gameplay might feel a touch dated in comparison, but its core mystery carries it through.</p><p><small>Emio — The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Discord wants to share your recent playtime with your friends.</p>
<p>Discord's activity tracker now displays not only the games you've been playing over the last 30 days, but also long you've been playing them, too.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you've returned to a game after a hiatus, your tracker will indicate to your pals that you've made a comeback.</p>

<p>Just click on your friend's profile in your Friends List, and the pop-up will reveal how long they've been playing - or possibly idling in, going on the example from my own list below - the last game they opened.</p>

<p>For those less keen to share - or perhaps have their boss on their Discord friends list - you can turn the activity log off by going to Activity Settings &gt; Activity Privacy &gt; Activity Status, and turn off "share your detected activities with others" and "share your activity status by default when joining large servers".</p>
<p>Discord has also partnered with Amazon Music Unlimited to launch a new Amazon Music Listening Party activity, with a free three-month trial (availability will vary, though, I'm afraid). You can also proudly link your RPG Roll20 accounts, too.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-latest-discord-feature-update-brings-direct-friend-calling-and-more">Microsoft confirmed it was expanding Discord support on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One</a> with a number of new features, including a consolidated Xbox and Discord friends list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the update is available, it'll be possible to initiate a Discord call, jump straight into a voice channel, or watch a friend streaming directly from the Xbox Friends list.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
