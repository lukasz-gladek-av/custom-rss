            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/all-digital-xbox-series-x-will-debut-this-holiday/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled three new variants of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles, with the most intriguing of the three being the all-digital Xbox Series X. All will be available later in 2024 in time for the holidays.</p>
<p><iframe title="Three New Xbox Series X|S Consoles - World Premiere Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzDPNi77F24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The all-digital Xbox Series X will come in the Robot White of the Series S, feature a 1TB SSD, and most importantly ditch the disc drive. This will be priced at $449.99/€499.99 ERP​ – a $50 saving on the standard Xbox Series X, but only matching the original launch price of the console (the price was hiked last summer).</p>
<p>If you still like optical drives, then there’s also a special edition Xbox Series X with a sparkly Galaxy Black design and featuring a 2TB internal SSD. This will set you back $599.99/€649.99​ ERP, so a $100 jump over the main console.</p>
<p>And if you liked <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/11/xbox-series-s-carbon-black-edition-gets-a-1tb-internal-ssd-and-350-price/">the 1TB Xbox Series S</a>, but didn’t want it in black, then that will be available in the base Series S white colour scheme. It’s got the same $350 price point.</p>

<p>It would certainly seem that Microsoft has dropped plans for an “adorably all-digital” cylindrical Series X design, which is a a little shame. It would have been a bit more interesting than these variants, with Microsoft seemingly just treading water when all the rumours and insider reports point to Sony having a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/report-ps5-pro-specs-leak-reveals-big-gpu-bump-faster-ram-cpu-and-more/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> waiting in the wings.</p>

            <p>Up and atom! There is a British Fallout-like game on the horizon from Sniper Elite studio, Rebellion.</p>
<p>It's called Atomfall, and it was revealed at this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox showcase</a>. The team describes Atomfall as a single-player survival action game which will see players exploring a post-nuclear environment, and then scavenging, crafting, bartering and - of course - fighting to survive.</p>
<p>While Atomfall's story is fictional, it has been inspired by a real-world nuclear disaster that occurred in northern England in 1957. Players will experience Britain five years after this event, and find that "everything has changed" after that fateful day. You can check out the trailer - complete with British hymns, bunting and phone boxes - below.</p>

<p>"Atomfall blends post-war Britain with Cold War paranoia, folk horror, and elements of classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who and The Prisoner, to create an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience," reads the official blurb. "Set in the rolling British countryside with idyllic pubs, quaint villages, and red phone boxes it soon becomes clear that things are far from normal."</p>
<p><a href="https://support.rebellion.com/hc/en-gb/categories/18824031303325-Atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set to release across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and PC at some point in 2025. It will also be available day one on Game Pass. We can expect to hear more "soon", so stay tuned. </p>

            <p>Microsoft and Blizzard have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>'s forthcoming content-o-season Vessel Of Hatred. It's out 8th October 2024, and sees you hooting and hollering down the road to the new region of Nahantu in search of Neyrelle, a character "who is both suffering the fate of her choice to imprison the Prime Evil Mephisto, and seeking a means to destroy him". In the process, you may choose to become "the apex predator of the jungle as the all-new Spiritborn class". You can also recruit mercenaries to help you, fight alongside other players in a new PvE co-op activity, "and more".</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft published a cinematic trailer for Vessel Of Hatred during their latest Xbox Game Showcase stream. The trailer is full of horrible squelching noises and screaming. I had it playing in another tab while I was writing up a trailer for the relatively wholesome and unhellish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playgrounds-fable-slated-for-2025-release-heres-a-trailer-hinting-at-what-its-like-to-play">Fable</a>, and the clashing combination of stimuli has done a number on my brain. I refuse to actually watch the trailer. You can though. Here's the embed. I'm sure it's not as bad as it sounds. They have kids watching these showcases, don't they? I'm sure all the squelching and screaming is just... jungle calls, or something. Possibly a species of forest mushroom that resonates in a bizarre way under certain conditions.</p>

<p>You can learn more of Hatred's Vessel on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043530/Diablo_IV_Vessel_of_Hatred/">the Steam page</a>. Hang on, they've got pictures of widdle baby cats on there! Not remotely squelchy or screamy or hateful or even apex-predatory! I can get behind that. These are seemingly the new pets that Blizzard have just now added to the game - you'll find them when you next log in. </p>
<p>Long-in-the-tooth Diablo players like Graham will, of course, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-first-expansion-revives-diablo-2s-mephisto-the-lord-of-hatred">recognise Vessel Of Hatred</a> as a throwback to the story of Diablo 2.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-everything-we-know">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, the long-awaited sequel to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> that perhaps emanates the most shame in my backlog, has a new combat-focused trailer showing off the many dangers of the enigmatic Zone. You’ll also be pleased to know that the release date remains the same as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-pushed-back-again-to-september-2024-to-fix-technical-imperfections">previous announcement</a>: September 5th 2024, where it will be coming to Game Pass day one. Here’s the tray-tray:</p>

<p>In stark contrast to the previous trailer, this one is all action. Standard human enemies soon give way to mutated beasties, and some sort of electrical interference that I don’t know anything about crackles and bursts throughout. I’m intrigued though. Perhaps this is the work of the famous ‘Cherno Bill’ of which the game’s title speaks?</p>
<p>Giving the situation the Ukrainian dev team of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 have found themselves in since work on the game started, it’s a downright herculean feat that the game is releasing at all, let alone looking so good. Following Russia’s invasion, GSC Game World <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gsc-game-world-are-back-working-on-stalker-2-again">relocated to Prague</a> in early 2022. Since then, they’ve suffered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-hacked-and-threatened-asks-fans-to-ignore-leaks">hacks, threats</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-test-footage-has-leaked-online-after-a-year-and-a-half-of-hacker-attacks">leaked footage</a>, none of which have deterred them from bringing this sequel to one of the more beloved PC shooters to life.</p>

Naked Snake is lookin’ pretty stylish in the upcoming remake of <em>MGS3</em>, branded <em>MGS Delta Snake Eater</em>. And while I’m certainly not the biggest fan of <em>MGS3</em>, ya’ll, this actually looks really tight. Consider me intrugied, Konami!<br></p><hr><h2 id="h340726"><a id=""></a><em>Sea of Thieves </em>Season 13<br></h2><p>Piracy’s alive and well, baby!

It arrives on September 4, 2024.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h340729"><a id=""></a><em>Perfect Dark</em><br></h2><p>Woo! <em>Perfect Dark </em>is coming back and it looks fucking sick.

Today’s trailer showed off what looks like it has the potential to be a pitch-perfect return to Albion, narrated by a retired hero who almost sounds like he couldn’t be bothered.

<p>Xbox is hitting hard with its showcase at Summer Game Fest. We saw the first official reveal of the upcoming Black Ops 6 and then immediately jumped straight into a high-octane trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages. But do we know the Doom: The Dark Ages release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-doom-the-dark-ages-coming-out">When is Doom: The Dark Ages Coming Out?</h2>



<p>I have to say, as someone who is still relatively new to the Doom franchise overall, this trailer absolutely caught my attention. Unfortunately, the only thing we know about the Doom: The Dark Ages release date is that the game is coming <strong>sometime in 2025</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Based on the overall state of the gameplay we saw during the Xbox Games Showcase, I don’t think we’ll have to wait too long into 2025 for this one to hit digital shelves. It’s looking absolutely phenomenal, frantic, and chaotic in all the right ways!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-doom-the-dark-ages-multiplayer">Is Doom: The Dark Ages Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Currently, the only thing we know for sure is that Doom: The Dark Ages focuses on its single-player campaign. We’re unclear whether a multiplayer component will be part of the core experience.</p>



<p>According to the game’s Steam store page:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is the single-player, action FPS prequel to the critically acclaimed DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior fighting endlessly against Hell. Experience the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It appears developer id Software is busy focusing on a cinematic story-based campaign above all else, but that’s not a bad thing this time around!</p>

<p>If you’re anything like us, then you want more information on Black Ops 6. More specifically, you want to know about the first-person shooter’s multiplayer in greater depth. Well, you won’t have to wait long. Here is what we know about when Call of Duty Next takes place this summer!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-call-of-duty-next-take-place">When Does Call of Duty Next Take Place?</h2>



<p>As part of the deep dive into this year’s upcoming Call of Duty, we know Call of Duty Next occurs on <strong>August 28</strong>! That’s not too long to wait for additional information on what’s already promising to be this year’s greatest first-person shooter launch. I mean, seriously, did you see the gameplay reveal trailer? How about the deep dive following the Xbox Games Showcase? I’m beyond excited for this one!</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-what-we-ll-see-at-call-of-duty-next">What We’ll See at Call of Duty Next</h2>



<p>While can’t provide you with a definitive answer as to what precisely we’ll see at Call of Duty Next, we do know, thanks to the lengthy deep dive into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, it will primarily focus on multiplayer. That’s likely to include both competitive multiplayer game modes and maps, along with the iconic zombies game mode and its multiple maps and features.</p>



<p>Personally, I’d love to see more emphasis on the weapons and customization options available, as that’s a big part of why I enjoy this series—playing around with unique builds and playstyles in a fast-paced setting.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see more of during the upcoming showcase in August? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/perfect-dark-gameplay-reveal-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>What Kind of Game Is This?</strong></p><p><em>Perfect Dark</em> is a first-person secret agent thriller in a near-future world. With the blessing of the original <em>Perfect Dark</em> studio, <a title="Companies > Rare [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/xbox-game-studios/rare">Rare</a> (not to mention some of the leads from the original titles), Team <em>Perfect Dark</em> has pulled inspiration from elements of the first two games, but crafted an entirely new story and universe around them for this reboot.</p><p>For previous fans and new players alike, the new game offers a fresh take on the secret agent experience, and is a great opportunity to jump into the world and character. Though fans will have moments that resonate with the history and memories of the original games, no prior knowledge is needed in this new experience.</p><p>At the widest level, <em>Perfect Dark</em> will be a single-player experience, with a set of missions – but with choices offered in how you complete those missions. Looking at the trailer, it’s clear that traversal and gadgets are a huge part of this – we see new parkour abilities used throughout, both for movement and combat. The developers tell me that the focus was on creating an intuitive movement system, which will let players find interesting ways to tackle their objectives. Add to that a combat system that allows for both melee and gunplay, <a title="Genres > Stealth [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> mechanics, and liberal use of gadgets, and <em>Perfect Dark</em> is a game that will present players with an objective, but let them figure out how they want to achieve it.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Team <em>Perfect Dark</em> doesn’t want this to feel like any one genre – it takes in elements of first-person shooters, immersive sims, and stealth-<a title="Genres > Action [1,908 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, but blends them into a seamless whole. The goal is to offer a true secret agent fantasy – and letting players use their various tools and abilities in the way they want is key to this.</p><p><strong>Who is Joanna Dark?</strong></p><p>In this reboot, Joanna (voiced by Alix Regan with Elissa Bibaud lending visual likeness) is an agent for dataDyne, with a deep personal connection to what’s happening to her world. In this case, the title <em>Perfect Dark</em> is more aspirational—this Joanna won’t be perfect, but she’s striving to be. She’ll make mistakes in this journey, and learn from those experiences. Learning who this Joanna is proves to be just as compelling as the story itself.</p><p><strong>Where Is the Game Set?</strong></p><p><em>Perfect Dark</em>‘s near-future world has been impacted by what’s known as “The Cascade,” in which the planet has suffered from a series of environmental disasters, rendering entire regions inhospitable to human life. In the wake of the disaster, a hypercorporation known as Core Mantis steps in to create a solution known as The GEN Network, and deploys it in Cairo – restoring ecological balance and creating a freshly walled city, insulated from the hostile environment outside to become a center for technological innovation.</p><p>In its wake, other hypercorporations step in to continue that regeneration – but, as you might expect, not all is as it seems, and their motives may be less altruistic than they appear. It is key that the setting communicates a hopeful future, seeing a world with both destruction and restoration, the bleakness of the past countered with a sense of promise.</p><p>It’s into Cairo that Joanna enters. The setting was chosen to offer a counterpoint to other secret agent stories, and media at large – ancient Egypt and modern Egypt have been seen by many, but a near-future take on the country is truly something new. Cairo itself allows for a balance of deeply old and startlingly new that suits the speculative fiction at the heart of <em>Perfect Dark</em>.</p><p><strong>What’s Joanna’s Mission in the Trailer?</strong></p><p>Joanna is being sent into Cairo to find and apprehend Daniel Carrington, and we see her enter a district called Garden City (and an area of Cairo in real life, too). In <em>Perfect Dark</em>, this is a more affluent and cosmopolitan area of the city, and Core Mantis has selected it to be revitalized by its new eco-technological processes.</p><p>We see Joanna find a hideout used by Carrington, who infiltrates Joanna’s AR system and begins to expose more information, and even more questions around the bigger mysteries in Cairo. Joanna will need to learn who can be trusted, and who might be working against her own goals, and Carrington’s role will be a major part of that.</p><p><strong>What Can We Use Gadgets For?</strong></p><p>Gadgets are a pillar of the secret agent genre. In the trailer, we get a tease of Joanna using a gadget to analyse NPC voices and create vocal “deepfakes” to trick security systems or impersonate other characters, as well as create distractions.</p><p>Gadgets can be used for misdirection and manipulation, but we also see that Joanna can use a tool to scan an NPC and learn details about them – it wouldn’t be a secret agent story without some fieldwork, and the developers tell me that parsing the world, around you will be a key part of understanding how to tackle your objectives.</p><p><strong>How Does Combat Work?</strong></p><p>With this first look at combat, it’s clear this is another aspect of player choice. In the trailer we see lethal and non-lethal weaponry, close-quarters combat, abilities that allow you to take down multiple enemies at once, and more.

One map was shown during the trailer, taking place on an island with a military base on it. It's not clear which of the two maps this is, but it was confirmed that both maps would be brand new. Black Ops Cold War's round-based Zombies maps were primarily built around sections of the campaign, but these maps appear to be built for Zombies. These maps were teased to include special weapons and brand-new easter eggs for die-hard fans to complete.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtI25vEDx38" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It was also confirmed that the storyline started in Black Ops Cold War, called the Dark Aether, would continue in this game. Treyarch did not confirm if the mode would feature a distinct set of four characters or if players would be allowed to use any operator and skin they wanted, similar to Black Ops Cold War. Some of the new features present in Black Ops 6, like the Omnidirectional movement which allows player to sprint and dive in any direction, will also be present in Zombies.</p><p>While not discussed in the showcase itself, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preorder-guide/1100-6524005/" data-ref-id="1100-6524005">Black Ops 6 preorder</a> bonuses include a pack of Gobble Gums, confirming the return of the special item. Gobble Gums were special, sometimes limited use, items that provided special bonuses during a Zombies match if used. These items were somewhat controversial at the time, since they were tied to microtransactions. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a> arrives on October 25 and will be on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>

        <p>Black Ops 6 dated for October 25, Fable and South of Midnight expected in 2025, Dragon Age due this year</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>During a strong Xbox Showcase today, Microsoft unveiled a new Doom and a new Gears of War, showed a debut trailer for Perfect Dark, announced the release date for this year's Call of Duty, and more.</p>
<p>Bethesda unveiled Doom: The Dark Ages during the show, coming in 2025, while Xbox Game Studios revealed that a new Gears of War is in development, a prequel called E-Day. Both will be releasing day-and-date on Game Pass.</p>
<p>After years in development limbo, we also finally had a first look at the Perfect Dark reboot from The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics, which will also come day one on Game Pass. The title wasn't dated though.</p>
<p>The release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was announced during the stream. The latest entry in the shooter franchise is set to release on October 25, 2024, though the launch window leaked via Microsoft’s own listing on the Xbox Store a few hours before the stream.</p>
<p>Compulsion Games unveiled gameplay for South of Midnight for the first time, with the title from the We Happy Few studio expected in 2025 and, you guessed it, day-and-date on Game Pass.</p>
<p>The show featured the highly awaited debut trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard (previously known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf), with the EA and BioWare title expected to release in fall 2024.</p>
<p>Playground's Fable was also given a release window of 2025 via a new trailer, while Microsoft also showed new footage of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (MachineGames) and Avowed (Obsidian) ahead of their release this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere for Xbox studios, Bethesda unveiled a Starfield expansion expected for later this year called Shattered Space, and a Fallout 76 expansion (Skyline Valley) launching on June 12.</p>
<p>Blizzard announced a new World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within, for August 26, and Diablo 4 DLC, Vessel of Hatred, for October 8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, season 13 of Sea of Thieves was dated for July 25,  Age of Mythology: Retold (a remaster of the classic strategy game) will release on September 4, and State of Decay developer Undead Labs unveiled a third entry in the hit franchise.</p>
<p>Outside of Xbox's own studios, Sandfall Interactive announced its debut title, published by Kepler Interactive, called Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and coming in 2025. Kepler will also publish A44 Games' Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, dated for July 17, which received a new trailer in the Xbox showcase. Both will be releasing day-and-date on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Square Enix and Deck 9 unveiled a new Life is Strange murder mystery called Double Exposure, with returning protagonist Max Caulfield, due on October 29.</p>
<p>Finally, Rebellion revealed its new game, Atomfall, due next year, and the long awaited Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, will launch on September 5. Again, both will be available on Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-only-xbox-series-x-is-one-of-three-new-models-launching-this-holiday">announced three new Xbox Series models</a>, including a digital-only Xbox Series X.</p>

The trailer, which features an impressive art style and character animation that drops frames&nbsp;à la <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>, will feature music from bands like Devo, Roxy Music, Lush, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/new-batman-arkham-shadow-vr-pre-rendered-trailer-teases-the-story">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, among others.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCTH8R6RD74?start=2" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive and is coming some time in 2025.</p>

<p>With that said, much of the rest of the game does seem to match an expectation of crafting, baking, resource gathering, and many of the other features you’d expect out of a survival game, albeit with an adorable aesthetic of anthropomorphic mice as the visual style.</p>

<p>Publisher Noodlecake intends to release the game on Xbox consoles, and PC in early 2025.</p>

<p>Give a look to the trailer to get a better understanding of how the game plays.</p>

After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We visited BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more. We also spoke to many of the game's leads about the name change, the series' shift to real-time action combat, the various companions (and the relationships you can forge with them), and The Veilguard's hub location. You can learn about the titular Veilguard, Solas' role in the game, and so much more in our 12-page cover story for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>But there are plenty of other excellent reads within this issue of&nbsp;<em>Game Informer</em>! Some of us flew to Los Angeles, California, to attend Summer Game Fest and the not-E3 weekend's various other events to check out new games, interview developers, and more. Our previews section is jam-packed with new details about upcoming releases we can't wait for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brian Shea flew to Warsaw, Poland, to check out two upcoming releases – Frostpunk 2 and The Alters – and he came away excited about both. Jon Woodey went hands-on with Final Fantasy XIV's upcoming Dawntrail expansion (and spoke to director Naoki Yoshida, too), and as someone with 8,000 hours in the game, his words are the ones you'll want to read.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the freelance front, Charlie Wacholz writes about how last year's Dave The Diver is one of the best game representations of the rewards and struggles of working in the food and beverage industry, and Grant Stoner spoke with Sony and Microsoft about the development of process and history of the companies' Adaptive and Access controllers. And for a lil' terror this summer, Ashley Bardhan spoke to several horror game developers about why the alluring town known as Silent Hill is a crucial location to Konami's horror masterpiece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As always, you'll find an editor's note from editor-in-chief Matt Miller, reviews from various freelancers and staff editors, a Top 5 list (hint hint: dragons), and more.&nbsp;</p>

More specifically, Skyline Valley expands the game's map southward to the all-new Shenandoah region on June 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There, players will investigate the cause of an electrical storm circling overhead and unveil the mystery around Vault 63. In this mysterious vault, players will meet its dwellers and discover a new Ghoul type called The Lost, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Fallout 76: Skyline Valley trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGDLe7HShLk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer above, the Shenandoah region is not looking so great in post-apocalyptic America. Plus, the trailer also reveals that Fallout 76 players can play as Ghouls starting sometime next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During the <em>CoD </em>Direct, Treyarch gave players a good idea of what they can expect from multiplayer in <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em>. </p> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 </em>is set to launch with 12 new 6v6 maps and four Strike maps that support 2v2 and 6v6 matches. None of these maps are remastered, meaning they will be new environments that vary in sizes and support traditional three-lane gameplay. There will be 12 new weapons and several other familiar guns inspired by other titles to choose from. However, Carry Forward will only be available in <em>Warzone</em>, meaning players won’t be able to use weapons from <em>MW2</em> and <em>MW3</em> in <em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer. </p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">In addition, the classic prestige system returns in <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Military ranks go from 1 to 55. At level 55, prestige begins, and at launch, there will be 10 prestiges available to progress through. After reaching 10th prestige, there are 1000 additional levels. There are no seasonal level caps, meaning players can start their journey to prestige 10 on day one. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="631" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">Next,<em> Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer loadouts allow players to equip a primary, secondary, and dedicated melee weapon, lethal and tactical grenades, field upgrades, three perks, a perk specialty, and wildcards. Base weapons can equip five attachments, but that goes up to eight with a wildcard. There are three categories of perks: Enforcer, Recon, and Strategist. Each option supports a different playstyle and perks are divided in to Perk one, two, and three. If you equip the same category of perk across all three, you get a specality. For example, if you equip all three Enforcer, your speed and health with refresh after each kill. </p>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">Treyarch will provide more information about multiplayer on <em>CoD</em> Next August 28 as content creators will be flown out to give players a first look at what full 6v6 match looks like. </p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Microsoft digital-only push continues. During today’s Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft unveiled a new line-up of Xbox Series X|S consoles, two of which are all-digital, and one special edition console with a disc drive. The three new consoles are set to release this holiday 2024 season.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Three New Xbox Series X|S Consoles - World Premiere Announce Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzDPNi77F24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">Oddly enough, the two all-digital consoles have a smaller SSD than the one that comes with a disc drive.

		<p>Microsoft closed out the Xbox Games Showcase 2024 with the announcement of Gears of War E-Day, with a traditional blend of violence and emotive music – specifically a new instrumental version of Mad World to echo the series’ debut. Check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars. This also means that the game will be almost entirely fought against the Locust than the robots and other foes found in the more recent sequels.</p>
<p>The Coalition has always sought to pioneer technology with Unreal Engine and Xbox, and E-Day is no different. The game is built on Unreal Engine 5, looking to make the most of all its key tech, and showcasing it in this trailer. Just as the original Gears of War trailer was rendered in-engine, so has the E-Day announcement.</p>
<p>The Coalition touts over 100 times as much environmental and character detail than in Gears 5, hardware ray-tracing for lighting, reflections and shadows, overhauled destruction, gore and animation, and plenty more.</p>

<p>While many had expected Gears 6 to be announced this year, E-Day as a sequel is not being seen as a spin-off to the main series, but rather the next mainline entry.</p>
<p>There’s currently no word on platforms or release window, so it will be very interesting to see how that pans out, given recent rumours…</p>

		<p>The Xbox Showcase continues with the reveal of Atomfall from Rebellion. It is set in the British countryside and we can tell that’s where we are due to the use of red telephone boxes and double decker buses, the universal sign of “This is British”,</p>
<p>There seems to have been some sort of nuclear issue, the game audio references Windscale, the old name for Sellafield, &nbsp;large multi-function<em>&nbsp;nuclear </em>site on the coast of Cumbria, England. There are robots,&nbsp; glowing ghouls and destroyed landscapes to wander around, it all looks rather Fallout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall Reveal Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HG3si5zKv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“A single player, survival-action game, Atomfall blends post-war Britain with Cold War paranoia, folk horror, and elements of classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who and The Prisoner, to create an immersive and thrilling gameplay experience. Set in the rolling British countryside with idyllic pubs, quaint villages, and red phone boxes it soon becomes clear that things are far from normal. Created by Rebellion, the makers of the much-loved Sniper Elite and Zombie Army franchises,”</em></p>
<p><em>“Atomfall is inspired by a real-world nuclear disaster that occurred in northern England in 1957. The game follows a fictional storyline where you find yourself in the quarantine zone five years after the event. Everything has changed in that time, and you find yourself in a very different Britain, on the wrong side of the quarantine wall. The area is run by the military and beset with factions, in-fighting, and a growing sense of fear. It’s up you to unravel the mystery of what happened. Explore the countryside, villages, and settlements and meet odd people, wicked cults, rogue government agencies and others along the way. Explore this open world adventure and seek out the truth at your own pace.”</em></p>

            <p>
Gears of War 6's development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gears-of-war-game-in-the-works-according-to-new-job-listings">hasn't been much of a secret</a>, but it's now finally official - with tonight's Xbox Games Showcase revealing it to be a prequel titled Gears of War: E-Day.
</p>
<p>
Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, E-Day tells the story of the first Locust emergence on Sera, and the world's response to that threat.
</p>
<p>
It promises a return of the series' trademark third-person, cover-based shooting action, all within an "explosive" campaign combining "satisfying gameplay and emotive, character-led storytelling".

<p>
It's also described as a "story of many origins", and players can expect to see some classic Gears staples - including the Chainsaw Lancer - in early forms previously unseen. That includes some familiar faces, with the trailer feature very youthful appearances from Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago.
</p>
<p>
"We're telling the origin story of Marcus and Dom and their bond," developer The Coalition <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/">explains on Xbox Wire</a>. "This is the bond that defines the franchise. They're not the characters we know from Gears 1 to 3. They don't have 10 years of fighting the Locust between them. When the game opens, there's supposed to be peace on Sera,'and they’re trying to figure out life without this person [Dom’s older brother, Carlos] they both loved."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft didn't provide any hint of a release window during Gears of War: E-Day's reveal, but with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">movie and animated series</a> also in the works, there's a lot for Gears of War fans to look forward to.

            <p>I feel like we've already got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-going-on-in-avowed-we-quiz-obsidian-after-the-xbox-developer-direct">pretty good idea</a> of what Obsidian's upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is all about by now. But just in case you needed a reminder, or wanted a closer look at its colourful fantasy landscape, tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox Games Showcase</a> brought us a new 'story trailer' for it. Have a watch below.</p>

<p>As per previous Avowed trailers, you play as an envoy of Aedyr sent to investigate a mysterious plague known as 'The Dream Scourge' that's spreading through the wild frontier of The Living Lands - an all-new region of the Pillars of Eternity world we haven't seen before. </p>
<p>But as the masked, flame-eyed knight in the trailer suggests, there's more going on with the Dream Scourge than meets the eye. They call it a "symptom of a deeper, more dangerous rot" in the land, and ask you to tame the chaos so that they might rise up and shape The Living Lands' future. </p>
<p>But then a third voice chimes in saying both your Aedyr homeland and the knight are deceiving you, and that in fact there's another, unseen dimension at play here, too. Embracing <em>this</em> side of the battle and becoming The Living Lands' protector is actually where your loyalties should lie, they say, but honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if all three of them were duping you in some respect. None of them seem particularly savoury or trustworthy if you ask me, but as the trailer implies, you will eventually have to pick a side and 'forge your destiny'.   </p>
<p>Alas, if you were hoping for a concrete date on which to do so, you'll be disappointed. Avowed is still just dated for 2024 at the moment, though it will be coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on day one when it does.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft has revealed three new Xbox console variants with increased storage capacity, available at the end of the year in select markets.
</p>
<p>
Two are all-digital: a 1TB Xbox Series X in "Robot White" and a 1TB Xbox Series S in the same colour. The third is a "special edition" 2TB Xbox Series X in "Galaxy Black" that features a disc drive.
</p>
<p>
It's clear with these new consoles, Microsoft is edging ever closer to an all-digital future. The "special edition" physical console will be available in "limited quantities", but critically there is at least still an option for physical media.

<p>
The pricing is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB in Robot White - $349.99/€349.99 ERP</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 1TB Digital Edition - $449.99/€499.99 ERP</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - $599.99/€649.99 ERP</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is a mid-generation refresh, then, and not pro versions of the console. Microsoft has not announced pro consoles, nor are they expected.
</p>
<p>
That also means Microsoft is continuing with the underpowered Series S for now, which has hampered the release of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth Wukong</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're hard at work on the next generation," said president of Xbox Sarah Bond during the showcase.
</p>
<p>The consoles will be available to pre-order in the coming months. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">technical specification of the PlayStation 5 Pro has already leaked</a>, though it's yet to be announced by Sony.

            <p>At this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-xbox-games-showcase-right-here-with-us">Xbox showcase</a>, Bethesda and developer Machine Games gave us all another little peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>The team shared a look at what it calls a "pivotal cinematic", in which Indy and his sidekick (for this game at least) Gina "make a startling discovery in the Himalayas". There is a kerfuffle over a stone, and of course, some explosions and bad guys getting thrown off cliffs.</p>
<p>You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>"Grab your hat and whip and prepare to embark on an epic, globetrotting adventure in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle," reads the official blurb. "Become the legendary archaeologist and face off against sinister forces as you fight to uncover the truth behind one of history's greatest mysteries."</p>
<p>Machine Games and Bethesda did not share a release date for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The current line is still that the game is coming at some point this year, and when it does arrive, it will be available across Xbox Series X/S and PC. This includes day one with Game Pass.</p>
<p>Elsewhere this evening, we got a look at a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">new teen drama game known as Mixtape</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developers-south-of-midnight-launches-2025">Compulsion Games' South of Midnight</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, to name but a few.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-6-announcement-coming-in-june-showcase-says-report">rumours</a> of a new Gears of War appearing at today’s Xbox Games Showcase were accurate - well, mostly. The next Gears of War won’t be a sequel like Gears of War 6, but instead looks to be a prequel to the entire series that returns to the very beginning of the bloody battle between humanity and the alien Locust.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The next Gears of War is called Gears of War: E-Day, referring to the universe’s Emergence Day event - when the Locust Horde invaded the planet of Sera (Gears of War’s Earth equivalent) from their underground civilisation of the Hollow, killing billions of humans and sparking the Locust War that serves as the backdrop to the games’ storyline. The first Gears of War takes place 14 years after E-Day, meaning that this next Gears will delve into how things ended up as seen in the series’ 2006 debut.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day won’t only provide a backstory for the wider Gears-iverse, as developed nowadays by The Coalition, but some origins for muscled shooterman heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago too.</p>

<p>E-Day’s first reveal trailer, as shown during the Xbox showcase, very much focused on that story side of things, with not a clip of gameplay in sight - though we do know it’ll be in Unreal Engine 5. Marcus wrestles around a house with a Locust Drone - redesigned for the prequel as a more deadly enemy than the hordes you mow down in latter-day Gears games - clocking it with a TV showing an emergency signal before finally blowing its brains out with an earlier model of the MK1 Lancer, equipped with a bayonet rather than a chainsaw. Then the house disintegrates into a glowing E-Hole, with Marcus being rescued by none other than a younger Dom.</p>
<p>The trailer simply ends with the two looking out over a city bathed in flames and destruction as spider-like Locust robots clamber over destroyed buildings on Sera.</p>
<p>In a particularly fun nod to E-Day’s place at the start of the series’ chronology, the trailer riffs on Gary Jules’ piano cover of Tears for Fears’ Mad World used in the earliest Gears of War advertisements almost two decades ago (ouch).</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day wasn’t given a release date during its reveal, but we do know it’ll land on Game Pass on day one.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft have released a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-happy-few-devs-reveal-south-of-midnight-a-new-action-adventure-set-in-a-magical-realist-american-south">South Of Midnight</a>, a third-person action adventure from Compulsion Games, who created dystopian Britpop survival game We Happy Few. I thought We Happy Few had some wonderful ideas and presentation - it's sort of Fable by way of Clockwork Orange and Bioshock - but found its mixture of pill-popping satire and survival game mechanisms self-defeating. South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence. Still, don't just sit there reading my opinions. Watch the trailer.

To give a quick summary of all that, you play Hazel, a witchy warrior who is trapped in a "Southern Gothic world where reality and fantasy are interwoven, and ancient creatures from folklore emerge". Some of these creatures are friendly, like the drawling ornamental catfish who appears happy to serve as your noble steed. And some of them are unfriendly, like the moving island over in the distance there that is actually a massive, overgrown alligator. Closer at hand, there's some kind of twisty treeboss with glowing red weakpoints for you to dart around and combo. 
</p>
<p>
South Of Midnight's fisticuffs and exploration seem pretty familiar, but it has style. They've gone with an artfully juddery set of character animations that mimic stop motion films, a la Into The Spider-Verse. Hazel can also air-dash and glide using pop-out spooky parachutes. And then there's the woozy, dreamy guitar music, which kicks up towards the finish just before Hazel finally confronts that marauding islandgator.
</p>
<p>
Again, the game feels like more of a genre piece than Compulsion's previous creations but if it has a good story wrapped around it and doesn't turn out to be a massive swamp level, I'll probably get along with it. I hope the game's snazzy (I know, I'm old) character animations are but the first of several mildly experimental visual flourishes, though I suspect they'll prove divisive - I'm reminded a bit of Sable, whose character movement gave me nausea (again, I'm old).

        <p>With more than a dozen jobs to perform</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I love me a Flight Simulator, but never more when there's some dramatic structure to my flight. That's why I've long been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>. It takes the staggeringly detailed world and flight model of Asobo's Flight Sim revival, and adds a job system on top. And now it has a release date: November 19th.

<p>We already knew that a lot of these jobs would be present, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-sequel-adds-more-than-a-dozen-new-aerial-jobs-in-2024">the announcement last year</a>, but even still there's a surprising quantity of them. Commercial flight! Sky advertising! Crop duster! Air ambulance! Emergency rescue! VIP charter service! And on, and on.
</p>
<p>Flight Sim's development team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-will-not-have-gamey-missions-because-we-are-not-a-game">clarified last year that these would not be "game-y" missions</a>, because Flight Simulatir is "not a game". Instead, they're designed to be simulations in the way the rest of the game is, and Asobo are working with organisations that perform these duties around the world to make it as accurate as possible.
</p>
<p>Fingers crossed it's still a <em>little</em> game-y, though. I love the rigour with which Flight Sim crafts its simulation, but then I like to clown around within it.

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased </a>by various rumors, a new Gears was indeed announced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024, but it's actually titled Gears of War: E-Day. The in-engine trailer shows Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago dealing with the Locust menace for the first time ever on Emergency Day. As such, it can be considered a prequel to the previous games.</p>
<p><em>Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas.​ </em><br>
<em>Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself. ​</em></p>

<p>Developer The Coalition was one of the first triple-A gaming studios to switch to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. However, the studio tinkered with some side projects that were <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-the-coalition-full-focus-side-projects-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only fairly recently set aside for Gears 6</a>.</p>
