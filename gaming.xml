            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the firing of 30 employees last week and accusations that this was an attempt to stymie efforts by employees to unionise, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rockstar">Rockstar</a> has issued a statement that says the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a Rockstar spokesperson said, “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>


<p>All of the affected employees – with 30 to 40 people fired from across the company’s studios in the UK and Canada – were part of a private trade union chat on Discord. There were outsiders within this chat, but they were there from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) as labor organisers.</p>
<p>Following the dismissals last week, the <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a> as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>
<p>Marshall has responded to Rockstar’s new allegations to say the company is&nbsp;“afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritising union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.”</p>

<p data-component="paragraph">Rockstar has always been a very secretive studio, something that goes hand-in-hand with the popularity of their games to make leaks of their work huge news stories. For GTA 6, the game has had two very high-profile leaking moments, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/19/rockstar-games-releases-statement-on-gta-6-leak/">a 2022 hack</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/02/gta-6-leak-rockstar-employee/">the friend of an employee’s son leaking more screens and details in 2023</a>. That latter moment was quickly followed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/rockstar-plans-full-return-to-office-for-gta-6-developers-citing-security-and-productivity/">Rockstar calling employees to return to offices for work</a>, having necessarily loosened this requirement and allowed work from home since 2020 – we all know why that was…</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto 6 is expected to release on 26th May 2026, as Rockstar eventually decided that they needed more time, despite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two execs constantly stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>. But that’s been good news for 2025’s slate of releases, so where games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> had been fairly tentative about launching this year, they could launch with more confidence. That game’s knocked it out of the park, as well, no doubt helped just a little by not having to compete with GTA 6 for the average gamer’s wallet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the most controversial entries in the series to date, and the massive backlash the game received not only threw Ubisoft off, but also had an impact on the game's development.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, during a meeting of video game industry insiders held last week at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft addressed the controversy surrounding the latest entry in the series, starting with a video that recapped how the game evolved into one that everyone loved to hate. At the end, the video revealed Ubisoft's approach to the controversy: it stopped focusing on the haters. This caused the game to be delayed for additional polish, as the publisher focused on appealing to the series fan that would, in turn, defend the game in the culture war that stemmed from its controversial choices.</p>



<p><em>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,"</em> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added after the short video ended. <em>"And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</em></p>



<p>If Ubisoft indeed managed to convincingly demonstrate that Assassin's Creed Shadows is more a game than a message, it's not yet clear at this moment, as no official sales data for the game has been provided by the publisher. It definitely seems to have done well at least in Europe, as it was reported back in August that the <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-no1">latest entry in the series was the best-selling new game of 2025 in Europe</a>, beating competition like Monster Hunter Wilds and Mario Kart World.</p>



<p>Although some of the controversies that surrounded the game before launch were justified, and the choice of protagonist and historical inaccuracies can be a turn-off, Assassin's Creed: Shadows is not a bad game at all. You can learn how it refines the formula of its RPG predecessors by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which google reliably informs me is a vehicle that's supposed to carry fighting infantry, rather than fight infantry itself, has had its lock-on missiles taken away for the next little bit. Some problems with countermeasures have rendered them far too effective at their job of blowing stuff up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA have confirmed the temporary switching off of these missiles in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986379990624088520">post on the hellsite</a>, putting it down to a need to "address inconsistencies witnessed with this vehicle's countermeasures". That appears to be code for countermeasures designed to prevent the likes of jets and tanks being blown to bits a bit too often and from across the map <a href="https://x.com/NerosCinema/status/1979681088399393159">not always doing their job properly</a> to have a chance of stopping the IFV's missiles in their tracks.</p>
<p>So, no missiles for now, with EA aiming to fix the problem in an update set to drop next week. In the meantime, maybe make missile lock and firing noises with your mouth whenever you spot a plane or chopper you'd like to knock out of the sky.</p> 
<p>Based on a <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986043954106626391">post</a> from DICE lead producer David Sirland last night, that next patch will also include fixes for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355">rooftop exploits</a> on maps like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and Empire State. These have been seeing pesky players use drones to spirit themselves up to high ground they shouldn't be able to reach, by standing atop the tech and whacking it with a sledgehammer in a fashion that weirdly remind me of the hand-cranked mine carts you get in westerns.</p><p>All of this comes as the devs continue to fiddle around with how much XP is dished out and required by certain activities, with a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229">revamp of challenges and assignments</a> having arrived yesterday. "Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length," EA said of those tweaks.</p>
<p>We'll see how many of these sorts of ongoing issues and gripes end up being locked onto and wiped out by that upcoming patch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played Battlefield 6 online and willingly attempted to complete challenges, you’ve probably come across a fair few with difficult requirements—borderline impossible ones. EA and Battlefield Studios have rectified this with over 90 tweaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has countless Initiation objectives and other challenges spread across the game. This relates to Classes, specific weapons, game modes, and much more. If you’ve spent a ton of time on one or more challenges to no avail, you might finally be in luck.</p>



<h2 id="h-say-goodbye-to-annoying-battlefield-6-challenge-requirements">Say Goodbye To Annoying Battlefield 6 Challenge Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can see the light. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battlefield Comms message confirms that “A total of 90+ adjustments to Challenges and Assignments” have been made—and they are active in-game right now.</p>



<p>Here are a few examples of the affected challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>“<strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon. Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>



<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support. Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>



<li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest. Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>



<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives. Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This list is exhaustive, to be quite honest. Engineers will be greatly pleased to hear that the infamous Engineer Specialist 3 challenge has been reduced. Repairing 6,000 Vehicle Health in one match has been slashed to just 1,000!</p>



<p>Also, many in the community are reporting that once matches are being completed, and challenges where you’ve now met the requirements (because of the reductions) are being unlocked automatically. Now’s the perfect time to start playing BF 6, and we have the best way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">buy Battlefield 6 for cheap</a>.</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of challenges suddenly start being completed and popping up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should it have taken this long to make such adjustments? Or is it better late than never, as previous BF games might have done?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet is right around the corner, offering hours of entertainment, and we’ve got all the details on multiplayer and co-op in the title.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet has already achieved huge success in China, where it initially launched in December 2024, and is poised to make a global debut on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, launching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on PC and as a console exclusive on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>



<p>Multiplayer is a huge component of modern gaming, though it isn’t always present, and we’ve got all the details on the multiplayer situation in Where Winds Meet.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-online-multiplayer">Does Where Winds Meet Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of options. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet offers various multiplayer modes, including PvP and campaign dungeons.</strong></p>



<p>The matchmaking social hub can host up to 30 players simultaneously, while campaign dungeons range in degrees of difficulty and support either five or 10 players.</p>



<p>There are also various multiplayer-only challenges spread across the map, though these are entirely optional and can be avoided.</p>



<p>In fact, all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet is entirely optional, and if you’d prefer a solely single-player adventure, there will still be over 100 hours of content to enjoy as a solo player.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-where-winds-meet-have-co-op">Does Where Winds Meet Have Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Where Winds Meet supports online co-op for up to four players, while campaign dungeons raise that figure to either five or 10 players working together, depending on the difficulty of the dungeon.</strong></p>



<p>Co-op mode allows players to explore the world together, searching for historic traces, defeating bosses, solving puzzles, and participating in events.</p>



<p>All players in the session will receive rewards for first-time completion of side story or campaign tasks, while players within a certain range will receive rewards for solving puzzles.</p>



<p>There are some restrictions, however, as only certain quest items owned by the host are visible and usable, but all items will be restored to normal when you return to your own world.</p>



<p>Like all multiplayer in Where Winds Meet, co-op is optional and isn’t required, with the game offering plenty to solo players who don’t want to join up with others to tackle the world—though it can help to open a co-op lobby if you’re struggling with a specific boss.</p>

            <p>Good news: the second part of the Ark animated television show has reappeared, having once been promised for the latter part of 2024 but never materialising. The bad news: it's been officially delayed.</p>
<p>However, it's not a ridiculous wait we're facing. Part 2 of the Ark: The Animated Series will apparently air sometime in 2026, <a href="https://x.com/survivetheark/status/1986271568406946168">according to the Ark X account</a>. "Thank you for your patience," the tweet ended.</p>

<p>palaeontologist Helena Walker, who suddenly found herself - like a player in the game - awake on an island filled with dinosaurs. Not a bad set of circumstances given her profession, although, you know, with the possible danger of death. The second part of the series will continue Helena's journey as she apparently "levels-up to learn the truth", said the Ark X account. (That it's all a game?)</p><p>The TV series had a surprisingly star-studded cast, including Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh, not-a-good-singer-but-a-great-gladiator Russell Crowe, Elliott Page, Karl Urban, David Tenant and many more. I haven't seen it myself but aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes tells me the series had a middling response.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-developer-acknowledges-missing-in-action-sequel">Delays have become something of a taint for the Ark series in general</a>, the most notable being for the big game-sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>, which was once promised for 2023 but then disappeared. A recently released expansion, Ark: Lost Colony - which follows Michelle Yeoh's character from the TV series - was released in June as a way to bridge the gap until the sequel reappears.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Painkiller is a series I’ve certainly heard of, but I couldn’t tell you either way whether or not I’ve played it. I must have at some point, I’m sure, because I played every single thing I could get my hands on, but I can’t actually remember doing so. What I do remember that it’s similar to Doom, including all the hellish monsters and environments. You enter a room, kill a legion of monsters, then move onto the next room, where another legion awaits your bullets. This co-op reboot of this two decade old series gets this right, at least, but it’s a bit uninspired because of this.</p>
<p><iframe title="Painkiller - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQjQKqzSssk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will start with the good stuff. Painkiller looks pretty good, the environments are cool in that heavy metal album cover sort of way, full of large ominous bits that trigger the imagination. The music, whilst perhaps a little on the generic side of metal background tunes, does its job of getting the blood pumping whilst you’re wading through demons well enough.</p>


<p>The best part of the game is the gunplay, gun customisation, and traversal though. There are a few guns here, though not nearly as many as you’d hope, but the two starting weapons are real highlights. The first is a stake gun, which shoots a large wooden spike and can be upgraded to pierce through enemies or shoot three stakes at a time, both of which make it incredibly satisfying to use. The second gun fires shurikens that bounce off surfaces and can be upgraded to ricochet off enemies into others nearby and is, again, incredibly enjoyable once you’ve got an upgrade.</p>
<p>The unlockable weapons include slightly more standard weapons like a shotgun, an SMG, a handcannon, and a rocket launcher, but with similar, very powerful upgrades that make them enjoyable to use. That said, after using the stake thrower with the three stakes upgrade, it felt a lot like using the shotgun once I unlocked it, and the stake thrower with the impaling upgrade feels quite a bit like the handcannon.</p>


<p>These guns also have a secondary fire which, when used on bigger enemies with proper health bars, will fill up their stun meter. Once that’s full, you can charge over and completely obliterate them with your one remaining weapon: the Painkiller. It’s effectively a chainsaw, even if it’s more of a spinning shuriken on a stick, and in addition to shredding anything that comes near it, it also generates ammo from enemies it kills. This is handy, of course, because you’re in deep trouble if you run out of ammo when one of the bigger enemies turns up. Clever use of the Painkiller, which has a cooldown for use without stunning an enemy first, and secondary fire can very quickly shred through a bigger enemy’s health bar, which is very satisfying to do.</p>
<p>As for traversal, you can’t sprint, but you can slide. Functionally this works very similarly but is faster when going down hill, slower when going up hill, and knocks enemies out of the way in a comical fashion when there’s a lot of them around. You also have a dodge button, which has two charges that each have a cooldown, that also knocks enemies out of the way. The combination of this movement system and powerful, creative weapons is a great one, making you feel truly powerful even whilst you’re desperately fighting for your life against a horde of beasties. It really can be enjoyable whilst you’re in the thick of all the chaos. One issue in traversal is grapple points not triggering when they should, or sometimes missing your enemy with the Painkiller, which is strange and can catapult you off ledges.</p>

<p>It’s a shame, really, that nothing else in the game lives up to these features. Level design is dull and generic, relying strongly on the kind of mechanics you see in an MMO, like killing enemies within a certain area, or around a barrel that collects their blood that can be shoved into a socket to progress once filled. Or perhaps that <em>totally different</em> mechanic where the barrel collects souls instead. These mechanics even turn up in boss fights, which are messy to say the least and sometimes devolve into frustration.</p>
<p>There are the most basic of basic puzzles dotted through the levels that require two people to get through occasionally – i.e. one to stand on a button and one to go through the door it opens, which usually have a cache of “loot,” if you can call it that as there’s really only four options, gold, health, ammo, and a lure that attracts enemies until they’ve depleted its health.</p>
<p>There are four characters, but beyond their designs – especially Void who seems to have a starfield for a face – and some brief dialogues between them during gameplay, they’re not particularly interesting mechanically or storywise. They each have a particular stat boost that is small enough to be nearly irrelevant, and the story here is almost non-existent. You are in purgatory for various crimes, but Metatron (the biblical voice/scribe of god) offers you a way out, by stopping the fallen angel Azazel from unleashing his demonic hordes onto Earth. You do this by fighting them across three areas, each split into three levels with a boss, and then Azazel. That’s the whole game.</p>

<p>There’s also a tarot card system that mostly seems superfluous because, whilst you’re still unlocking and upgrading your weapons, you spend the resources on doing that, and once you’re done upgrading your weapons, you’ve got little-to-no game left to use them in. The cards can give you useful bonuses such as increased health, quicker secondary fire regen, but I barely used them because they use the same resources to unlock and, once you’ve used a card once, it’s burnt and you have to restore it using the same resources. Not if you died or failed a level whilst using it, just every single time you use it.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft have reportedly offered a corporate spin on the backlash <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> faced from right-wing grifters prior to release, with CEO Yves Guillemot framing it as "a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message". The company also seem to be trying to canonise the events as some kind of masterful marketing victory, which arguably isn't too surprising, even if the fact they're not trying to pretend the controversy never happened is. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">Game File</a>, a marketing video about the backlash was shown during last week's Paris Games Week, with Guillemot subsequently making some comments further outlining how the corp - at least in terms of image they're aiming to present to industry event attendees - have chosen to interpret what happened in hindsight.</p>
<p>"We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies," the video declared. "We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks," Guillemot said afterwards, according to Game File's translation. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message."</p>
<p>Aside from that, which <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda-ubisoft-ceo-tries-to-mollify-gamers-who-wont-stop-being-mad-about-a-black-samurai-in-assassins-creed-shadows/">mirroring what the exec said</a> at the height of the controversy, the narrative being conveyed by the presentation looks to have been that Ubisoft scored a win by smartly opting to delay the game to polish it more and running a charm offensive along the lines of 'come on folks, this is just Assassin's Creed, you all like that'.</p><p>On one hand, it's exactly how you'd expect a company to paint a their response to what was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-warn-staff-not-to-celebrate-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-as-part-of-anti-harassment-plan">overwhelmingly a lot of online dickheads</a> being angry that Yasuke existed, was black, was a samurai, and was in a video game. On the other, it's sigh-inducing that this retelling seemingly left out or minimised elements like how Assassin's Creed lead Marc-Alexis Coté, who's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft</a>, actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">defended his team's vision</a> for the game, in contrast to Guillemot's declaration that it was just a bit of brains-off entertainment.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancelled-an-assassins-creed-set-in-post-civil-war-america-due-to-us-politics-and-yasuke-backlash">reported cancellation</a> of an Assassin’s Creed set in post-Civil War America back in 2024, over execs' concerns about the US' current political climate. Apparently that was one battle in which Ubisoft didn't back themselves to "fire up allies" and defeat what the marketing video reportedly called "the loudest haters".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dante’s Inferno 2 was expected to be the successor to EA’s new hack-and-slash franchise at the time. For whatever reason, it never happened, and it’s been on the shelf for the last 15 years. While some bits and pieces have come out over the years, we’ve now gotten a proper look at the canceled ‘Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio’&nbsp;title.</p>



<p>Dante’s Inferno was touted as the next big hack-and-slash game to rival the likes of God of War and Devil May Cry—it also looked and played a lot like the former. We used it in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-to-play-like-ninja-gaiden-4-top-hack-and-slash-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best games to play like Ninja Gaiden 4 list</a>, and despite the God of War comparisons, Dante’s Inferno reviewed decently, sold respectably, before a potential Dante’s Inferno 2 disappeared off the face of the Earth…until now.</p>



<h2 id="h-dante-s-inferno-2-would-have-been-the-second-game-in-a-trilogy">Dante’s Inferno 2 Would Have Been The Second Game In A Trilogy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dante of War. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Dante’s Inferno saw Dante—a Templar Knight—battle through horrible monsters and bosses through the Nine Circles of Hell. Its combat, nifty camera angles, puzzles, and bosses were reminiscent of God of War.</p>



<p>A full report from IGN has dug deep into history and uncovered many lost tidbits about Dante’s Inferno 2. It includes screenshots, concept drawings, and how the game’s story would unfold—as well as a third game!</p>



<p>‘<strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio</strong>‘ was the official title for the second game. IGN says it had: “A 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio.”</p>



<p>The sequel would also have shifted away from the God of War influences and looked to forge its own identity.</p>



<p>IGN’s report outlines and details every single level throughout the game, with the Seven Sins being a huge aspect, and how Dante would climb Mount Purgatory. Furthermore: “Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include <strong>co-op and multiplayer modes</strong>.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>What a ride it could’ve been. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another document uncovered finds that the sequel’s conclusion would set up the events of “Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso.” You can check out more details and screenshots in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>‘s full findings.</p>

            <p>Set photos from the upcoming Resident Evil film from Weapons director Zach Cregger show a very snowy Raccoon City.</p>
<p>Filming for the adaptation kicked off earlier this year in Prague, and now thanks to <a href="https://www.praguereporter.com/home/2025/11/3/photos-resident-evil-blankets-pragues-karlin-neighborhood-in-snow-for-key-action-scene/">The Prague Reporter</a> we can all take a little peek at what Cregger is cooking up for us all. The snow dusting the streets on the set suggests that the film will be set during the winter season in Raccoon City, a key location in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">lends credence to an earlier rumour regarding the adaptation's plot</a> (I won't spoil it here).</p>

<p>As you can see in the images below, Cregger's take on Resident Evil features an establishment called Oak Street Diner. This could be a little nod to Tall Oaks, a town in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>. One of the bus signs also points to Central Station, which pops up in the games.</p>
<p>"In the Karlín neighborhood of Prague 8, an action scene involving snow, gunfire, explosions, and fast driving was filmed from Oct. 29-Nov. 2," the publication wrote. "Residents and visitors passing through the area were greeted with a light cover of snow throughout the week as production on Resident Evil took place primarily during the night hours."</p>

</figure>
<p>Cregger previously confirmed his take on the Resident Evil film will tell an original story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">but will still be "true to the experience of the games"</a>. At this time, he added the film "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3. That being said, Cregger said his adaptation "adheres more to the tone of 4". The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">filmmaker has not seen any of the previous Resident Evil film adaptations himself</a>.</p>
<p>Cregger - whose other work includes 2022's Barbarian, which our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">was first announced to be helming the next Resident Evil movie in March of this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Resident Evil film is expected to be released on 18th September, 2026.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/DAVE-THE-DIVER-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2957273.html">eShop listing</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition offers "higher resolution and improved frame rates", while the content of the game remains unchanged between the consoles. Dave's diving escapades didn't feel like they <em>needed</em> a boost in this department, but smoother swimming is always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>Those with Dave the Diver on Switch 1 can upgrade to this new version for free. Alternatively, you can pick up the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> (a discount on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> brings that down to $11.99 until 13th November).</p>
<p>Developer Mintrocket teased that the update would be coming "soon" back in June, so it's nice to see that promise finally materialise.</p>
<p>We awarded Dave the Diver an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dave-the-diver">our review</a>, calling it one of the few 2023 games "that rivals <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>'s all-out density and charm while doing something almost completely new". If you still haven't dived in, now might be a good excuse to do so.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of the biggest and most anticipated releases on the horizon in 2025, and we’ve got all the details on when you can preload the game to jump into the action.</p>



<p>After achieving vast success in China, Where Winds Meet <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases globally on November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and PlayStation 5</a> as a console exclusive title, with millions of players already pre-registering for the game.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement and want to preload Where Winds Meet in advance so you can dive straight into the game on launch, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-where-winds-meet">When Can You Preload Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nearly there. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available from November 12 at 2 PM PT, NetEase has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</strong></p>



<p>This gives you plenty of time to download Where Winds Meet in advance for launch, and preloading is recommended due to the large file size and the fact that servers will likely be stretched by an influx of players the moment the game goes live.</p>



<p>The table below shows when preloads for Where Winds Meet will be available in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Preload Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Nov. 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Nov. 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-file-size-explained">Where Winds Meet File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Exact file sizes for Where Winds Meet depend on your platform, with PC users having several options to download, while PlayStation 5 has a single version.</strong></p>



<p>Users on PC have three different versions to choose from, with the Lite version clocking in at 68 GB, the Standard version requiring around 100 GB of space, and the Ultimate version requiring 120 GB—though the Ultimate version of the game may not be available immediately.</p>



<p>For PlayStation 5 players, the download size is around 108 GB total, and there are no other options for the download. </p>



<p>Bear in mind that these sizes are subject to change and could increase with day-one patches.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-where-winds-meet">How to Preload Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to preload Where Winds Meet, you can do so by visiting your platform store once the preload has been made available.</strong></p>



<p>On Steam, simply search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the store and find the preload option, which is available without needing to spend any additional cash due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title’s free-to-play status</a>.</p>



<p>The approach on PlayStation 5 is similar, requiring you to search for ‘Where Winds Meet’ in the PS Store, though make sure you click the right version, as there is a paid-for pre-order edition that provides additional rewards. If you just want the free-to-play version, make sure you select it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has said he’d feel more sad to learn Red Dead Redemption 3 was in development without him than he feels about GTA 6, but admits the game “will probably happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2018 epic western <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is considered a masterpiece and one of the greatest video games of all time. Houser was lead writer on it, as he was for almost all Rockstar’s games. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta">having left the company over five years ago</a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar">GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=kMAZuzpS5Xxkb3mm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Houser has indicated that he’d have stronger feelings when Rockstar inevitably returns to Red Dead Redemption with a follow-up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20 odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Red Dead Redemption 3 an inevitability? Houser seems to think the Red Dead Redemption series will continue, but it’s worth noting that the series began with Red Dead Revolver in 2004, so perhaps Rockstar will create a new sub-series if and when it decides the time is right for more Red Dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, in 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the focus very much is on GTA 6, due out May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

When not in use, the MCon measures just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, to make it easy to store in your pocket. It's available to preorder in white or black.</p></div>                      </div><p>The MCon was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign that blew past its initial funding goal of $25,000, earning over $1.7 million in crowdfunding. Part of the appeal for the device is that it has a user-friendly design, as manufacturer Oh Snap designed it to be moddable, upgradeable, and repairable. Smartphone controllers have become popular over the last couple of years, thanks in part to subscription services like Netflix and Crunchyroll offering a library of games for members to access, and there are several brands out there that offer high-quality add-ons like this.</p><p>One of the biggest is Backbone, as it currently sells controllers that are also portable and make mobile gaming a more pleasant experience. The company recently announced a collaboration with Hideo Kojima's studio to produce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-new-death-stranding-2-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-from-the-games-world/1100-6535766/" data-ref-id="1100-6535766">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Backbone controller</a>, but if you're in a rush, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One with a USB-C connection</a> is available for $100, and for older iPhones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Backbone One with a Lightning connection</a> is available at the same price.</p><p>The Backbone Ones have a solid design, but if you're looking for a more premium controller with better parts inside, the company's premium smartphone controller--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>--is worth considering, with Hall Effect triggers, quiet face buttons, and full-sized ALPS analog sticks.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/battlefield-6s-challenges-just-got-a-lot-easier-to-do/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-challenges-just-got-a-lot-easier-to-do.1345393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have made a set of sweeping changes to the in-game Challenges and Assignments in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, making them much easier to complete, which should be music to the ears of time-starved fans of the game.</p>
<p>When they made changes to the XP earned and reduced ranking requirements shortly after launch, they also stated that they would be addressing complaints over some of the overly lengthy requirements for Challenges and Assignments, which many players felt were overly burdensome.</p>


<p>The first set of changes have now gone live with a sever-side update, and are retroactive to progress already made. This are applied the first time you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet. This is great news, but doesn’t necessarily fix some of the inconsistencies in the core gameplay and tracking itself. Things like getting suppression on enemies were horrible for Support class players not just because of the huge numbers required to succeed, but because they weren’t registering properly – also, it’s not clear what suppression really does, as it definitely doesn’t affect sniper aim!</p>
<p>But this is still a positive step for the game’s regular progression, letting it get out of the way of the new grind of battle pass missions and more. Now, if only there was a way to just rule out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">battle royale mode</a> quests, that would be nice, because I’m maybe never going to play that…</p>
<p>The team highlighted the following examples:</p>

<p><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assault 2:</strong> Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p>
<p>All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p>
<p>The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conquest 2:</strong> Wins in Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conquest 3:</strong> Objective kills in a round of Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p>
<p>General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>"They're just speaking the language of video games"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Dan Houser, former GTA boss and co-founder of Rockstar Games, recently took to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTU7xLbSrw">Lex Fridman Podcast</a> to talk about his personal history and the games industry at large (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/former-gta-boss-dan-houser-says-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-or-the-kingdom-are-like-alfred-hitchcock-films-theyre-just-speaking-the-language-of-video-games/">Games Radar+</a>).</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned to Nintendo when the pair began to speak about early 3D games. Fridman notes that Nintendo has a particular level of polish in which "every pixel has a purpose", with the company expertly "delivering a pure gaming experience".</p>
<p>Houser agreed, and when they got onto the more recent open-world Zelda entries – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> – he states that they "feel like [Alfred] Hitchcock" in their design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The new ones, they almost, to me, feel like Hitchcock. They're just speaking the language of video games. You know, like, you know everything's going to work this way and that way – it's quite systemic, but how it all glues together is so amazing.</p>
<p>"It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality, he's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong accent. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.</p>
<p>"And that's what those Zelda games kinda feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a pretty apt comparison to us! Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have certainly earned their fair share of praise over the years, but this might be the first time we've heard them compared to Hitchcock – it certainly makes sense, though.</p>
<p>Dan Houser is, of course, no longer at Rockstar Games, which itself is gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in 2026. Houser went on to form Absurd Ventures with an aim to create new IP across video games, books, movies, comics, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Throughout its 21 years on the market, World of Warcraft has often been subject to rumors that it would be ported to consoles. A couple of years ago, for the first time, franchise VP Holly Longdale <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-on-consoles-is-still-a-possibility-of-course-we-talk-about-it-were-microsoft-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> they had been talking to Microsoft about the possibility following the former company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>However, World of Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas has now denied fan theories that some of the accessibility changes coming with the next expansion, Midnight, are geared toward eventually porting the MMORPG to consoles. Answering a question from Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Unshackled Fury podcast</a>, Hazzikostas said:</p>



<p><em>It is not. To be fully transparent, there's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing World of Warcraft to consoles or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying: 'We're actively working towards it. We know we have a lot of work to do, but it's a place where we want to land.' Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience. I think a lot of these changes, as a package, are about approachability broadly. World of Warcraft is an incredibly complex game. I know there's members of the community who celebrate that complexity, but I think there's a big difference between having a very high skill ceiling in a game, having a tremendous amount of depth, and just having complexity. I think our goal has always been, Blizzard's goals have always been, with all of our games, to have them be easy to learn and nearly impossible to master. And I think a lot of our changes in World of Warcraft Midnight are aimed at improving the easy to learn side of that spectrum.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I have played a little of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Midnight Alpha</a>, and the game is still far from being accessible enough to be playable with a gamepad. There are still way too many skills and buttons to press compared to games like Final Fantasy XIV and The Elder Scrolls Online, which were designed from the get-go to be available on consoles. Personally, I believe a truly massive rework would be required to make it truly playable on consoles, and I don't think the studio is entirely sure it would be worth the effort. As such, I doubt it will ever happen.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight doesn't have a release date yet, but a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> it could launch in February 2026. In other Blizzard news, early bird tickets for BlizzCon 2026 <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will go on sale tomorrow</a>. </p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is whistling onto the scene, and there are a bunch of pre-registration rewards available to earn to begin your journey. We’ve got all the details on the rewards and how they are claimed within the title.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Where Winds Meet has achieved vast success in China, where it initially released on PC in December 2024, and is now launching globally on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and as a PlayStation 5 console exclusive</a>.</p>



<p>Pre-registration rewards in Where Winds Meet are available to players on both platforms, and we’ve got the full breakdown on everything there is to claim.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-where-winds-meet-pre-registration-rewards">All Where Winds Meet Pre-Registration Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pre-registration rewards for Where Winds Meet are unlocked as a community goal, with each stage of rewards requiring a total number of pre-registrations to be secured.</strong></p>



<p>At the time of writing, all but one of the pre-registration rewards have been unlocked, with four rewards available for players. However, the final reward, the Swaying Lotus Skin, is yet to be unlocked and requires a total of 10 million pre-registrations to be distributed to players.</p>



<p>The rewards available for pre-registration are cosmetic or currency-related, though the first two have not been detailed fully and are merely indicated as ‘gifts’ for now.</p>



<p>All the pre-registration rewards available for Where Winds Meet are detailed in the table below, along with their community goal requirements.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-pre-registration-rewards-in-where-winds-meet">How to Claim Pre-Registration Rewards in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>All redeemable rewards in Where Winds Meet are not automatically added to your inventory and must be claimed manually using the in-game Letter system.</strong></p>



<p>The Letters feature is accessible from the main menu within the game as an option to select on the right-hand side of the same screen where you can change your gear and skills, view quests, and change appearance.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on your Letters in-game, too, as there will be a bunch of rewards to claim throughout your progression in the game.</p>

            <p>Bad Brain Game Studios, founded by former Ubisoft developers including those who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>, will be shutting down on the 17th November. The studio has been unable to acquire necessary funding after Netease pulled the plug.</p>
<p>A sizzle reel for Bad Brain's upcoming game Midnight Riders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">was uploaded to the company's LinkedIn page</a>, alongside a statement from the studio about the closure as well as an emphasis that the IP remains available for "acquisition or partnership".</p>
<p>The statement reads: "Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent."</p>

<p>It continues: "The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you."</p><p>This marks the latest in a long string of studio woes as a direct result of Netease's withdrawal from Western game development. It was only last month that Fantastic Pixel Castle announced it'll shut down for the same reason, as did T-Minus Zero back in September.</p>
<p>According to Bad Brain Game Studios' LinkedIn page, the company employs between 11-50 employees, all of which will be out of work during an especially treacherous period in the video game industry.</p>

		<p>November is The Simpsons month in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with a big collaboration and cross-over event that includes animated shorts, a whole new island, cel shaded graphics and a whole host of beloved The Simpsons characters to play as. That’s proven to be pretty darned popular, with Epic touting a big batch of new and returning players, to an extent not seen since last year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Welcome to Springfield - Fortnite | The Simpsons" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqQDlH9ztL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on <a href="https://xcancel.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624">social media</a>, Epic confirmed that “In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning Fortnite players since last holiday season. The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ Today in the US. Move over Shelbyville…”</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20251105">fortnite.gg</a> that amounts to a peak of almost 2.7 million concurrent players, though this figure needs a good bit of context. For one thing, the all-time peak player count is the 14.34 million that turned up for the Fortnite Remix: The Finale live event to close out Chapter 2 Remix on 30th November 2024. It also doesn’t mean the highest player counts of this year, which came close to 6 million in June and have had peaks for other events. Noting that it’s “new and returning” players means that it’s lapsed gamers, as opposed to those that will regularly drop in for a game or two. The real impact needs to be for the</p>
<p>Fortnite’s cel-shaded event has brought with it a month of Simpsons related content. The headline act is the 80-player Springfield Island, which is a “back-to-basics” battle royale experience, with each week bringing new themed gameplay, shop offerings and more. There’s tons of hidden easter eggs and gags in the game to find, including three bosses to find and battle.</p>

<p>Tying in with that are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games and streaming on Disney+ and on Fortnite social channels. The first short immediately jumped to the top of Disney+ charts, with a new short coming every Monday from 10th November, leading into new gameplay on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>These episodes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – “Apocalypse D’Oh”</li>
<li>November 10 – “Sugar High”</li>
<li>November 17 – “Multiplidiocy”</li>
<li>November 24 – “The Incredible Bulk”</li>
</ul>

            <p>Here's something to sink your teeth into on a Thursday morning. An unscripted reality competition series based on the frantic co-op culinary game Overcooked is in the works at Netflix and A24. Yes, you butter believe it. </p>
<p>The news, which is kind of a big dill, was reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, which stated the show itself will follow a similar format to other family-friendly Netflix competition series such as Nailed It! and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the publication explained.</p>

<p>Netflix and A24's Overcooked series is currently said to be in the very early stages, with Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine and Phil Duncan from the game's developer Ghost Town all attached in a production role. These shows can be thyme-consuming to produce, so who knows when we will hear more about how it is all going to pan out. </p>
<p>As for the game itself, Overcooked was originally released back in 2016 with Eurogamer alum Johnny Chiodini branding it "farcical couch co-op at its finest".</p>
<p>"While Overcooked is a fast-paced and very exacting game, it's also a joyous one," they wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overcooked-review">Eurogamer's Overcooked review</a>. "The art style and animation are both delightful, keeping things on the right side of serious.</p>
<p>"While there'll doubtless be at least one person determined to appoint themselves de facto head chef, Overcooked is, simply put, a hilarious game to experience with a bunch of friends."</p>
<p>Will this hilariousness translate to TV and meat expectations?? I guess we will have to wait and find out if it was all worth the whisk. </p>

<p>Netflix is, of course, no stranger to video game adaptations. It's also home to anime like Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">which was recently announced to end with series two</a> - Devil May Cry and Arcane.</p>
<p>As for Overcooked's Ghost Town, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overcooked-developer-unveils-spooky-escape-room-style-co-op-adventure-stage-fright">last year the team announced it was working on a new project known as Stage Fright</a>. Described as a mix of "Overcooked style chaotic moments [and] escape room style cooperation", Stage Fright is designed for two players, and will be playable either as a couch co-op adventure or online.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Superhero workplace comedy Dispatch is currently proving - fairly convincingly - that episodic gaming can really work. Two new episodes of the choice-based narrative series arrived yesterday and propelled the series to even greater popularity than when it launched.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/">Dispatch's concurrent player-count yesterday peaked at 131,000 players on Steam</a> which, even taken alone, can be viewed as a significant success for a single-player narrative game. But it's when you consider that the numbers have doubled from the launch two weeks ago that the episodic format begins to flex. I expect the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">impressive 1m Dispatch sales tally</a> will soon be improved upon.</p>
<p>The sustained approach of releasing two episodes a week for four weeks is allowing word to circulate and an audience to build, creating something of a virtuous cycle around the game as people anticipate what will come next - a bit like what happens with a TV series. There's every chance, then, player-numbers could build as the Dispatch series reaches a climax next week (12th November).</p>
<p>That's not all that's going on, of course. Dispatch has the clout of Critical Role behind it, the role-play mega-group made up of now-celebrity voice actors, which is nominally listed as a publisher for the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">as I discovered when I spoke to Dispatch developer AdHoc recently</a>, hasn't really played a publisher's role. The partnership is really in place for the next game AdHoc will make - a Critical Role game.</p>

<figure>

<a aria-label="Dispatch | Episodes 5 &amp; 6 Preview" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidpOy-Zta4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Critical Role's influence is enormous and a few of the actors from the group are in the game - the award-winning Laura Bailey and husband Travis Willingham among them - and I've seen many of the group pushing Dispatch's release on social media. It's another example of the increasing presence and heft voice actors have in today's game-playing space - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2201320/view/496077392009233430?l=english">the success of this year's voice-actor-led dating game Date Everything!</a> being another example. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> also has strong Critical Role ties.</p><p>However, none of this would have been possible if Dispatch were rubbish, which by all accounts it is not, nor if we had to wait a long time between episode drops, which we do not. This is episodic gaming done well and the results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The film's listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> (FTIA) website has seen a status update this week, with the former "Pre-Production" stamp changing to the much more promising "In Production" — that's what we like to see.</p>
<p>The main filming location is listed on the site as Wellington, New Zealand, a common spot for bringing fantasy lands to the big screen, as previously used for <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy, <strong>Avatar</strong> and <strong>King Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>The FTIA provides the following project summary for the upcoming movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce—an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest.</p>

<p>Of course, we've known for a while that the Zelda movie would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/rumour-zelda-live-action-movie-will-reportedly-be-part-of-a-trilogy1">shooting in New Zealand</a> in November 2025, but it's exciting to see that production status change!</p>
<p>The film is set to release on 7th May 2027 — assuming there are no more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">delays</a>. The only casting that we know of so far is <strong>Renegade Nell</strong>'s Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and <strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong>'s Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, but we'd be surprised if we don't get a few more face reveals in the next year or so.</p>

                                        <p>Every decision counts in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. From the smallest lie in a conversation to the biggest choice between warring factions, every move you make ripples through the Arcadia colony--shifting alliances, rewriting quests, and redefining what kind of commander you are. Obsidian Entertainment’s latest sci-fi RPG doesn’t just tell you your choices matter--it makes you feel it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A colony on the brink</span></h2><p>Set in the new frontier of Arcadia, the sequel drops you into a world tearing itself apart. The Protectorate’s so-called benevolent rule is being challenged by rebels of a rising religious order, while opportunistic corporations close in to claim what’s left. As devastating rifts spread across the system, you’re tasked with uncovering their source--but who you trust (and who you betray) could decide whether Arcadia survives or collapses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Choices that echo through every mission</span></h2><p>In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, no two playthroughs will ever look the same. Dialogue choices can unlock alternate solutions, close off others, or completely change how characters respond to you later. Promise loyalty to a faction, and doors will open--but betray them, and those doors might slam shut for good. Even seemingly small moments, like a sarcastic quip or a quick act of mercy, can come back around hours later in surprising ways.</p><p>Obsidian’s trademark cause-and-effect storytelling is in full force here. You’re constantly juggling competing motivations--moral, political, and personal--as the colony reacts to your growing reputation. Maybe you’re a peacemaker trying to broker stability, or maybe you lean into chaos, playing every side until only yours is left standing. The brilliance lies in how the game never tells you which is right--it just lets you live with the fallout.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Relationships that remember</span></h2><p>Your companions are more than just party members--they’re witnesses to your leadership. They’ll react to your choices, question your motives, and sometimes even walk away if your ideals clash too deeply. The relationships you build (or burn) with them can alter entire questlines, shaping not only their stories but your own. Whether you lead with empathy, ambition, or pure self-interest, Arcadia, and the people in it, will remember.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A galaxy that bends to you</span></h2><p>Across its sprawling environments--from sun-scorched deserts to neon-drenched cities--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> keeps the focus on agency. Exploration feeds directly into consequence: the terminals you hack, secrets you uncover, and decisions you make along the way all inform how the colony evolves. There’s no “perfect” path through Arcadia, only the one you carve for yourself.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is available now as a day one release with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to shape their own version of Arcadia’s story.

                                        <p>For RPG fans, there’s nothing quite like the moment a new world opens up before you--when the menu fades, the music swells, and you realise you can go anywhere. Role-playing games have always offered that rare kind of escapism: the chance to step into a different life, shape your own story, and lose yourself in a universe that feels alive.</p><p>With <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, Obsidian Entertainment captures that feeling again--the thrill of exploration, the satisfaction of choice, and the joy of seeing a world shift around your actions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597826"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597826-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every corner of Arcadia tells a story worth discovering.</span></h2><p>Arcadia, the colony at the heart of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, feels like a place built for wandering. Every outpost, settlement, and alien landscape tells its own story. The conversations you overhear, the missions you stumble into, even the way the sky shifts above you--it all makes the world feel lived-in. There’s a sense of texture to everything, like the game wants you to slow down and take it in rather than rush to the next objective.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597827"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597827-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_03-extra_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Every build tells a different story about the kind of player you are</span></h2><p>Part of what makes RPGs so magnetic is the chance to decide who you’ll become. In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, you build your commander from the ground up--their look, their skills, their attitude. Some players might choose a smooth-talking diplomat who navigates danger through dialogue, while others prefer a stealthy tactician or a fearless brawler. However you play, your approach changes how the story unfolds and how the world responds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597828"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597828-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The story evolves around the paths you choose to take</span></h2><p>Every decision in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> feels like it matters. The alliances you form, the people you help, and the promises you break all ripple through Arcadia. Sometimes the effects are immediate. Other times they echo hours later, catching you off guard in ways that feel human. It’s that balance of consequence and curiosity that makes RPGs so rewarding -- the sense that your version of the story truly belongs to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597829"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597829-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_06_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>The Outer Worlds 2 captures what makes immersion feel so special</span></h2><p>At their best, RPGs give you space to disappear for a while--not to avoid reality, but to explore new ones. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> understands that pull completely. It builds a world worth escaping into, filled with choices that challenge you, characters that surprise you, and moments that stick long after you’ve logged off.</p><p>For anyone who loves rich storytelling and total creative freedom, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a must-play. It’s available day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to Arcadia and everything it holds. Whether you’re an Obsidian loyalist or new to the series, this is the kind of game that reminds you why RPGs have always been the most rewarding way to play--because they give you the space to explore, to imagine, and to make every world your own.</p><p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/the-outer-worlds-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2: Available now with Game Pass | Xbox</a></p>

                                        <p>The wait is finally over--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> has officially landed, and it’s every bit the interstellar adventure fans have been hoping for. From Obsidian Entertainment, the masters of sharp-tongued sci-fi and branching RPGs, this sequel catapults players into a brand-new colony--Arcadia--for a story filled with danger, discovery, and difficult choices that can change the fate of an entire galaxy.</p><p>Set in the far reaches of space, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> casts you as a daring (and, as the game cheekily reminds you, “most likely good-looking”) Earth Directorate agent tasked with investigating mysterious rifts tearing through reality. These fractures threaten humanity itself, and your mission to uncover their source leads you straight into Arcadia--a colony at war with itself. Here, the Protectorate’s iron-fisted rule is being challenged by rebellious religious orders and encroaching corporate powers. Every side claims to be saving the system, so it’s up to you to decide who to believe… or who to betray.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2>A new world, shaped by your choices</h2><p>At its heart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is everything fans loved about the original--moral grey areas, biting humour, and choices that actually matter--but turned up several notches. Every skill point, dialogue option, and faction alliance can shift how your story unfolds. Whether you’re a smooth-talking diplomat, a chaos-loving gunslinger, or someone who just likes to press every sarcastic response possible, Arcadia reacts in kind.</p><p>This time around, Obsidian gives you even more freedom to define your character. You can build your commander from the ground up--complete with unique strengths, flaws, and backstory traits that influence how others see you (and how you see yourself). Your abilities, decisions, and even your mistakes ripple out into the world, altering relationships and rewriting your path as the story progresses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A crew worth crossing galaxies for</span></h2><p>No space-faring hero travels alone, and the companions you recruit along the way bring their own secrets, loyalties, and motivations to the mix.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired between thirty and forty GTA developers </a>across its offices in Canada and the United Kingdom, triggering accusations by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) that the game studio sought to prevent their attempt to unionize. The IWGB claimed that all those developers were working to that end, and vowed to defend their rights through 'every legal claim possible'.</p>



<p>Initially, Rockstar Games only stated that they had been fired due to a rather generic 'gross misconduct'. Now, though, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received a more detailed statement from a company spokesperson</a>. The GTA and Red Dead Redemption developer claims these employees were 'found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum', in violation of Rockstar's policies. As such, the terminations had nothing to do with union busting, according to the spokesperson.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the IWGB isn't much convinced. Its president, Alex Marshall, replied with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Rockstar is afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</em></p>



<p>Currently, the IWGB <a href="https://x.com/IWGBunion/status/1986081909278212100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is protesting</a> outside Take-Two House, 30 Cleveland Street, London, in solidarity with the fired workers. </p>



<p>There are indeed multiple public forums dedicated to the Grand Theft Auto series, chiefly GTAForums, which is often a source of leaks. However, it doesn't seem like any significant leak was shared there or elsewhere recently. Still, Rockstar Games has taken a deadly serious approach to security following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alleged-gta-6-videos-schreier-its-likely-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big Grand Theft Auto VI leak</a> that occurred on September 18, 2022. A couple of months later, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-reaffirms-that-gta-6-leak-wont-influence-development-or-anything-of-the-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the leak would not affect the development of the game, but Rockstar (and Take-Two) aren't taking any chances now that the finish line is finally in sight.</p>



<p>Originally targeting a Fall 2025 launch window, the most hyped game of all time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now set to launch on May 26, 2026</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X. Of course, a delay could still happen, as shown by Rockstar's track record. Hopefully that won't be needed, especially as it would further delay the PC version (though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CEO of Corsair Gaming</a>, PC gamers might not have to wait as long as with previous franchise entries).</p>

            <p>Oi, gaffer! I know you're busy trying to work out the exact moment at which we should park the bus and start unleashing the long throw-ins, but you'll probably want to know about the chunky patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> devs Sports Interactive have released into Steam beta. It's aimed at fixing a lit of the initial issues which've been causing ire since release earlier this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update delivers over three hundred fixes and quality of life improvements," the studio wrote in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3551340/view/615431029997437073?l=english">Steam announcement</a> of this beta patch. "Key highlights include new preferences for adjusting attribute colours, a preference to turn off/alter the speed of UI transitions, as well as a 1.5x Match Speed option, all introduced in response to your early beta feedback."</p>
<p>Beyond those, some tweaks which've caught my eye include "substantial crash and stability fixes", "further fixes to matches Freezing at start of the second half in single-player career", and "manually scouting a player will now correctly delegate an appropriate scout". Alright, if I'm being honest, those ones just strike me as useful, the following really caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where white match ball would be used in snowy weather</li>
<li>Fixed issue forcing user to holiday past end of season team meeting</li>
<li>Overall start/until dates within Club &gt; Finances &gt; Debts &amp; Loans will no longer display 01/01/1900</li>
<li>Fixed issue where player would reject the own asking price that they themselves had set</li>
<li>Manager attire choices will now save correctly</li>
<li>'Exit Talks' button now functions correctly within Contract Negotiations</li>
</ul>
<p>This barrage of tweaks is just the start, with Sports Interactive revealing: "The next update for the beta track is already underway (details to follow), and it’s set to introduce a legacy preference to advance through messages with the spacebar, which we’ve been working on since the initial beta feedback came in."</p><p>So far Football Manager 26's critic reception <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/football-manager-26/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">looks pretty mixed</a>, while user reviews have skewed much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/#app_reviews_hash">more negatively</a>. We've got our own review in the works, so make sure to look out for that if you're taking the wait-and-see approach before donning your monogrammed tracksuit.</p>
<p>To give this beta patch a go, you'll need to head to the manage button on the game's listing in your Steam library, then properties, then betas, and select public beta from the private betas drop-down menu. It's the standard path you'll be familiar with if you're a veteran of Steam betas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few years ago, NetEase Games helped fund several game development studios based in Western countries and Japan. Over the last year, though, many of those were abruptly shut down in the middle of developing those projects that NetEase had expressed interest in the first place.</p>



<p>This includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a> (spearheaded by a Mass Effect writer, who was working with his team on a sci-fi action/adventure game), <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jar of Sparks</a> (founded by former Halo Infinite developers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouka Studios</a> (the only one to actually release their game, Visions of Mana, before being shut down), and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>. The former studio has received an unexpected second wind thanks to a few veterans and directors who decided to invest in retaining the name; the latter now has an expiration date of November 17, although founder Greg Street is still trying to secure funding until the last possible moment. </p>



<p>NetEase must have mandated that November 17 date, as it's the same expiration date that another developer, the Montréal-based Bad Brain Game Studios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicated a few hours ago in a LinkedIn post</a>. Sean Crooks, Studio Head and former Ubisoft developer on Watch Dogs games, is still trying to shop around the game they were working on, The Midnight Riders:</p>



<p><em>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</em></p>



<p>To help showcase their work, they shared a sizzle reel, which makes it look a lot like a proper Stranger Things game. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-brain-game-studios-qa-building-an-open-world-spielberg-ft-king-coming-of-age-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed Sean Crooks in June 2023</a>, he shared his vision for a 'Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King in an open world with a coming-of-age story'. The game was also clearly set in the 1980s.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are other studios whose fate is currently uncertain, such as Jackalyptic Games, which is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a Warhammer-based massively multiplayer online game</a>. Unfortunately, there has been no official update, only rumors that Jack Emmert and his team are also looking for another publisher. Even a high-profile hire such as Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has only been given enough resources to finish his game, and according to reports, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't even want to pay for its marketing anymore</a>.</p>

                <p>This year, Naughty Dog is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a studio, which had humble beginnings compared to its current status as one of Sony's most important first-party developers. Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin formed the company when they were still teenagers, and the foundation they built continues long after they left Naughty Dog. Now, Naughty Dog has shared a retrospective video for its 40th anniversary that revisits some of its greatest hits while looking ahead to the future.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_EIOxtOVY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rT_EIOxtOVY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gavin and Rubin discuss the company's earliest origins, which date back to their time in school. The video doesn't focus much on the company's largely forgotten early titles, including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior. Instead, it marks the debut of the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter franchises as a turning point for Naughty Dog.</p><p>From there, the retrospective moves on to the company's cinematic action era that began in 2007 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune/" data-ref-id="5000-26749">Uncharted</a>, and continues through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part 2</a> and the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. A few brief scenes from Intergalactic was shown as studio manager and head of operations Alison Mori said, "I know our studio will continue to create amazing story-driven, character-based games that touch upon the human experience."</p><p>"I hope the future holds more of what Naughty Dog has always done," added Rubin. "Being at the forefront of making entertainment that is of the highest possible quality, telling the stories it wants to tell, with depth and meaning."</p><p>Earlier this year, Gavin shared his opinion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-co-founder-says-one-simple-change-made-crash-bandicoot-remakes-worse/1100-6533250/" data-ref-id="1100-6533250">the change made to the Crash Bandicoot remakes</a> that made the games worse. Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-reveals-why-he-decided-to-leave-the-last-of-us-tv-show/1100-6534673/" data-ref-id="1100-6534673">stepped away from The Last of Us TV show</a> to focus on his work at the studio. Druckmann has since teased that Intergalactic has "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">the deepest gameplay we've ever done</a>." However, the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Arcades may be largely a thing of the past, but some of the bigger cabinets of the '90s offered players co-op battles and head-to-head match-ups that consoles of that era couldn't match. Now, one of those games, Namco's Tokyo Wars, is finally getting its first console port after debuting in 1996.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55XrAWvTksk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/55XrAWvTksk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tokyo Wars is coming to modern consoles as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives and Arcade Archives 2 collections. The game lets players control a tank or a team of tanks as they face off against a rival team in Tokyo's downtown district or the city's bayside dock. In the arcades, up to eight players could take part in Tokyo Wars' head-to-head battles if four two-player cabinets were linked together. The cabinets also featured an air-powered recoil that simulated the sensation of tank fire.</p><p>It's important to note that the Arcade Archives version for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch don't have as many options as the Arcade Archives 2 version on other consoles. In the former, players will get the original arcade game, a high-score mode, and a caravan mode that gives players 10-minutes to come out on top. Each of those modes will support online rankings.</p><p>However, only the Arcade Archive 2 versions on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Switch 2 will offer split-screen multiplayer, a time attack mode, and VRR support. Tokyo Wars' Arcade Archive 1 and 2 versions are both available now on their consoles' respective digital storefronts.</p><p>If you're looking for a quieter arcade experience, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/golden-tee-arcade-classics/" data-ref-id="5000-682677">Golden Tee Arcade Classics collection</a> was released earlier this year. But if you want to play the action-packed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> arcade game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-its-own-arcade-game/1100-6530277/" data-ref-id="1100-6530277">Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars</a>, you'll have to find a Dave &amp; Buster's or another modern arcade.</p>
