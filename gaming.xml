In what's becoming something of a trend, another major game company became embroiled in legal proceedings—but this week it was Tencent's turn to feel the wrath of the merciless court filing after Sony took the conglomerate to task for allegedly producing a "slavish" Horizon clone.

The company claimed Tencent's upcoming survival adventure, Light of Motiram, is a "blatant" and "unlawful" copy of its own sci-fi series. Tencent describes the game as taking place in a "world overrun by colossal machines" on its Steam store page. Sound familiar? Sony wants a court to prevent Tencent from marketing and distributing the title, and in a wild twist even alleges that Tencent sought to license the Horizon IP in 2024 before revealing Light of Motiram a few months later. Get the popcorn in.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="EA CEO claims EA Sports will become the 'most valuable sports business in the world'"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-claims-ea-sports-will-become-the-most-valuable-sports-business-in-the-world-">EA CEO claims EA Sports will become the 'most valuable sports business in the world'</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">It's in the game—or at least, it used to be. EA boss Andrew Wilson claims EA Sports will transcend its humble origins as a mere video game studio to become the "'most valuable sports business in the world." He made the rather zealous proclamation during the company's latest earnings call, and suggested the burgeoning division will continue to explore ways to engage and integrate with real-world sports teams and their fans to cultivate "deeply immersive, socially driven experiences."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turkey-based-mobile-dev-good-job-games-raises-60m-series-a-round" target="_self" data-discover="true">Turkey-based mobile dev Good Job Games raises $60M Series A round</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-reality-labs-is-still-losing-billions">Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Meta's freewheeling metaverse division, Reality Labs, continues to use cash as kindling. The business lost $4.5 billion during the second quarter of the current fiscal year, with Meta attributing those losses (jn part) to declining Quest headset sales. Reality Labs was wrestled into being to fulfil Meta's grandiose metaverse ambitions, but has now lost over $56 billion since 2022.

During a recent earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company was "the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation" during the last quarter thanks to the successful launches Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. He also confirmed the company has 40 titles in development across its studios, which recently suffered another round of layoffs at the hands of the U.S. company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/battlefield-6-s-ugc-mode-is-the-heart-of-ea-s-live-service-aspirations-for-the-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Battlefield 6's Godot-powered UGC mode is the heart of EA's big live service swing for the series</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-are-not-losing-money-they-re-gaining-less-aheartfulofgames-accuses-parent-company-outright-games-of-mismanagement-ahead-of-purported-closure">'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Madrid-based studio Aheartfulofgames came out swinging this week and accused its parent company Outright Games of mismanagement and neglect after being marked for closure.

They also allege that Outright outsourced work that could have been handled internally to justify the closure. "They have made it clear this isn't an economic decision, but the economic context provides them an explanation for what they are doing—but they are not losing money, they're gaining less," said one source.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pokémon TCG Pocket will change card art after plagiarism accusations"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/715823/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia-tracing-lanjiujiu">Pokémon TCG Pocket will change card art after plagiarism accusations</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via The Verge // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The Pokemon Company made the rather unprecedented move of yanking two rare (digital) trading cards out of players' hands this week after Chinese artist lanjiujiu pointed out they appeared to incorporate traced versions of their original fan artwork. Pokemon TCG Pocket's immersive Ho-Oh card (from the new Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion) featured an image of the legendary bird that was almost identical to one created by lanjiujiu. Although The Pokemon Company has a legal right to use fan artwork, the company replaced the Ho-oh EX card and its Lugia EX counterpart with placeholders and said its production team had provided "incorrect reference materials" as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to produce the artwork.

It turns out, however, that a group called Collective Short, which professes to fight "sexploitation" was at least partially to blame for the wave of censorship that washed across the game industry almost overnight.

<p>Switch 2 launched on 5th June and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">today's Q1 financial report</a> includes figures up to the end of that month. The stated figure of "more than 6 million" accounts for sales past that date, though, to approximately 24th July (seven weeks post-launch).</p>
<p>As of 30th June, Nintendo had sold 5.82 million Switch 2s (3.5 million <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">in the first four days</a>) along with 5.63 million copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, including the digital downloads included in the popular Mario Kart hardware bundle. Overall Switch 2 software sales totalled 8.67 million units.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original Switch managed to shift 0.98 million units in the same period, down from 2.1 million in the same quarter last year (-53.5%), bringing it to a lifetime total of 153.10 million units so far. Switch 1 software sales came in at 24.4 million, down from 30.64 million in Q1 last year (-20.4%).</p>
<p>Here's the regional breakdown for Switch 2 hardware sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan: 1.27 million</li>
<li>The Americas: 2.08 million</li>
<li>Europe: 1.34 million</li>
<li>Other: 1.13 million</li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33cb7f24bec8/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched to critical acclaim, but isn't included in today's results (it launched in July) — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you'd expect following a successful console launch, gross profit increased 21.4% year-on-year (to 185.1 billion yen), although the lower profit made on the newer hardware meant profit margins declined 29.5 points to 32.3%.</p>
<p>Nintendo's forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 units this financial year remains unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">its May forecasts</a>. The company expects to sell 45 million software units in the same period.</p>
<p>The report states that demand for the new system is exceeding supply "in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers."</p>
<hr>
<p><em>tl;dr: Switch 2 sold like hotcakes, Mario Kart World has a crazy-good attach rate (as you'd expect), and Nintendo's new generation is off to a very solid, record-breaking start.</em></p>

<p>Of course, at this time, we don't know if there will be any support for ray tracing effects, although it would be weird if not. After all, Battlefield V was <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-bfv-nvidia-rtx/">one of the very first games to support NVIDIA RTX</a>, specifically for reflections. The support of PC upscalers like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel is practically a guarantee, though.</p>

                                        <p>When I was growing up, E3 was one of the events in the calendar that I looked forward to the most. From console reveals to star-studded conferences, the Electronic Entertainment Expo was a series of corporate conferences that somehow felt like The Oscars, Comic-Con and Glastonbury combined. It was there that Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last Guardian were finally shown (at the same conference); where then Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé made his public debut; and the venue where Keanu Reeves told a packed LA auditorium that they were all breathtaking. Yet for all its show-stopping game and console reveals, after 2020, it was the show itself that stopped, with the last in-person E3 taking place in 2019.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg"></figure><p>Luckily for mourning gamers, there was always another world-leading interactive entertainment show that connected fans and industry folk with demos, head-turning announcements and best-in-class community events: Germany's gamescom. Where E3 was an event that was media-only for most of its existence, gamescom was always--and very much continues to be--a public-facing celebration of games and gamers; a convention that is just as brilliant for inspiring world-beating cosplay as it is for connecting journalists with publishers and industry folks in the business area. E3 may be gone, but gamescom is still here, having established itself as the world's biggest and best gaming event.</p><p>Since 2019, gamescom has begun hosting its own games announcements, with the annual Geoff Keighley-hosted gamescom Opening Night Live gaining a reputation for delivering a non-stop cavalcade of exciting reveals. With gamescom's annual August celebration now comfortably the largest gaming event in the world--and with new gamescom sister events now delighting gamers in Brazil and Singapore (gamescom Asia is moving to Thailand for its next event)--it feels like the right time to celebrate the legacy of gaming's most beloved event. So, without further ado, here's a history of how Cologne's once humble convention went on to change the game forever.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Origins</h2><p>Starting life in 2009, gamescom immediately attracted the attention of the biggest publishers in the games industry, alongside 228,000 excitable punters. With 450 exhibitors showing up in its first year, the inaugural gamescom also saw Sony announce the PlayStation 3 Slim, alongside Microsoft revealing Fable 3 for the first time. Since then, gamescom has only gone from strength to strength, attracting more players, developers and publishers with each new year that goes by.</p><p>Esports became a cornerstone of the Cologne convention. In 2011, gamescom hosted the first-ever DOTA 2 international tournament to great success, leading to massive Starcraft 2, League of Legends, and Counter Strike competitions being held at gamescom in the following years. By 2017, gamescom had attracted over 100,000 more visitors, with 355,000 people attending the event, and gamescom's doors were opened by none other than Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p><p>Alongside these public-facing demos and reveals, from 2009-2016, gamescom also hosted a sister developer-focused event, a European spin-off of San Francisco’s legendary Game Developer Conference.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Revelations</h2><p>In 2018, gamescom had over 1000 exhibitors showcasing at their event. Nvidia made headlines that year by revealing their GeForce RTX 20 Series at the event, with 370,000 gamers, developers, journalists and publishers all making the pilgrimage to Cologne to see the best games in the world. Thankfully, 2018 was also the last year that only those on the ground could share in the fun. Ten years after gamescom first opened its doors, in 2019, gamescom kicked off its first-ever livestreamed event--gamescom ONL. Hosted by The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley, gamescom ONL immediately cemented itself as a marquee, industry-shaping showcase, with new looks at Gears of War 5, Call of Duty, and Death Stranding alongside announcements of titles like Little Nightmares 2. With 1,500 people watching live in the auditorium and over 500,000 people tuning in online, gamescom ONL was a huge success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg"></figure><p>As the pandemic hurriedly cancelled events and public gatherings across the world, gamescom took the entire show online, its 2020 edition delivering a jam-packed schedule of online developer interviews and new looks at games alongside its second gamescom Opening Night Live. It was also the first time gamescom published content specifically for independent gaming with gamescom awesome indies. The show provided recognition for the hardworking, creative indie developers who produce some of the most unique games in the industry, and also provided tantalising teasers for gamers who appreciate the indie scene.</p><h2>gamescom Evolution</h2><p>As the world reopened after the pandemic, so did gamescom, with 2022's edition offering gamers a canny mix of online and in-person events. Since then, gamescom has only become more vital for the games industry--the beating heart of in-person game feedback, world-exclusive demos, and dream-fulfilling game reveals. Over the years, gamescom's cultural and political influence has continued to grow, with Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel's visit in 2017 followed by German ministers like Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck in 2023 and 2024. Federal Minister for Research, Dorothee Bär--the representative responsible for games in the new German government--has also attended. European games associations such as Video Games Europe and EGDF also regularly take advantage of gamescom, using it as a place to invite political leaders to the event, with 2024's gamescom hosting over 500 political guests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg"></figure><p>Yet it’s not just the in-person extravaganza that has blossomed. In its five short years of existence, gamescom Opening Night Live has only gone from strength to strength, establishing itself as a key event in gaming culture’s calendar. Gamescom ONL has been chosen as the place to reveal Borderlands 4, Dead Island 2, Dune Awakening, and many others, with 2024’s edition seeing 44 million viewers watching the show's content globally.</p><p>Last year, gamescom tripled its opening exhibitor number, hosting 1,462 exhibitors, with even more exhibitors and visitors expected in 2025. With the inaugural years of gamescom asia X Thailand Game Show and gamescom latam already attracting huge industry attention, gamescom looks set to continue its reputation for hosting the biggest and best events in video games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540189"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg"></figure><p>There's <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/tickets/buy-tickets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still time to pick up tickets for gamescom 2025</a>, which runs from August 20th to August 24th.

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be able to choose between Quality and Performance visual modes when the game launches in a week's time.</p>
<p>Those who prefer a higher resolution should plump for Quality Mode, while those who would rather prioritise framerate should go for Performance Mode. <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1951012716409397433">The studio</a> said Mafia: The Old Country will run at an "average" of 60fps when played in Performance Mode. The studio's statement does not include Xbox Series S, which will presumably run at a lower framerate.</p>
<p>In addition, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has confirmed the PC requirements from Minimum (suitable for older hardware) to Epic ("If you've got a powerful-enough PC, these Epic specs will give you the absolute best visual fidelity for Mafia: The Old Country's rendition of 1900s Sicily").</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> team has asked its community to stop directly blaming or criticising the artist who created cards for its mobile trading game using "incorrect reference materials", which turned out to be unofficial fan art.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it came to light that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">fan artwork had been inadvertently used as a reference to create cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket's Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>. At this time, the developer acknowledged it had "provided incorrect reference materials as official documents" to the artist who was commissioned to create the cards in question. However, it never explicitly stated how the materials were provided, and in the time since many were still directing the blame towards the illustrator themself for copying the fan art.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket's publisher The Pokémon Company together with developer Creatures Inc have issued a new statement, affirming the blame does not lie with the illustrator but with them.</p>
<p>"Regarding the previously announced issue with the Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lugia EX (3-star) illustrations – it has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the statement, which was shared via the official Japanese X account of Pokémon TCG Pocket, reads (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-claims-full-responsibility-for-tcg-pocket-card-plagiarism-issue-asks-fans-not-to-criticize-artist/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p>
<p>The companies explained there are two workflows when it comes to creating cards for Pokémon TCG Pocket - either illustrators have creative control over the card designs, which is the most common practice, or the game's production team create a 'blueprint' of what it requires for a card. A commissioned illustrator then tweaks and finalises the concept before it is added into the game, and it would appear that this is what happened with the production of the since-removed Ho-oh and Lugia cards.</p> <div>

<p>The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc have asked the community to stop blaming and criticising the illustrator for what they admit is their error, and said they will enforce stricter measures going forward, to ensure this kind of mix up does not happen again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the affected cards have been replaced with placeholders cards which read "New Artwork Coming Soon" in lieu of a creature (see below).</p>

			<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financials</a> just delivered an update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 sales</a>. According to the Big N, the hardware has now exceeded a sell-through of six million units in the seven weeks after launch. By the end of the quarter that ended in June, the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold 5.82 million units. Software sales for the platform have reached 8.67 million units in total, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> unsurprisingly taking up the lion's share (5.63 million units, nearly one per Switch 2 buyer).</p>



<p>Nintendo recognized the existing supply issue:</p>



<p><em>Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers. We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible.</em></p>



<p>The previous conservative forecast of 15 million Switch 2 units and 45 million software units sold in fiscal year 2026 remains unchanged. </p>



<p>Net sales predictably boomed in this first quarter compared to last year, from 246.6 billion yen ($1.6 billion) to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), marking a 132.1% increase. However, the IP related business decreased slightly this quarter (from 17.5 billion yen to 16.7 billion yen, a 4.4% downgrade) due to decreased revenue related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry, and it now sounds like the developer wasn't exactly thrilled about that.</p>
<p>Ryan portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which came out in 2013. It soon became a series favourite for many, and in recent times rumours of a remake have been making the rounds.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>These rumours were amplified again in June, when Ryan hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real.</p>
<p>"Have you beaten [Black Flag]?" Ryan asked a fan in a clip that was shared around social media (see below). The fan confirmed they had but some time ago, to which Ryan followed up with: "Well, you might have to beat it again…"</p>
<p>When the fan suggested maybe playing through all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, Ryan replied: "Well, especially this one… There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction. It looks like he hinted at the Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake. 🔥</p><p>🟢 Quote:<br>“Have you beat the game?… well you may have to beat it again”<br>And <br>“There’s a reason I say that but I can’t say… <a href="https://t.co/n3PwF8Q7Ri">pic.twitter.com/n3PwF8Q7Ri</a></p></div>— Zephryss⛩️ (@TheRealZephryss) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealZephryss/status/1939392046151926243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and it turns out not only was Ubisoft unhappy that Ryan had been a little loose-lipped, but the company actually also threatened him with legal action.</p>
<p>At another more recent convention, the Edward Kenway actor was asked about a Black Flag remake or remaster, to which he replied with a casual shrug and a "I don't know, mate". The questioner then pressed Ryan further, calling back to the previous video from June, when the actor then explained:</p>
<p>"Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [gestures towards the person filming the exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone.</p>
<p>"And then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing." A video of the exchange was uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> but has since been removed. A copy is embedded below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment on Ryan's Black Flag-flavoured exchanges, and will update you if we hear anything more.</p>
<p>Word of a Black Flag remake first began circulating in 2023, when it was said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved". Of course, Skull and Bones - which sadly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">failed to really get any decent wind in its sails following its launch last year</a> - began life as a spin-off from Black Flag.</p>
<p>At the time of this initial rumour, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">project was not expected to be completed for "at least a few years"</a>, though given we are now marching firmly into the latter half of 2025, a 'few years' is actually coming up <em>relatively </em>soon now. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 & PlayStation Handheld Specs Leaked – Rasterization Performance Estimated to be 3X and 0.5X of PS5, Respectively]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-%E2%80%93-rasterization-performance-estimated-to-be-3x-and-0-5x-of-ps5-respectively.1259334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Monday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> on the PlayStation 6 and PlayStation handheld codenames (Orion and Canis), YouTube Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tym6xxCKvHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> specs for both upcoming consoles from a leaked 2023 AMD presentation.</p>



<p>According to the leaks, Sony is going for a relatively conservative system. Its main goal will be keeping power lower than a base PlayStation 5, with the target being 160W TBP. The console will employ a chiplet design, with 8 Zen 6 cores and between 40 and 48 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked at over 3GHz.</p>



<p>These are fewer Compute Units than the 60 available for the PlayStation 5 Pro, but they will run much faster. Moreover, RDNA 5 is expected to bring a noticeable improvement in IPC performance, so each Compute Unit will deliver more performance than the CUs in the PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>The memory also has a lower bus than the PS5 Pro (160 or 192 bit compared to the PS5 Pro's 256 bit), but it will be powered by the much faster GDDR7, allowing it to reach clocks of 32Gbps for an estimated bandwidth of 640GB/s-768GB/s, depending on the final bus spec. That's higher than the PS5 Pro's bandwidth of 576GB/s.</p>



<p>Overall, the estimation is that rasterization performance will be over three times that of the base PlayStation 5 and around double that of the newer PlayStation 5 Pro. That would place the performance level of the PlayStation 6 roughly around a GeForce RTX 4080, although of course, it's never quite an apples-to-apples comparison when measuring consoles and PC GPUs directly. The uplift of ray tracing performance should be much higher (6-10x), thanks to the expected advancements AMD will bring in the area. </p>



<p>Backward compatibility is expected to be maintained for PS5 and PS4. The production phase should begin in mid-2027, with an estimated release in stores in late 2027 or early 2028 for a price of around $499.</p>



<p>As for the Project Canis handheld, it should use a monolithic 3nm die equipped with 4 Zen 6C cores. The GPU is expected to have between 12 and 20 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked between 1.6 and 2.2GHz. The memory will equip a 128-bit bus with LPDDR5X 7500 RAM. Sony is reportedly targeting a 15-watt thermal board power.</p>



<p>Rasterization performance should be around half that of the base PlayStation 5, but thanks to the advancements brought by the RDNA 5 architecture, the uplift of ray tracing performance should be higher. The handheld should also feature backward compatibility with PS4 and PS5, microSD and M.2 SSD storage support, haptic feedback, dual microphones, a touchscreen, and a USB-C port supporting fast charging and video output.</p>



<p>Overall, it should easily outperform the Xbox Ally X. However, that's not saying much since that handheld is launching soon, and the PlayStation handheld is instead targeting a similar launch window to its bigger sibling, the PlayStation 6. Pricing estimates put it around $400 or $500.</p>



<p>Moore's Law Is Dead also briefly touched upon the next-generation Xbox console, whose codename is Magnus. It should be equipped with 11 Zen 6 cores and 68 Compute Units, proving to be more powerful than the PS5 Pro but not quite a match for the PlayStation 6. However, it should launch sooner than that, which resonates with <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a> that Microsoft might be looking to try a repeat of the Xbox 360 situation, which debuted one year before the PlayStation 3 and was Xbox's most successful console to date. Still, the YouTuber says the new Xbox console won't be available before 2027.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the specs came from an old presentation. Therefore, specific details might have changed since. We won't know the official specs until well into 2026, at the very least. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-%E2%80%93-we-played-it-for-5-hours.1259331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who loved Bloober Team’s 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2, I’m happy to report that while being made by an entirely different developer, Silent Hill f boasts that same level of quality and polish. From story to worldbuilding, from graphics to combat and exploration, Taiwan-based developer Neobards has crafted an experience that meets the high bar set by the Polish developer, albeit in a drastically different setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I started walking the dense yet deserted streets of Ebisugaoka, it was immediately apparent just how detailed and well-realized this fictional remote town in the mountains of rural Japan in the Sixties is. With an immersive over-the-shoulder view and no UI on screen during exploration, Silent Hill f is a game that tells a convincing story through its visuals.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, I was initially skeptical of Konami’s decision to entrust a non-Japanese developer to create a game set in Japan, but five hours of actually playing Silent Hill f shattered such prejudices. Ebisugaoka is undoubtedly one of the most impressive contemporary Japanese townscapes I have ever seen in a video game, and that comes from someone who has lived in Japan for the majority of his life and loves games like Shenmue, Persona, and Ghostwire: Tokyo.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Exploring a Japanese mountain village</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the few minor issues I had with the Silent Hill 2 remake was that the majority of its playtime is spent inside buildings and facilities. While these functioned as well-designed dungeons packed with horrifying enemies to fight and intricate puzzles to solve, the increase in volume compared to the 2001 original made it feel like exploration of the actual town of Silent Hill was limited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the vast majority of my playtime with Silent Hill f was spent exploring Ebisugaoka. Old wooden houses with tin roofs line the narrow alleys, scattered with bicycles, flower pots, and mailboxes. Small streams and footpaths between rice fields gently lead the way to the village. Fences along the river and concrete stairways following the slopes create a townscape that oozes with atmosphere. Files and other documents scattered throughout the town add context to Ebisugaoka, which flourished as a mining town during its heyday. Now, it has become a largely forgotten village and its people are stuck in old ways, such as favoring traditional healthcare methods over modern medical science and being overly devout to the Shinto deity Inari. The context of Ebisugaoka and its people immediately feel like they are an integral part of Silent Hill f’s cohesive story, which made me eager to go off the beaten path and obtain every hidden file.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story starts after protagonist Hinako – a female high school student – runs away from home after being scolded by her drunk father. Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it doesn’t take long until Hinako and her friends discover something is wrong in town, and before you know it Hinako is holding an iron pipe in her hands, an iconic weapon of the series. Ebisugaoka then gradually proves to not just be suited for a captivating walking simulator experience, but also the perfect setting for a horror game, as its narrow alleys and staircases are ideal to hide enemies behind corners while also functioning as a maze for the player to get lost in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some instances, doors left ajar and open windows invite Hinako inside traditional tatami-floored houses, where she will have to solve some simple puzzles in order to make her way through to the next area. These puzzles play out in an unconventional way. One puzzle, for example, had me obtain keys to a locked door, but there was nothing noteworthy inside. Then, as I went back to the corridor another door suddenly swung open, which gave me the chills.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Something feels off</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s scenario writer Ryukishi07 sees Japanese horror as a sub-genre that doesn’t so much rely on threats to the protagonist's life, but rather makes you feel uncomfortable by creating situations that feel off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you think about it, Silent Hill is a series known for just that. While there isn’t a lack of life-threatening encounters, some of the series’ most uncomfortable moments are in conversations with its outright weird characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Silent Hill f, Hinako and her friends are trying to find a way to escape the haunted town of Ebisugaoka. Interactions with these friends seem normal at first, but then suddenly they say or do something that catches you off guard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, in typical Silent Hill fashion, puzzles often reveal something about Hinako or the world she inhabits. A puzzle on a misty rice field has you examine scarecrows in order to learn the direction you should be heading, which is connected to a childhood trauma of Hinako getting lost and being afraid of the scarecrows.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During my playthrough, puzzles never felt too difficult. Hints provided by files you obtain never make the solution too obvious, while still giving the player an idea of what they have to do. On a related note, Silent Hill f has difficulty settings for both its combat and puzzles, and while Konami advised me to play on Story mode for both, I stubbornly chose Normal mode as I wanted to take on a challenge. While the difficulty of the puzzles never overwhelmed me, combat proved to be a bit more demanding. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon durability at its best</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. Hinako can obtain all sorts of weapons ranging from iron pipes to kitchen knives and baseball bats, but no guns come into play. With some exceptions, these weapons are not obtained through story beats, but are scattered throughout Silent Hill f’s world like other resources, and Hinako can carry up to three weapons at a time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you wield iron pipes and stab at enemies with knives, you will notice that the game has weapon durability. It is a nice touch that weapons that are about to break actually change in appearance, so expect to be holding a bent pipe or a broken bat. This also functions as a hint to the player, which Hinako will acknowledge by mentioning that she should fix it. Weapons can be fixed by using a repair kit, but these are so scarce that on many occasions you will have to say goodbye to your new favorite weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While weapon durability is often regarded as a burden in games, it works here as finding a new weapon and repair kits quickly becomes an integral part of the resource management that the survival horror genre is known for, especially since you won’t be having to look for ammo this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clever system allows you to turn in your resources for an in-game currency at save points, which can be used to increase your stats or obtain new amulets that can be equipped to give you certain buffs. That means that if you are careful and don’t waste your resources, leftovers can be turned into something useful, which feels like a great reward to a well-planned expedition. Hinako can only carry a limited amount of items, which also seems to stimulate active use of this new trading system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Silent Hill 2 remake, resources were so abundant that skilled players didn’t really have to worry about resource management, to the extent that they would have a large stock of unused ammo and items by the end of the game. Silent Hill f solves this problem by making resources tradable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Silent Souls?</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself has a similar feel to Silent Hill 2’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button, while you can activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks especially are slow and need to be timed well, contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, each weapon type has a completely unique set of motions and reach. Swinging a newly obtained baseball bat at an enemy or charging at them with a knife you found in the kitchen of a local residence always creates new and exciting situations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks. The latter in particular deals lots of damage and is key in battle. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you will likely have a hard time reacting. That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. When in Focus mode, enemy signs for counterattacks appear for longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. That means you might head into Focus Mode with the intention of going for a counterattack, but find yourself switching to a power attack when it charges before the enemy shows an opening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus Mode is tied to Hinako’s mental energy gauge, which exists separately from her stamina and health bar. Interestingly, the upper limit of her mental energy decreases when enemies do something that scares her or when she is frightened by a certain event, connecting the gameplay to the story and Hinako’s mental state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are items that can recover the upper limit of your mental energy gauge, but Hinako’s stamina is limited too. When she runs out of stamina and mental energy, she can become so frightened and tired that she won’t even be able to move for a while. Managing her energy resources, therefore, is key to survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fighting one regular enemy is fairly manageable, but when confronted by multiple enemies, running away often felt like the best option, especially since enemies don’t give experience points or drop resources. Combat was fun enough that I found myself actively engaging in fights even if there wasn’t a real benefit to it beyond being able to explore the environment more freely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While keeping combat engaging and complex, Silent Hill f does a great job in making the player feel weak. The design cleverly incorporates this by having what seems to be a boss battle at first actually play out as a sequence in which the player has to find an escape route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another iconic element to the series is the existence of an alternate world, which is present in Silent Hill f as well. Hinako is occasionally transported to a different dimension that shows a more traditional Japan, where a mysterious masked figure guides her through the grounds of various shrines. Here, Hinako obtains traditional Japanese weapons such as the Naginata, a pole weapon with a curved blade on the end, similar to a glaive or halberd that is known to be mostly used by women. Weapons that Hinako finds in this alternate world don’t break, but Hinako won’t be able to carry them over to Ebisugaoka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was in this realm that I encountered the main boss of my playtime, which proved much more difficult than I had anticipated. Even with my full understanding of the combat mechanics and systems, its long reach, hard-to-predict attack patterns, and multiple stages required significant trial and error. The boss took me nearly an hour to beat, but gradually learning how to take on the boss was a welcome challenge that never felt unfair. For reference, my colleague was playing on Story Mode and defeated the boss on his second try, but an acquaintance from another media outlet who was also playing on Story Mode didn’t manage to defeat the boss and ran out of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he didn’t specifically mention the Soulslike genre, series producer Motoi Okamoto says that Silent Hill f’s combat was inspired by the current popularity of more difficult action games. With multiple difficulty settings, Silent Hill f is by no means a Soulslike, but its boss design shares a similar learning curve that ultimately results in a great feeling of satisfaction when you finally beat it. Silent Hill f is a story-driven experience above anything else, but it just happens to have really solid combat mechanics and systems at the same time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One unique component of Silent Hill f’s storytelling is the notebook Hinako carries. Here you can read about characters, locations, and events that appear in the story, all written from Hinako’s perspective. At first, it seems to be a pretty straightforward archive, but events in the story can trigger additional text for previously unlocked entries. Instead of simply repeating what events in the story already told you, these additional texts go much deeper into the lore and background. Sometimes, they can slightly contradict or change your view on characters and events, indicating that things are never what they seem to be on the surface. It is not hard to imagine that for a deeper understanding of Silent Hill f’s story and characters, examining these texts will be essential.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Back to school</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The last part of my demo took place inside a school, which was essentially a dungeon similar to Silent Hill 2’s aforementioned apartment buildings, hospitals, museums and hotels. Upon entering the school, Hinako obtains a map of the building which the player will have to use to navigate their way through. Luckily, Hinako is just as diligent a note-taking enthusiast as Silent Hill 2’s James, so whenever you learn that a door is locked or that there is a passage somewhere, it will be noted on the map. Inside the school, I had to solve a multitude of puzzles in order to find keys to reach different classrooms and floors while fighting and running away from enemies along the way. Just like the town itself, the old wooden school building oozes with atmosphere and feels lively even though none of its students or teachers are there, and Hinako's remark to herself, “I haven't been here since graduation,” subtly added to the atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While in recent video games, the abundance of self-talk by the protagonist can sometimes feel a bit too much, Hinako’s occasional monologue succeeds in subtly contributing to the situation without ever coming over as an exposition dump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Okamoto, the average playtime for Silent Hill f will be about 12 or 13 hours, which should indicate that I have played through roughly one third of the game. While I don’t know how things will go from here, so far the game’s balance between town exploration and interior facilities feels like an improvement over the Silent Hill 2 remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, while the first five hours of the game felt like they were structured linearly, Silent Hill f has multiple endings like many other games in the series, including the famous UFO ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Silent Hill f was promising to say the least. Its worldbuilding and story had me so intrigued that I still think back on my brief visit to Ebisugaoka almost a week later. The deep fog that envelops the town somehow feels more natural than in the town of Silent Hill, perhaps due to the fact that Ebisugaoka is a mountain village. Ebisugaoka just feels like the perfect fit for a psychological horror narrative, and all of Silent Hill f’s systems and mechanics complement the setting. Series composer Akira Yamaoka’s soundtrack also does a stellar job in making the player feel uncomfortable throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Silent Hill f seems to be a horror game that gets everything right. If, like me, the Silent Hill 2 remake was one of your favorite games of 2024, Silent Hill f has the potential to become a serious game of the year contender when it releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Silent Hill 2 f ©Konami Digital Entertainment</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*In-development footage and screenshots are shown.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours]]></content:encoded>

<p>New listing says it's a "game on cart"</p>

<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd8dd6dd346c/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new wave of Game-Key Card titles have just been announced for the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">following Nintendo's Partner Showcase</a>. Although it seems this type of release won't be stopping any time soon, not every third-party title is necessarily taking this route.</p>
<p>According to a new listing, Digital Eclipse – which has made a name for itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/atari-50-game-list-every-playable-game-in-the-anniversary-celebration-expanded-edition">reviving various retro game libraries</a> – will be offering the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on a full game cartridge. This information was shared via the Canadian-based physical game seller and website, Video Games Plus.</p>
<p>The social page makes a special note about how the Nintendo Switch 2 release is on the card. The website also lists a deluxe edition of this physical release for $114.99 CAD, which will apparently contain a "steelbook and other exclusive items" that haven't been revealed just yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Video Games Plus: "Preorders are now live on Day 1 &amp; Deluxe Editions of Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Nintendo Switch, PS5, and NSW2 (Game on Cart)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pre-orders for the standard edition (priced at $79.99 CAD) and deluxe edition of this Legacy Kollection are now live on the same website, but there's no mention on these particular pages about the product being a "game on cart" release, so you might want to hold off until there's a more official confirmation.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of third-party Switch 2 titles have shipped with the entire game on the game card. One of these was CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, with the company even acknowledging the importance of physical media, and to not "underestimate the physical edition" of games.</p>

<p>Have you played the demo yet?</p>

<p>To send off Nintendo's recent Partner Showcase, Square Enix announced some new projects, and one of them happened to be the brand new HD-2D title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>.</p>
<p>This is an action RPG where the combat will take place in real-time instead of the usual turn-based battles you might be used to in certain other titles. It's also developed by Team Asano (the developers behind series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default</a>).</p>
<p>In case you missed it, a demo is now available on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms, and Square Enix has issued a reminder about this along with some information about what to expect if you haven't already played it:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ymqtun&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8393249/AoE-Demo-Survery-2025">survey where you can share your thoughts</a> about what you've experienced so far, which the developer will use to "help make the final game even better". It includes questions like why you decided to play the game, how you found out about it, the difficulty you played on, and there are also some written responses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-leapmove-is-a-gamified-camera-designed-to-get-kids-off-the-couch.1259286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>LeapFrog has announced a new electronic learning system that swaps controllers for a camera. In fact, the LeapMove looks like an oversized, kid-friendly webcam, but is designed to connect to TVs like a console and get kids off the couch using educational games that require full-body movements to play. It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting">Xbox Kinect</a> or the PlayStation 2’s EyeToy, but simpler and much cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/705269/nex-playground-kid-friendly-gaming-console-amazon-prime-day-deal">competitors’ products</a> like the $249 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nex Playground</a>.</p><p>The LeapMove will be available through retailers including Target, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMAGIC-CAM%2F14840114967%3F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and Amazon for $69.99, and comes with 25 motion-based games designed for kids aged 4 to 7. It might be hard to pull the older end of that demographic away from games like Roblox, <em>Among Us</em>, and even <em>Fortnite</em>, but in addition to motion detection, the LeapMove uses its camera to make players appear as themselves or “whimsical characters” in several games, which may appeal to younger kids.</p><p>The games cover “foundational school subjects” including math, reading, and spelling, and require players to do everything from dancing around to waving their arms and even attempting to catch on-screen objects. The LeapMove connects to a TV over HDMI, and instead of rechargeable batteries it needs access to a power outlet. It can be used either sitting beneath a TV or perched atop it like a webcam using a fold-out support.</p><p>LeapFrog says additional games will be made available for the LeapMove at a later date, which can be loaded by connecting the device to a computer and using the company’s <a href="https://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/support/connect">LeapFrog Connect</a> desktop app. They won’t be free, but unlike the Nex Playground, the LeapMove doesn’t come with any subscription fees.</p><p>Parents concerned about privacy, particularly with devices that rely heavily on a camera, may appreciate that the LeapMove has no wireless connectivity. In 2018, VTech, LeapFrog’s parent company, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/8/16865652/vtech-connected-toy-ftc-fine-child-privacy">agreed to settle for a $650,000 fine</a> after the FTC alleged it collected kids’ personal information, including names, emails, and genders, through its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.vtech.mobile.kidiconnect.useng" rel="sponsored">KidiConnect mobile app</a>. The LeapMove is completely standalone and keeps track of up to three players’ progress locally.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717018/leapfrog-leapmove-motion-detection-gaming]]></content:encoded>

<p>Switch update confirmed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco officially lifted the lid on Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> in this week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>
<p>This game will be coming to Nintendo's platforms later this year on <strong>14th November 2025</strong> and pre-orders are available now. It follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">a rating for this platform earlier this year</a> in Saudi Arabia. This latest game is powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's also mentioned in the PR how these versions of the game will come with local multiplayer and motion controls.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the video above, there will also be an update for the Switch physical and digital versions of this game, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>

The game is available for preorder now in several editions. Read on for details about what comes in each one, how much they cost, where you can preorder, and more.</p><p id="standard-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Standard edition">Preorder Octopath Traveler 0</h2></p><p id="deluxe-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deluxe edition">Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/deluxe-1753988720266.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbGVx?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it for PS4 or PS5</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb2ml?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it for Xbox</a> - $59.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital deluxe edition comes with the game itself, plus the following digital items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Digital art book</li><li>Deluxe Travel Provisions:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Action Skills<ul data-cy="list"><li>Triple Strike Mastery, SP Saver Mastery, Extra JP Mastery</li></ul></li><li>Consumable Items: 8 Types of Nuts<ul data-cy="list"><li>Fortifying Nut, Magic Nut, Tough Nut, Resistant Nut, Light Nut, Critical Nut, Sharp Nut, Slippery Nut</li></ul></li><li>Town Decorations: Festive Decoration Designs<ul data-cy="list"><li>Table with Roasted Chicken, Festive Arch, Large Festive Arch, Festive Flag, Grand Vase</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p id="collectors-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Collector's edition">Octopath Traveler 0 Collector’s Edition</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/collectors-edition-1753988733012.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgw6N?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Square Enix Store</a> - $229.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This Square Enix Store-exclusive edition comes with the game itself, plus the following extras:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade Code</li><li>Ring of the Flamebringer (JP ring size 21)</li><li>Traveler's Playing Cards</li><li>8-Sided Dice of Wealth, Power, and Fame</li><li>Orsterra Continent Map Gaming Mat </li><li>Arrangements Break &amp; Boost Vol.3 (Music CD)</li><li>Art booklet</li></ul><p id="preorder-bonus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder bonus">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Bonus</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/preorder-1753988759998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorder Octopath Traveler 0, and you’ll receive a set of in-game items called Travel Provisions, which Square Enix describes as “A set of items and skills useful for the start of your journey.”</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Healing Grape (M) x5</li><li>Inspiriting Plum (M) x5</li><li>Revitalizing Jam x2</li><li>Icewind Mastery</li></ul><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Octopath Traveler 0?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-announces-octopath-traveler-0-for-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2">Octopath Traveler 0</a> starts with you creating your own character from scratch.

But later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6</a> will take things even further with an overhauled map-creation toolset for the upcoming shooter. Now, DICE and EA have shared a video that offers a brief glimpse at the new Portal mode and what it's bringing to the table.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92CHDiFW0wA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new Portal mode allows players to build, share, and play their custom maps with more options than ever before. One of the new tools is a spatial editor powered by Godot that gives creators the chance to spatially edit maps and move around preexisting elements at will. Portal also includes custom and AI scripting that lets players create unique UI and direct NPC combatants on their battlefields. Any experience made with Portal will be available to other players through the community section.</p><p dir="ltr">Portal will also include modifiers that let players change the rules of the game. That includes the ability to set up one-shot kills, closed weapons, and many others. More intriguingly, player progression and XP gain are fully enabled during Portal mode.</p><p>EA and DICE also indicated that there will be several maps added to the game post-launch. But for now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/" data-ref-id="2900-6834">there are nine maps</a> that will be available at launch. The locations include New York, Egypt, and Gibraltar, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-battlefield-6s-new-destruction-elements-in-action-in-this-video/1100-6530977/" data-ref-id="1100-6530977">with tons of destructible elements</a>.

<p>It's scheduled to arrive in 2025</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Masahiro Sakurai's latest project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> soars onto the Switch 2 at some point later this year.</p>
<p>While we haven't heard all that much about it since the initial announcement in April, the game has reportedly been rated in Saudi Arabia recently – receiving an age rating in this location of "7 and above" (<a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/31/kirby-air-riders-for-nintendo-switch-2-has-been-rated-in-saudi-arabia/">via My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>Sakurai did provide a small update about this title earlier in July, mentioning how it was "shaping up to be something great". This also happened to be timed in with the 22nd anniversary of the original GameCube title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The classification for this title hopefully means a release isn't too far away. If this new Kirby racer does make its 2025 window, it will join other racing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo releases coming to the Switch this year include titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and the Koei Tecmo project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was featured during this week's Partner Direct.</p>

<p>The new entry arrives this October</p>

<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Switch 2 Partner Showcase</a> has just revealed what's ahead for the new hybrid platform in terms of third-party offerings, but it seems one series that won't be showing up any time soon is EA's popular military shooter Battlefield.</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke to Battlefield's head Vince Zempella as part of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI">multiplayer reveal today</a>, and it's been officially confirmed the company "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>The team is focused on delivering the game where the "core Battlefield audience is present", according to the same story.</p>
<p>EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">official FAQ for Battlefield 6</a> further confirms how the new entry, which launches on <strong>10th October 2025</strong>, will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (including the Steam, EA App, and Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>Although EA won't be delivering Battlefield 6 on the Switch 2, earlier today the third-party giant announced it would be releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants Vs Zombies: Replanted</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 this October, following a series of rumours. EA will also be bringing the latest entries in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> series to the new platform as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>This news about Battlefield follows on from Microsoft and Activision revealing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">would be released on Nintendo platforms</a> going forward.</p>

Digital preorders are also available.</p><p>While you can preorder the Octopath Traveler physical standard edition for PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch, it's worth noting that the Switch 2 physical version is yet another Game-Key Card release. That means none of the actual game data is included on the cartridge, which instead works as physical DRM that lets you download and play the digital version of the game to your Switch 2. That said, the other three platforms all include the full game data on their physical media. The Switch 2 can play Switch 1 games, so you can purchase the Switch version of Octopath Traveler 0 if you want the game on cartridge. However, Square Enix is not offering an upgrade path for the Switch 1 version--so if you want the Switch 2 version with better performance and visual fidelity, you're stuck with the Game-Key Card or digital versions of the game.</p></div>                      </div><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>$60 | Releases December 4</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4541696"></a><figcaption>Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4541696-ot0_dde_ersb-7it0u0k0v%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those who prefer digital games can also grab the $60 <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/games/octopath-traveler-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</a>, which includes everything from the base game, plus a bonus pack of helpful items and--for most consoles--a digital art book.

                <p>Earlier this year, EA showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-battlefield-6s-new-destruction-elements-in-action-in-this-video/1100-6530977/" data-ref-id="1100-6530977">some of the destructible elements</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6</a>. That glimpse of destruction you can wreak was amplified in the recently released multiplayer trailer for the game. But if you were hoping to be able to knock down every building on the map, then you may be disappointed, because the game's Tactical Destruction system will only offer so much leeway.</p><p>EA executive vice president Vince Zampella told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/battlefield-6/destruction-vince-zampella-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> that the Tactical Destruction system gives player "unparalleled levels of freedom." However, he reasons that if it was possible to completely destroy all of the buildings on the map, then the system wouldn't reflect the original intentions of the dev team.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>

<p>"We make maps very purposefully for fun, combat sight lines, and performance," said Zampella. "So if you're able to control that destruction, [it can still be] different, because you might blow up this building one time, this building another, or nothing at all. That's where the flexibility comes in. But even when they are destroyed, the map is still full. We guarantee you that the map is still fun to play. So it's about making a map and then making multiple versions of that map that are all equally balanced and fun to play."</p><p>Zampella went on to argue that too much destruction would ruin the gameplay of the map, making it less fun. He reiterated that the developers are primarily concerned with ensuring the game is fun, above all else.</p><p>EA has already revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/" data-ref-id="2900-6834">the nine Battlefield 6 maps</a> that will be available at launch.
