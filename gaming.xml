            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger have announced&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the first major story DLC for JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>. It's due to arrive sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>

<p><em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will bring a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">not that one</a>), an anthropomorphic wolfman character who looks to be a close combat melee specialist.</p>

<p>It's not just the White Wolf, though;&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will also introduce new story segments to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, as well as new areas to explore, more than 40 new enemies and bosses to take on, and more equipment to collect, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=qdSZ8wIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=4g1diigx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC will add a new playable character and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, Umami Tiger (previously known simply as solo developer Matthias Linda) hasn't revealed too much about what you can expect, which is par for the course for a story-driven RPG.</p>

<p>However, we do know&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will take place just before the finale of&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, and that it'll involve a "new call for help" being sent to the Crimson Wings. Answering that call will lead to uncovering "more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past".</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>in order to learn more. We don't have a release date for it yet, but the DLC is set to arrive sometime in Q2 next year, so you can likely expect it sometime around spring or summer.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, it's a throwback JRPG created by German solo dev Matthias Linda. The game features deliberately retro-style pixel art visuals, as well as turn-based combat and a story that revolves around multiple characters.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chained-echoes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch in Q2 next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Lego is building something new in <em>Fortnite</em>. A year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em> launched a new era inside of the game</a> — one based on the idea that <em>Fortnite</em> is a collection of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">many game experiences</a>, rather than just a battle royale — Lego is expanding its presence with a new title that sounds reminiscent of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> roleplaying as well as a rebrand of its core survival game.</p><p>First up is a game called <em>Brick Life</em>, which is billed as “an all-new social roleplay experience.” Players explore a Lego-ified city location with 31 other people and can take on specific jobs like courier, security guard, or sushi chef. Players can design their own homes and explore locations like a magical school and rooftop club, and there are missions to take on as well. From the sounds of it, <em>Brick Life</em> is a more family-friendly take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the enduring popularity of roleplaying servers in <em>GTA V</em></a>, and Epic isn’t being all that subtle about the connection:</p><p><em>Brick Life</em> is launching inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 12th, though it won’t be available for players in South Korea.</p><p>As part of the announcement, <em>Lego Fortnite</em> — the <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival experience that launched last December — is being renamed <em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>. From now on, “Lego Fortnite” will be the name of the hub inside of <em>Fortnite</em> that houses all of the Lego experiences. Epic and Lego have been steadily expanding their partnership over the last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun">launching new games</a> and also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106477/lego-fortnite-user-created-games-epic">letting <em>Fortnite</em> players build their own Lego games</a>.</p><div><p>The ongoing collaboration between Lego and <em>Fortnite</em> could provide a hint at what to expect from the upcoming “persistent universe” that Epic and Disney are making together, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">following a $1.5 billion investment from Disney in February</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">we’ve heard very little specifics</a> about what the virtual world might look like.</p></div><p>Meanwhile, Epic has also announced that <em>Fortnite</em> is getting support for a revamped version of text chat, which will be available as an option across all of its experiences starting on December 10th. There will be three kinds of text chat available: party channel for talking with your squad; game channel for a public conversation with people on the same island; and DMs with people on your friends list.</p><div><p>Epic says there will be two kinds of chat filters — one that removes personal information, and another that filters out “various kinds of mature language and toxicity” — which will be on by default for any players under the age of 13. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23962354/epic-games-fortnite-report-voice-conversations">The feature will also include a reporting system similar to the voice reporting tool Epic launched last year</a>. Here’s an example of what text chats look like in the game:</p></div><div><p>All of these announcements come at a particularly busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The battle royale game is currently in the midst of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">a brand-new chapter</a> that kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">following an ambitious music-themed season</a>, and Epic also recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">brought back the nostalgia-filled <em>Fortnite</em> OG as a permanent mode</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">Epic just announced “Ballistic,”</a> a multiplayer first-person shooter mode that launches inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 11th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-reaches-10-million-in-just-72-hours.1055718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced that its online superhero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major player count milestone just a few days after its initial release.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>X account, the game has crossed the 10 million player mark already, which is particularly impressive given that the announcement was made almost exactly 72 hours after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' launch on Friday.</p>

<p>In the post, NetEase thanks "each and every one" of the people who have checked out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>so far and shares a special piece of artwork depicting some of the game's interpretations of classic Marvel characters like Wolverine, Hawkeye, and, uh, Squirrel Girl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=1oOjPhrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=UlZJaAp8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>seems to have proven pretty popular among players.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting this player count doesn't necessarily translate to revenue for NetEase;&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is free-to-play, after all, and all of its heroes are unlocked for all players at the start of the game, although a battle pass is up for sale if you do want to shell out some real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, a quick look at <i>Marvel Rivals</i>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a> shows that the game still appears to be going pretty strong. Its 24-hour player count peak sits at 480,990 at time of writing, with 296,557 players currently playing the third-person hero shooter.</p>

<p>That's without taking into account player numbers on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Naturally, many of those 10 million players will have jumped in to check the game out and will have no intention of sticking around, but it's still safe to call&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>a success, I think.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a third-person multiplayer hero shooter created by NetEase Games.</p>

<p>Bearing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">more than a passing resemblance</a> to Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>sees teams of Marvel heroes and villains competing against one another to complete objectives like holding territory or escorting a moving object to its destination.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

That’s happening again today, as the Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1 launches, joining the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event and the Bulbasaur-themed Wonder Pick Event. And while it’s strange, it makes it a great time to pick up the game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Emblem Events are, in my opinion, the best of the current rotation of special challenges the mobile card game offers. They’re focused on battling other real-world players rather than the game’s mediocre AI, and with far better rewards than the standard for-the-hell-of-it battles that’ll only net you thimbles of XP. The current Venusaur Drop event against the CPU certainly gives you something to do, but go into it with a half-competent fire deck and you’ll have won all the good loot within half an hour. Emblem Events, named for the badge-like prizes rewarded that you can display on your profile, offer a tastier challenge against real people, with decks you don’t know in advance.</p><p>With <em>Pocket</em>’s signature bemusing lack of clarity, the new event is titled “Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1.” And if you’re thinking, “Hang on, I’m pretty sure that already happened,” then no, silly, you’re thinking of “Genetic Apex Emblem Event 1,” which took place in November. Don’t you look daft.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s New Venusaur Event Features The Most Beautiful Card</a></span></p><p>SP stands for...ummm...“consecutive wins”? Yeah, no, it doesn’t make a lick of sense. But that’s the goal here: winning multiple matches in a row, which is so much juicier than anything that’s come before. Last month’s version was just about accruing wins overall, but this is much tougher. <em>And</em> it’s also uncharacteristically generous in its first handful of prizes, awarded just for participation!</p><p>For playing once, whether you win or lose, you get three of the coveted Pack Hourglasses, then another three for playing three battles, and once you hit five matches, you get six more hourglasses! That’s enough for a whole new pack, just for playing five times. Then there’s another 12 for battling ten times! Two packs, just for goofing around in the event, is—pleasingly and also miserably—better than the challenge rewards you get for paying the $10 a month for the god-awful Premium Pass. (There’s also 150 Shinedust for winning three battles, but that’s <em>rubbish</em>.)</p><p>The gloat-worthy prizes are the emblems, with four on offer, each increasingly more grand than the last, awarded for winning from two to five battles in a row. So having that crowned picture on your profile comes with some earned bragging rights.</p><p>It’s a short event, only lasting seven days, so get cracking. And don’t forget to gather Bulbasaur and Magnemite cards in the current Wonder Pick Event, and all the promo cards dropped in the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event. Woo!

The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store page</a> also features fake selling points and even fake awards from video game websites, including IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Most Anticipated Game About Making The Most Anticipated Game!” reads the game page. “You're now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster... Or masterpiece? Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/gta-1733750215619.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Taking Ages VI is meant to be a parody of GTA 6. Image credit: PlayStation Store.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Taking Ages VI is supposedly inspired by real gaming industry events, and “delivers a satirical take on game development and the endless wait for certain highly anticipated titles.” It promises a release before October 2025, or before when the developer expects Grand Theft Auto 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the developer, the PlayStation Store page mentions Violarte sp. z o. O., which appears to be a Polish company. The website for Violarte was only created recently, and contains fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Sony and Violarte for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Grand Taking Ages VI should obviously not be taken seriously, its appearance on the PlayStation Store does call into question Sony’s curation process. The PlayStation Store has seen a number of questionable games over the years, but all the major video game storefronts struggle with this issue. The likes of Steam, the various app stores, and even the Nintendo eShop are packed with slop. And who can forget God of War rip-off War Gods Zeus of Child, which appeared on the Xbox store back in 2022?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Grand Taking Ages VI, its appearance on the PlayStation Store is likely not long for this world. “In memory of those who didn't have a chance to live till this moment (and those who gave up waiting and bought a PS6 instead),” the description concludes. “PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Scuf has announced a new Squid Game-themed version of its Instinct Pro wireless controller for Xbox and PC. The gamepad will launch for $240 on December 20, and fans can <a href="https://howl.link/3a0w69zwbvtnb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17335361778507?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder it now at Best Buy</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the unique visual design, the rest of the controller matches the features of the standard Scuf Instinct Pro, including four rear remappable paddles and the ability to save and swap up to three mappings with the press of a button. The controller also offers interchangeable thumbstick styles--including a taller stick with a domed top--and Scuf's Instant Triggers (trigger locks). It supports Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC via wireless and wired connections.</p><p dir="ltr">At $240, the Squid Game Pink Guard Edition is just $10 more than the standard Instinct Pro, so if you're in the admittedly niche overlap of Squid Game fans looking for a pro-style controller for Xbox or PC--or you really like the color pink--this is a good option. That said, if the feature set caught your eye but you would prefer a different color option, you can grab the Scuf Instinct Pro for just $190 (was $230) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B0BB3CG33L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/osymo21vg5ee4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17335363731871?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

It's available in Steel Grey, White/Gray, and White/Black color schemes.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Instinct Pro is one of many pro-style controllers competing with Microsoft's Elite Series 2 Pro, our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/" data-ref-id="1100-6473486">best premium Xbox controller</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's worth noting that the Elite Series 2 is on sale for its best price of the year at multiple retailers.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mighty-morphin%E2%80%99-power-rangers-rita%E2%80%99s-rewind-review.1055682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Right, let’s get this out of the way early, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind sadly isn’t very good. I know, I know, I’m as disappointed as you are as this felt like it would be the second coming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> just with Power Rangers – who are probably, maybe, just as awesome as our friendly neighbourhood heroes in a half-shell. A 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em up with retro arcade visuals and shoot ‘em up sections, I mean, what could go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off though, in terms of what it <em>does</em> get right, Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind absolutely nails the aesthetic. The opening theme-music drips nostalgia and superbly sets the tone, giving you all of the retro feels. For people of a certain age, this is your childhood, but in 2024. Even better, the game itself has the sheen of a coin-up arcade screen overlaying the visuals, really cementing the sense of playing this game in your local arcade – you know, the one that no longer exists.</p>


<p>The chunky pixellated characters have a lot of charm, the Rangers themselves ninja flipping smoothly across the levels, whilst the never-ending horde of Putties you face are decent, if rather bland, punching bags. Thankfully, the look of the bosses is much more like it, correctly channelling the Saturday-morning TV shoddiness of the original much-loved Power Rangers series.</p>
<p>Smartly, the game is subdivided into a TV episode structure. Your team of Rangers face reams of goons, before battling a boss who, of course, runs off. You give chase in your Dinozord, blasting away in shooting sections that honour the almost-3D sequences of Sega’s classic game Afterburner. Then the boss gets biggified and your Dinozords combine to build the mech-like Megazord, resulting in a ginormous scrap.</p>


<p>Sadly, once you get to actually playing Power Rangers: Rita’s Revenge, things fall apart pretty quickly. Beat ‘em up sections are dull and pedestrian, with lacklustre collision detection proving a constant irritation. Think you’re lined up on the correct parallel plain to punch a Putty? Well, the game is pretty sure you are wrong, every time. Resulting in your Ranger unleashing a devastating flurry of fist-based pain on some innocent thin air.</p>
<p>Next to nothing of interesting or note happens across a level either; you pummel the same small selection of goons again and again and there are no weapons to pick-up or vehicles to control. Even local co-op fails to elevate proceedings, due to the Rangers themselves playing exactly the same. Sure, their disappointingly limited range of attacks look a bit different, but they have identical form and function. Unlike, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge you won’t find any levelling up or new attacks to unlock here, just the same paltry selection of attack combos, jumps and throws.</p>
<p>Even the ultimate attacks are basically just colour-pallet swaps; the lack of imagination here, considering the rich and varied source-material, is truly disheartening. Indeed, the only interesting occurrence as you walk from left to right is when a Putty comes out with a green time crystal that rewinds time – admittedly accompanied by neat VHS effects – until you destroy it. Though this one good idea is itself rewound and reused so many times that it is soon rendered dull.</p>

<p>Whilst the beat ‘em up section are serviceable but uninspired, the shoot ‘em-up sections are a mess. Visually incoherent with a smorgasbord of explosions and effects, it’s almost impossible to tell where your Dinozord is as it runs towards the horizon, let alone navigate all the obstacles and enemies heading your way. Unlike Afterburner, Outrun or other arcade titles from the era, these shoot ‘em up section fail to recreate any sense of depth, resulting in even more confusion as everything is given a flat appearance. Good luck trying to tell to how close a runaway truck is, as it supposedly careens its way into your path. Irritating and pointless, the shoot ‘em up levels of this game should have been made skippable.</p>
<p>Which just leaves the Megazord smackdowns, which, frankly, suck. Played from a first-person perspective, the players pass the controller and take it in turn to battle the villain of the week. Dodging attacks, finding an opening, punching the big baddy and charging up your sword is the format. It’s kind of interesting in your first encounter with Goldar, but the same boss-fight structure with a different character model is repeated ad-nauseum.</p>

<p>Controls here are loose and inexact, and the whole thing is frustrating and poorly conceived, with little sense of satisfaction if you emerge triumphant as your victory was likely more down to luck than any skill or intention. You know when players are choosing to skip their go, that this part of the game is a dud.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie storefront Itch.io was taken offline for several hours earlier today owing to what the site's owner describes as a "bogus phishing report" for a fanmade page based on the Funko toy property.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Itch.io says its site was "taken down by Funko" due to "trash 'AI Powered' brand protection software called BrandShield", which flagged a page on the site as fraud, leading to domain registrar IWantMyName to "ignore" Itch.io's response, "just disabl[ing] the domain".</p>

<p>Over on YCombinator's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News portal</a>, Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran provides some additional context. He says that someone "made a fan page" for Funko video game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, and that page contained "links to the official site and screenshots of the game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=6hgGTbKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=MFg27tw3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A fan-made&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>Itch.io page is apparently what led to the site being shut down for several hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Corcoran speculates that the aforementioned BrandShield software is "probably instructed to eradicate all 'unauthorized' use of [Funko's] trademark", and so the software sent phishing and fraud reports to Itch.io's domain registrar.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he first received reports of the alerts from IWantMyName and host Linode "about 5 or 6 days ago", and that he had removed the offending page and disabled the associated account. The matter was settled with Linode fairly swiftly, while IWantMyName "never responded" to Corcoran's actions.</p>

<p>The Itch.io site owner says he's "assuming no-one on [IWantMyName's] end 'closed' the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days".</p>

<p>The whole debacle rather sounds like a series of automated systems being set off for circumstances they should probably never even have raised an eyebrow at, but at any rate, Itch.io is now back up, so there's that, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=nAKf0auw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=wwMs9_5I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran lays the blame for the site's outage squarely at "brand protection" suite BrandShield's door.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, several developers and industry figures have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/djlink.bsky.social/post/3lcuf4dlf2s2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Itch.io's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3lcuiisohfs2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">outage</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lcuf5bqfwc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disappointment</a> at Funko and BrandShield, which isn't hard to understand given that the outage meant many indie devs couldn't sell their products for a number of hours.</p>

<p>Given that Itch.io routinely raises quite a lot of money <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-ukraine-bundle-raises-63-million" rel="nofollow">for charity</a> -&nbsp; as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-black-friday-sale-gives-creators-all-revenue" rel="nofollow">developers themselves</a> - with its bundles and fundraising efforts, it's probably in Funko and BrandShield's best interests to make sure this doesn't happen again, assuming they are the ones at fault.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now available alongside today’s full launch of the game. It’s a big one for PC gamers, with the addition of path tracing (AKA full ray tracing) for NVidia GPUs, but there’s also bug fixes across the game.</p>
<p>Path tracing completely replaces the game’s lighting and reflections using the ray tracing tech built into Nvidia GPUs, where the fallback mode is a hybrid that includes ray traced global illumination and more traditional techniques for light, reflections, shadows and the like. It will be equivalent to the path tracing option that was patched in for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>… and it’s similarly expensive on the GPU, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/indiana-jones-and-the-giant-circle-minimum-specs-recommended-ultra-pc-requirements-4k-ray-tracing/">MachineGames recommending GeForce RTX 40 Series cards</a> and requiring the use of upscaling.</p>


<p>Speaking of which, the only upscaling techniques are currently Nvidia’s DLSS and a generic TAAU, but AMD FSR will be added in a future update. Oh, and a pesky dynamic resolution bug that affected us when playing with an AMD GPU has also been fixed by this update.</p>
<p>Out now across PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and via certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances.

			<p>Bloodborne's emulation on PC is continuing to get improved almost daily, thanks to new updates to the ShadPS4 emulator and mods that improve the game's visuals to provide a truly remastered experience.</p>
<p>The latest work-in-progress build of the ShadPS4 emulator, version 0.4.1, addresses some of the issues that have been causing frequent crashing while playing the PlayStation 4 exclusive on PC, such as RAM usage spikes, and excessive VRAM usage, as reported in a new video shared by tabeneru on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>. The new version of the emulator seems to reduce VRAM usage considerably, so the game should now run better on a variety of system configurations.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 0.4.1 WIP - Bloodborne PC Huge Improvement (RAM SPIKE FIX &amp; VRAM USAGE REDUCED)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYN56lE-Fi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides general emulation improvements that are also benefiting the game, Bloodborne is getting improved by the hard work of modders. Today, a new version of the Enable Dynamic Shadow mod was released on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/160?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, further improving the dynamic shadows the mod introduces. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements-video/">fromsoftserve's remastering project</a> also does the same, this mod is being manually tuned for the best results. You can check out how much dynamic shadows improve the game's visuals in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Bloodborne is only one of the games that the ShadPS4 emulator can run reasonably well on PC.

            <p>The big question a Tekken player always wants to know is: which DLC character is coming next? Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

<p>You see the helicopter chasing Nina Williams at 2:12? It has a lipsticky kiss mark on the missile, a nod to scrappy sister Anna Williams, the red roughhouser to Nina's purple pugilist. That puts Anna a good bet for the reveal, but who knows? It could all be a scarlet red herring. The developers are planning to reveal all on Thursday evening (that's the wee hours of Friday morning for us in the UK).</p>
<p>More concretely, the trailer promises new moves for every chracter, in case the hundred attacks of the average character aren't enough for you (I see my favourite coffee baroness Azucena performing a freshly brewed sweepy kick). There's also going to be a "major balance update", which for Tekken often means a lot of changes to frame data for various attacks across all characters. Finally, the trailer pumps up the Tekken World Tour - the annual fraternal fisticuffs that is often interesting but I most fondly remember for 	<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-tekken-player-in-the-world-is-a-panda">crowning a Panda as the globe's best bare-knuckle brawler</a>.</p><p>But that's all Season 2 stuff. Players will get the winter update before all that, and it is slightly less dramatic. It'll offer the gift of extra photo mode features, for example. This will let you add "wetness" and "grime" to fighters' faces (it's just what I always wanted!). You'll also soon be able to search for other players online by username. Extra slots for customised characters will get added early next year too, say the devs.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Iron Fist Tournament is pretty slick, as I judged in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>. But it's also missing the characters I love most (Lei, Miguel, Josie), which is ultimately why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> is the bruiser that got onto our list of the best games, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the RPS 100</a>. Anna, she's cool and all. But can she pretend to be drunk and roll around on the ground to freak out her opponent? No. </p>

<p>If you head to the Australian Classification Board <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will see that Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been classified as ‘RC’ or ‘Refused Classification’. The website has not provided a reason for refusing classification and has asked fans to contact them for further clarification on their decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian Classification Board provided a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/489089/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-refused-classification-australia-ban-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> regarding the classification of Hunter x Hunter Nen X Impact, explaining that the game was refused classification due to “a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Australian Classification Board added:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Board noted in its report that the implied sexual violence is implicitly condoned as appropriate due to a lack of resolution of the act through the game’s narrative and that it is not justified by context. Implied sexual violence that is visually depicted, interactive, not justified by context, or related to incentives or rewards is not permitted.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact does not have a concrete release date, but it is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

Others, however, believe the bottom left 'finger' is simply flesh falling off the little finger above it, although there are irregularities with the present boxes and ribbons in the bottom right, too. Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244480-1-1733745842140.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen.

It contains what looks like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244200-1-1733745876407.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community have now called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now calling on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold. And as others have pointed out, Steam operator Valve now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI disclosure rules</a> that call on publishers and developers to describe how they use AI in the development and execution of their games. As part of this, Valve has told developers it will include their disclosures on the Steam store page of their game, “so customers can also understand how the game uses AI.” Currently, Call of Duty’s Steam page has no such disclosure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>It's once again that special time of year when we give you a chance to do well by doing good. That's right—it's time for the 2024 edition of our annual Charity Drive!</p>
<p>Every year <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/11/the-opposable-thumbs-childs-play-giveaway-you-donate-we-give-you-stuff/">since 2007</a>, we've encouraged readers to give to <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/">Penny Arcade's Child's Play charity</a>, which provides toys and games to kids being treated in hospitals around the world. In recent years, we've added&nbsp;the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> to our charity push, aiding in their efforts to defend Internet freedom. This year, as always, we're providing some extra incentive for those donations by offering donors a chance to win pieces of our big pile of vendor-provided swag. We can't keep it, and we don't want it clogging up our offices, so it's now yours to win.</p>
<p>This year's swag pile is full of high-value geek goodies. <strong>We have dozens of prizes valued at over $4,000 total</strong>, including gaming hardware and collectibles, computer accessories, apparel, and more. In 2023, Ars readers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/ars-readers-gave-nearly-40000-in-our-2023-charity-drive/">raised nearly $40,000 for charity</a>, contributing to a total haul of <strong>more than $506,000 since 2007.</strong> We want to raise even more this year, and we can do it if readers dig deep.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Donating is easy. Simply <a href="https://childsplay.salsalabs.org/Donate/index.html">donate to Child's Play</a> using a credit card or PayPal or <a href="http://eff.org/AT2014">donate to the EFF</a> using PayPal, credit card, or cryptocurrency. You can also support Child's Play directly by using <a href="https://my.onecause.com/fundraiser/organizations/8534d777-53ce-4d94-a537-c8e0cbb7acb0/fundraisers/fundraiser:ae0c129c-94ac-4e63-a265-20b71ac4bd03">this Ars Technica campaign page</a> or picking an item from the Amazon wish list of a specific hospital on <a href="https://childsplaycharity.org/get-involved#hospital-map">its donation page</a>. Donate as much or as little as you feel comfortable with—every little bit helps.</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco's shuttered MMORPG Blue Protocol project has been extended a new lifeline courtesy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded developer Bokura.</p>
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Bandai Namco announced plans to shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol</a> in Japan and cancelled its release in the West altogether, saying "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>

<p>Now, however, Blue Protocol has been reincarnated as Star Resonance, with some of its original development team joining the new one at Bokura. Although set in the same world as Blue Protocol, Regnas, the team said Star Resonance players can expect a reworked gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>And it seems Bokura has hit the ground running, too. A <a href="https://bpm.bkrgame.com/web202412/news-detail.html?newsid=18543902">closed beta test</a> is already planned for players on Android devices and PC, although sadly, that's only open to Chinese players for now.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date either in China, Japan, or beyond. Blue Protocol's servers are due to go dark on 18th January 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namcos-unsuccessful-mmorpg-blue-protocol-to-be-reincarnated-as-star-resonance-by-chinese-studio/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, he had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks stunning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/">path tracing</a>, but even the most powerful GPUs currently on the market cannot run the game at native 4K resolution and max setting at anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Making some compromises in terms of settings and resolution, however, definitely looks worth it, as path tracing makes the game developed by MachineGames outright stunning, as highlighted in a comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TyrianYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyrian</a> on YouTube. The video also clearly shows how an RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 60 FPS during the introduction sequence at 4K resolution and with NVIDIA DLSS at the Balanced setting.</p>

<p>Much like the other games supporting path tracing like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes it pretty clear that it will be some time until it will be possible to run games with full path tracing at high native resolutions, as even an RTX 4090 cannot push past the 30 FPS mark at native 4K resolution and max settings, as shown in the test shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mostly_Positive_Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mostly Positive Reviews</a>. The most powerful GPU on the market struggles at native 1440p resolution as well, barely hitting the 50 FPS range in the most demanding of the two testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Leaks about upcoming playable Marvel Rivals characters have surfaced online, revealing new details about Ultron and The Thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-the-thing-leak">Marvel Rivals The Thing Leak</h2>



<p>The Thing is set to be <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865513703044485624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another Tank</a> for Marvel Rivals. The character’s passive ability is Solid as a Rock, which makes him immune to enemy knockback and displacement effects. The character’s primary attack is Combination Punch, which releases quick and continuous punches. Their secondary attack is Thunderbolt Punch, which releases a devastating blow at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Thing’s E ability in Marvel Rivals is Battlefield Support, which will make him jump towards teammates and reduce damage for allies and himself. His L Shift move is Furious Charge, which triggers a Continuous Forward charge that pummels enemies in your way and leaves a seismic zone behind you. Lastly, The Thing’s ultimate is called Slam Moment, and it knocks all enemies in front of you in the air.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ultron-leak-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Ultron Leak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As per <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalLeaks</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Ultron will be a supporting character in Marvel Rivals. His primary attack will be the Encephalo-Ray, an energy beam, and his secondary move is Dynamic Flight, which allows him to quickly fly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode. Ultron’s E ability is Imperative: Firewall, which provides health to allies within range with the help of drones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultron’s L Shift ability in Marvel Rivals is Imperative: Patch, which releases a giant drone that follows an ally, healing them and others within range. Ultron’s passive ability, called Algorithm Correction, allows him to jump and fall slowly. His ultimate is Rage of Ultron, which releases Ultron Drones that Encephalo-Rays at enemies or heal allies. RivalLeaks added in another post that Ultron might be released <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865940057988935760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sooner than we think</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Marvel Rivals has not officially announced The Thing or Ultron as upcoming playable characters.</p>

            <p>
A year has now passed since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-things-we-noticed-in-the-gta-6-trailer-you-may-have-missed">Rockstar's record-breaking first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer</a> landed, and there's been no real news on the game since.
</p>
<p>
While some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-fans-think-rockstars-hidden-yet-another-clue-in-the-moon">fans look to GTA 6's moon for word on when we'll hear more</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands - by going back to last December's trailer and using it to build bits of the game for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
There are several shots in the video below by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FyfT3zs3mQ">Dark Space</a> that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the real thing. The video shows a street from Vice Beach and some of the  downtown Stockyard area recreated using custom assets and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> engine.

Later, Dark Space mocks up a rumoured cutscene, where players will apparently hook a chain to a safe to rip it out of a pawn shop using a truck. As they say, it'll be interesting to see how close to the final game all of this looks - whenever the time comes.
</p><p>
There's also a section where we see the estimated size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map from above, as a plane flies over both it and the GTA 5 map at the same speed. The inferrance here is that GTA 6's map will be bigger than its predecessor's - though this was to be expected, and exact measurements are likely best saved for the final game.

Rockstar publisher Take-Two has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6 set to launch in late 2025</a>. Next year is a big one for the company, with Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country both also set to arrive between April 2025 and the end of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-reveal-trailer-brilliantly-recreated-in-real-life">GTA 6 reveal trailer has been recreated</a>. Earlier this year, fans remade the video using real-life footage and actors.
</p>
<p>Speaking of actors, our Christian Donlan recently took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">Grand Theft Hamlet, a luminous documentary about staging Shakespeare inside GTA Online</a> that brings fresh nuance to the game and bard alike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has released a new job trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile, showing its touchscreen battles for the first time.</p>
<p>The UI for Final Fantasy 14 - as with many MMORPGs - is particularly complex, with each job (or class) having multiple abilities mapped out on a player's hotbar. With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">announcement of Final Fantasy 14 Mobile</a>, many players wondered how this would transition to a mobile touchscreen.</p>
<p>Well now we know. The trailer - <a href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5108677439324201">shared on Chinese social media site Weibo</a> - includes battle animations for all of the nine starting jobs, with their various job actions located in the bottom right of the screen around a large central primary attack used for continuous combos.</p>

<p>Players can then cycle through abilities, with cooldowns clearly displayed, while health and MP are located at the bottom of the screen as always.</p>
<p>It's tidy but, personally, looks far too small. When some jobs have up to 11 abilities to choose from, those ability icons look impossible to accurately select, while the fonts are tiny.</p>
<p>The trailer also does not include any character movement during battle, perhaps suggesting a simplified battle system without positionals (attacks where position around an enemy is vital for dealing damage). This also means there's no dodging of AoE attacks in this trailer, though perhaps that's indicative of a lazy player relying too much on their healer (we all know this from bitter experience).</p><p>Speaking of healing, the Scholar and White Mage jobs are the only characters in the trailer to switch targets (all others face a single enemy). It's still unclear how switching between friend and foe will work, though appears to be a quick direct tap of the screen - something else that could get fiddly in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Still, it's impressive to see running and appears faithful to the original experience. Fans appear particularly impressed by the Monk and Summoner animations.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will be free-to-play without gacha, and will follow the base game A Realm Reborn.</p> <div>
