                <p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that GameChat, one of Nintendo's purported marquee features for the upcoming Switch 2, did not show well when it was first revealed. The introduction to the feature in the Switch reveal trailer looked choppy and poor quality. While I and others gave them credit for showing the feature in a "warts and all" state, it was a confusing choice to center so much of the presentation around a video-sharing function that looked, well, bad. Having now spent some time with GameChat at an extensive hands-on preview, I can't say I'm confident that the final quality will be any better than we saw--but I am sure that the ease of use and system integration make it a nicer prospect than it first appeared.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/">first hands-on with the Switch 2</a>, GameChat was fully enabled for this session, which meant I was free to poke around the options and see how it all worked. GameChat is a main-menu option right alongside others like the Nintendo eShop and controller settings, so it's easy to find even without the dedicated button. But the C button does call up the menu quickly, which is nice for toggling its various options on and off.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those options include voice, video, and game sharing--the latter being the less-than-stellar game feed from your friends. You can turn on any combination of these options, and as promised, you can bring up your friend's game screen to watch them. It came up after a short delay and ran more smoothly than the choppy video shown in the Direct, when it was the main video feed. I should say, though, that the game being showcased for this feature was Zelda: Four Swords Adventures running through the GBA Classics app, so it wasn't exactly a game that was taxing system resources like Mario Kart World. The connection was also running via LAN rather than Wi-Fi, so that could have also conceivably improved my experience.</p><p dir="ltr">We played a short tutorial of Four Swords Adventures across multiple consoles with GameChat on, and we were allowed to toggle whichever features we liked, as well as explore some of the various options. If you just want to chat and don't care about sharing video, you can go full-screen and still see your friends' voices lighting up in the corner when they speak. You can turn on voice-to-text and see a text box offering what is at least a close approximation (with some understandable typos) of what they've said, identified with their usernames. That feature is offered as an accessibility option but could also be useful for those of us who play with the volume low when family members are asleep. The system also does a decent job automatically raising and lowering the game volume to accommodate voices, if you have that option selected.</p><p dir="ltr">It also seems smartly targeted at ease of use and families, which you'd expect from Nintendo, and the company commented on it when it first debuted the feature. You can quickly turn off individual shared screens--for example, if a friend is playing an M-rated game and your young children enter the room. Nintendo has also detailed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-parental-controls-let-you-block-kids-from-using-video-in-gamechat/1100-6531978/">kid-safe features</a> to make sure your children are only interacting with whitelisted contacts. And if you see your friend playing a game you don't recognize, it's easy to hop into its game page for more information.</p><p dir="ltr">None of these features are exactly revolutionary, and in many ways GameChat and GameShare represent Nintendo catching up to the norms of online play on other platforms. But it is smartly implemented and user-friendly in a way that feels characteristic for Nintendo's general sense of ease, if not its history with online connectivity. I'm still not convinced GameChat is a marquee feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. But after eight years of playing on the first Switch, it's a solid nice-to-have that makes the successor that much more appealing.</p>

                <p>Poinpy, a platformer from developer Ojiro Fumoto AKA Moppin and published by Devolver, launched in 2022 exclusively through Netflix, but it's going away soon. The game will be removed on June 9, according to a disclaimer in the Netflix mobile app.</p><p>A spokesperson for Devolver <a href="https://discord.com/channels/439391039720259585/439391040508657666/1372345262772584548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Discord</a> that the company's deal with Netflix is ending, which is why Poinpy is leaving the Netflix catalog.</p><p>"The deal with Netflix has expired, so as you already know, Poinpy will leave Netflix very soon. For the time being, Poinpy will become unavailable, and we know this sucks," the person, Modkiq, said. "With how these integrations work, Poinpy will require further development in order to be releasable in other stores, and realistically we do not know when we would have time in between other projects."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kKWuKXHyfw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6kKWuKXHyfw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What this means in essence is that when Poinpy leaves Netflix, it won't be available anywhere until it is potentially brought to another system--but there is no guarantee that will ever happen. It's not clear what will happen if you already have Poinpy installed on your mobile device after it's removed from the catalog.</p><p>Poinpy isn't the first game to leave the Netflix catalog, as Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition left in 2024. GTA: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition remains available on Netflix, however.</p><p>"Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-grand-theft-auto-games-are-leaving-netflixs-game-library-soon/1100-6527923/" data-ref-id="1100-6527923">confirmed in 2024.</a></p><p>Netflix's library of games can be played on mobile devices by way of downloads or streamed over the internet on your TV or browser. There are no microtransactions or in-game ads for any of the games.</p>

According to groups like the Entertainment Software Association, the answer is "yes." Its lawyers argue that making older games publicly available through digital libraries would harm the commercial interests of IP holders, who it says are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/u-s-copyright-office-rejects-dmca-exemption-to-support-game-preservation">the true arbiters of preservation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But according to Marcin Paczyński, senior business development manager at GOG, the answer is "no."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a conversation at the 2025 Game Developers Conference, Paczyński explained that preservation is becoming the backbone of the CD Projekt-owned storefront. In November 2024 the company unveiled the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-expands-preservation-program-to-protect-delisted-games">GOG Preservation Platform</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an initiative to ensure games sold through the platform will be backwards compatible on every PC in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Preservation Platform isn't just a label on the storefront. GOG engineers are working hard behind the scenes to solve compatibility bugs on every game run through the program using a custom DirectX wrapper to ensure a game released for MS-DOS will work on all future versions of Windows by translating the game purely to DirectX instead of Vulkan, the format used by XVK. Using the wrapper also allows GOG engineers to solve compatibility errors by fixing the wrapper itself, instead of making updates game-by-game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/with-an-ipo-on-the-way-let-s-dig-into-discord-s-revenue-strategy" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord's rumored IPO has us digging into its revenue strategy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As long as Microsoft maintains support for DirectX, all games that possess the wrapper will be backward compatible. (Mac and Linux support is hopefully on the way).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developing and maintaining that wrapper costs money, with 15 years of development already invested in its functionality. Paczyński said that it was only early last year that deploying it on a large scale became commercially feasible, thanks to tooling advancements and sufficient revenue through GOG.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As he described it, a commercial venture targeting preservation isn't just good business for GOG and publishers with back catalogues—it's vital for keeping classic video games available to the public.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Compatibility is deteriorating.&quot;">"Compatibility is deteriorating."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Preservation Program came to life after the team at GOG had two major assumptions upended. First, they assumed the majority of games sold on GOG were fully compatible with modern machines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nope. Only thirty percent were fully up-to-par. Players were purchasing classic games and just not reporting any issues if they ran into a compatibility error.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second, they assumed the public—and publishers listing games on the platform—knew that GOG was maintaining about 4,000 of the 11,000 games on the marketplace.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-was-really-wearing-people-down-the-funding-challenges-that-followed-runaway-success-another-crab-s-treasure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It was really wearing people down:' The funding challenges that followed 'runaway success' Another Crab's Treasure</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nope. They did market research and found people had zero idea about their hard work. Everyone thought the games it worked on were being maintained by the original developers. "That was like a bucket of cold water," Paczyński said with a groan. "That's one of the reasons that that we're addressing with this." When players ask "why should I buy a game on GOG and not on Steam?," he wants there to be a clear answer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that answer is this: Steam is a great place to buy new games, and GOG is a great place to buy "back catalogue" games. "There is no way in heaven that Steam will spend resources of fixing other people's games," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers have also warmed up to this pitch since GOG doesn't charge any extra money for this maintenance. It's funded by the storefront fees taken from every game purchase. It's not "free," but it's not a service developers have to budget for. "We are crazy like that," admitted Paczyński.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GOG's DRM-free business model was the spark that lit the fire of this project. Because DRM will inevitably stop working, only DRM-free games can be truly preserved. Sometimes publishers strip away DRM years after a game's initial launch, but if a publisher goes under, there's no one left to do that task.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry's adoption of DRM in the 2000s has created a ticking clock. "Compatibility is deteriorating," Paczyński claimed. He pointed to the differences among versions of games listed on the Preservation Program versus versions that live on Steam and other platforms. Developers and players can view the changelogs GOG publishes that document updates. If a game is sold on Steam and sold on GOG, the version sold on Steam won't have the compatibility improvements made possible by the DirectX wrapper.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bloober-ceo-creating-a-safe-sustainable-workplace-takes-priority-in-studio-leadership" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bloober CEO: creating a 'safe,' sustainable workplace takes priority in studio leadership</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's this process that Paczyński believes makes true preservation possible. "Preservation is not only about you having a physical copy somewhere in the closet. It's about keeping those games available and maintaining them. And because maintenance is a continuous process. It never ends."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With funding for video game preservation already tenuous, GOG's commercial venture is what's making that continuous process possible.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There are still major hurdles to solve in commercial game preservation">There are still major hurdles to solve in commercial game preservation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paczyński is optimistic about the progress made preserving games on GOG. The company is using a "dream list" to solicit votes from players on what they want added to the program, and more publishers are signing off on having their games included. Back catalogues are key for driving revenue between game releases, and GOG has opened the door for more diversified sales.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher is excited about this. GOG Game Preservation launched with a promise to fully preserve the first two Warcraft games made by Blizzard Entertainment.

"It wasn't a good day... when we heard that news," Paczyński said delicately. "But this is not new for GOG. Games are delisted for many different reasons. We have no control over that... because it's our partner's decision and responsibility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GOG also has to step carefully when obtaining older games and putting them up for sale. That's true even if a developer or publisher closed its doors years and years ago and a game could be considered "abandonware." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Someone</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> still owns the rights to a game, and the company has had to fend off lawsuits from law firms fishing for clients who may not be aware they even own those rights. Tracking down those rights and getting all the contracts signed is time-consuming and costs money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a more positive note, Paczyński said GOG is looking at methods for preserving classic mods. Steam did its own version of this years ago through Steam Workshop, but not all developers include Steam Workshop support for their games. That means players who want to play say, the original Long War mod for Firaxis' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have to go through a complicated process of installing different files instead of just clicking a single button like they can for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>XCOM 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's also the fact that, if it wasn't for modding communities, many games would already be lost to the sands of time. "A lot of those classic games—classic meaning they were made ten [or more] years ago—are being kept alive because of the amazing modding communities," Paczyński said. GOG's preservation mission wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for modders tinkering away for free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these variables are the reason Paczyński sees game preservation as a commercial process—one that benefits GOG, publishers, and the nonprofit archival community alike.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's a continuous effort but because it's connected to business, we are actually able to make it happen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">organizations</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> under Informa.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>A first look at in-game gameplay of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has just been shown off during today's State of Unreal stream.
</p><p>
During its time on the stage, we saw some in-game cinematics of a monster attacking a wagon, and Ciri coming across the scene some time later. It then transitioned into gameplay, with Kajetan Kapuscinski cinematic director at CD Projekt Red playing through it.

</p><p>All this while Wyeth Johnson, senior director and project strategy at Epic Games, and Sebastian Kalemba, VP and game director at CD Projekt Red, narrated what we were seeing. This build was running on a standard PS5 at 60fps with ray tracing enabled, according to those on stage.

<p>We see some horse riding courtesy of Ciri's horse Kelpie. Kelpie has realitic muscles and skin movement thanks to the Unreal Chaos Flesh Solver and machine-learned deformations, so the horse will look natural without performance issues. We also see Nanite Foliage in action, which according to senior director Wyeth Johnson allows for fast-rendering high quality shrubbery and scenery.
</p>
<p>Ciri eventually comes to the city of Vargrest, filled with lots of NPCs rushing around and doing their own thing, be it looking at a bear or shopping at stalls. The build shows Ciri transition smoothly from gameplay to another in-game cinematic, leaning on a fence while talking to a quest giver.
</p>
<p>From here, the trio pull away from Ciri and look around the town some more, zooming in at NPCs chatting about fish with various nifty bits of tech at work. The idea expressed by Kalemba is that the difference between Ciri and your regular old NPC isn't too drastic.
</p>
<p>The build then has a circus added, with its crowd ramped up with an increasing number of NPCs reacting to the show without any visual stuttering or lag. Following this, Kalemba pulls back to Ciri one final time stating, "We're making this game to be the most immersive and ambitious open world Witcher game ever, and we're making this a reality thanks to our work on Unreal with the team at Epic."

<p>Recently in a CD Projekt financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">we learned development progress on The Witcher 4 was well underway</a>.

		<p>Mario Kart World is an inevitability. After Mario Kart 8 Deluxe became an almost mandatory purchase for the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo is banking on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> holding the same position for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>. There’s some big, bold new ideas that look to make this feel like a new generation of kart racer, most notably the jump to racing through an open world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World – The Final Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph5G4poDlS4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Switch 2 launching later this week, we’ve been able to spend a few hours with Mario Kart World at a preview event ahead of time. That’s let us dip into a bunch of the standard tracks, mess about with the many, many characters in the game, the open world and its P-Switch challenges, and the Knockout Tour elimination mode.</p>


<p>There’s some great touches throughout the game and it’s clear that, with Nintendo having first thought of trying to bring this game’s open world vision to the original Switch, they pushed on in what they were trying to do when shifting focus to the Nintendo Switch 2. So there’s some key things like being able to shift seamlessly from the main menu to driving around in the open world – no loading screens, just start driving from where that camera is pointing – and a mini-map that is a little birds eye view camera of the world, instead of an outline map. More fundamentally, there’s the wave simulations that roll through the large bodies of water that, while we’ve absolutely seen this kind of wave tech before – famously with Wave Race 64 – can be a taxing computational element to feature when also doing open world and fast multiplayer racing with larger lobbies. Maybe this could all have worked on the original Switch, but not when pushing 60fps or when pushing four-player local split-screen.</p>


<p>Of course, it really is the core Mario Kart racing that matters the most here, and there’s that immediate familiarity that you’ll feel in nailing that boost start timing and setting off to drift through corners and fling items at your rivals. It’s Mario Kart through and through… but it’s also a little bit different in ways that will challenge your muscle memory.</p>
<p>In particular, the new wall-riding and rail-grinding additions add new opportunities to the sides of tracks and through key areas. They’re tricky to pull off, and if you miss the start of a rail, you need to do a large jump to get up onto it. This move has you&nbsp;hold the right shoulder button and no directional inputs, fighting against the now instinctive way that you hop into a drift around a corner. Worse, any directional movement will still hop into a drift, which might be the last thing you want to do. It takes time, thought and effort to learn this after so many games learning this behaviour.</p>
<p>For the most part, these additional movement types are a nice extra. Grinding on the rail doesn’t increase your speed, but does give the opportunity to trick and gain mini boosts for a marginal advantage, and it seems that there’s almost always a secondary drop-down area if they are the primary route through an area.</p>

<p>The jump across to open world has brought other big changes to the game. There’s all these race tracks dotted across the world, some new, some returning, and they can all be raced in a traditional fashion… or you can race between them. In Grand Prix cups, the first race is always at a track, but each race after starts at the previous circuit, races to the next track, and finishes off with one or a few laps of it. It’s a huge change that makes the point-to-point racing that was a rare highlight of previous games into the main event of Mario Kart World. That’s before you consider the Knockout Tour, which joins up the open world roads through a bunch of circuits, knocking out the last four racers at each checkpoint and building up the pressure section-by-section.</p>
<p>It creates this odd blend of bespoke circuits that can be tight and twisty, lean in on certain ideas and themes, but that are then joined up by these big broad roadways. There’s huge banks of item boxes that are impossible to miss, there’s long straights and gently twisting sections that provide minimal challenge, but that doesn’t make them boring to drive. After all, there’s always the chaos of items coming your way, while road traffic that comes with ramps, cannons, has Hammer Bros. flinging hammers off the back of the truck, and more. Maybe it’s a wide open sea that you sail across, bouncing over waves and tricking constantly to get every slight advantage that you can.</p>

<p>That open world is, of course, completely open for you to explore at your leisure, whether when playing solo, or when waiting for your lobby of friends to fill up and the host to select the game mode. It’s interesting to see how Nintendo has tried to fill in the blank areas with P-Switches, giving mini missions and challenges that test your driving skill. Race around and collect blue coins, whizz through checkpoints, link together rail grinds, jumps and more with perfect timing, you know what to expect. The handful that I saw weren’t mind-blowing, but they’re going to be fun to find, and can scratch that same itch that all high score and skill check challenges do.</p>
<p>I almost feel that Nintendo is embracing some of the quirky messiness that open world racers can have, doing so out of necessity. There’s bound to be boring patches of the open world, weird end points like a pipe at the end of a corkscrew road that just spits you back out to go the other way, and the ability to just fling yourself across rooftops and other areas that were not intended for you to visit. So Nintendo has had to just roll with it in some areas, and embrace it in others, like the character roster.</p>
<p>All the main cast have been lavished with love, given multiple costume variants to find by driving through and using meal items when racing, and all the animations that you’d expect. Then there’s the sensation and delight of Cow being a playable character, having adorable little animations while jumping that have made her an immediate fan favourite. And then there’s the third tier, with characters that just… well, that just don’t make much sense. How can Sidestepper drive? This big-eyed crab just sits in a car with both claws up in the air, and just has feet dangling off the sides of a bike, with a kind of out of control horror in their eyes as they look out from the screen at you. And then Fish Bone, which can have even less contact between its fishy skeleton and your chosen vehicle. I love that they’re there, and they’re hilarious to see for the first time in the character select screen, but they also feel a bit like Nintendo kind of gave in to the concept, when they’re usually the ones in complete control.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is both a bold new direction for this series, and yet one that remains familiar. You can still just race around tracks if you wish and ignore the open world races, or you can race point-to-point races that you won’t see within the main Grand Prix or Knockout Tour mode. And there’s also Battle Mode, which has the usual mix of of bespoke arenas and repurposed track sections to race through. This is also a lot of fun in split-screen, and if you have the Switch 2 camera set up and everyone’s mug on screen to highlight your human rivals, the competitiveness that everyone feels when playing Mario Kart shines through.</p>
<p>We won’t have to wait too long before we see how all of this comes together. Mario Kart World is out in just two days alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s bound to be the first game that almost anyone that buys this console plays, maybe even the only game for the first first months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-it-be-worth-the-entry-fee/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, one thing that you cannot accuse Nintendo of is not finding inventive ways to explore all the hardware capabilities of their new generation console.</p>
<p>The game takes you to a gigantic museum of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, giving your tiny ant-like avatar all the different parts of the new console to explore and learn about. Starting from the left Joy-Con 2, skating across the slick touchscreen of the Switch 2 itself, and even descending down into the inner electronics, Nintendo illustrates what makes their console tick in a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour –&nbsp;The Final Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Pwh5e-v_Rw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Every feature has been explored in minute detail, whether it’s a new concept or something that’s also common to the Nintendo Switch and smartphones and tablets in general. So, you have the gyroscope within the body of the Switch tablet, and with the now fully adjustable kickstand (adapted from the Switch OLED to the Switch 2), that combines for a game where you try to set out angles as precisely as possible – turns out I’m damn good at knowing what a 30º, 45º and other angles look like. Or there’s a game of Twister for your fingers, where you have to try and put all ten of the digits on your hand on screen with randomised colour assignments.</p>
<p>Then there’s demos of HDR, pushing the maximum brightness of modern TV screens, of 120Hz refresh rates, or of HD Rumble and how it can replicate different feelings as you wave the Joy-Con 2 around. And every facet of the console’s hardware is detailed in informative pop-ups that, yes, you will be quizzed on later. Did you know that the Switch 2’s built-in speakers are the same modules as in the Switch OLED, but a mixture of tweaks to how they’re installed and software wizardry should make them sound better.</p>


<p>It’s an experience that taps into a very particular type of curiosity, saying that desire to know how things have been put together and what those features allow you to do, and that will speak to a particular kind of person. And if that concept gets you through the door, then there’s the allure of the high score chases, of earning medals to open up minigame variants and test yourself against those as well.</p>
<p>There’s a playfulness to even the simplest of ideas, such as when you play a level from Super Mario Bros. in 4K, but with pixels at 1:1 scale. You’ll see just how that entire level can fit onto a full 4K screen with room to spare, while dropping down a pipe to a sub-level does exactly what you’d expect and hope, slotting that screen down under the main stage. Simple, but joyful.</p>

<p>Yet through it all there is just that feeling that this could maybe have been a pack-in title. It’s obviously Nintendo’s choice whether they want to charge for this kind of experience, but this feels like an educational tool, almost. It’s something that parents can play through with their kids to learn about technology, making it clear that game consoles and phones aren’t filled with fairy dust, but have a different kind of magic making them work. And when that’s £8, I fear that it’s going to lose out to the immediacy of Mario Kart World or the countless other games that will come in the months and years that follow.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour might not be an essential purchase for the Switch 2’s launch, but it still has that glimmer of Nintendo magic that could be well worth exploring, and there’s the capacity for this to surprise us as we explore later areas and experiences. We look forward to playing more in the next few days.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 is now available, introducing many improvements that will aid developers in creating high-fidelity open worlds running at 60 frames per second on current generation hardware.</p>
<p>The new features of the latest version of the engine have been revealed during this year's edition of State of Unreal, and summarized in a video which showcases hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, revamped Tween Tools and redesigned Curve editor, procedural physics via the new Physics Control rig, MetaHuman creation tools now being embedded in the engine with brand-new features, simplified user interface and more, and smoother and more efficient GPU spawning at runtime.</p>

<p>A first in-game look at some of the Unreal Engine 5.6 features summarized in the video above was provided earlier today with the first-ever <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV gameplay</a>. While the footage may be a little lacking in terms of action, it does an excellent job showcasing some of the new technology CD Projekt Red is developing together with Epic that will make the game one of the most immersive open-world RPGs ever, such as Nanite Foliage, which allows the developer to create dense foliage without having a major impact on performance.</p>
<p>Additional information on Unreal Engine 5.6 can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tales-of-kenzera-developer-announces-new-horror-game-dead-take-coming-to-pc-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Surgent Studios, the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/">Tales of Kenzera: ZAU</a>, has announced its next project, a horror game called Dead Take.</p>
<p>Instead of working with EA again with Dead Take being another EA Originals project, Dead Take will be published by Pocketpair Publishing, and is due to arrive on just PC for now, sometime in 2025. It's unclear if there are plans to bring the game to consoles sometime later on.</p>
<p>The story of Dead Take sees you put into the shoes of an actor who begins to get "<em>uneasy</em>" per the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam page</a> when they can't get their friend on the phone. Dead Take seems to be all about the entertainment industry, going behind the "<em>glittering facade to expose its darkest secrets,</em>" according to a press release.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEAD TAKE | Teaser | Surgent Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_1dJASFBl3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All together, the teaser trailer and everything we've seen about Dead Take so far doesn't give us a lot to go on, but that's by design, according to chief executive officer and studio founder Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"<em>We're being secretive for a reason</em>," Salim said in a press release. "<em>The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'.</em>"</p>
<p>As a debut project for a new indie team, Tales of Kenzera: ZAU showed that Surgent Studios is a talented team that's capable of telling emotionally resonant stories in games. It's exciting to see them take on a horror project, and hopefully, Salim is right when he says it won't be too long before we get the chance to play it ourselves.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-showcased-state-of-unreal/">The Witcher IV trailer</a> was shared today, alongside impressive gameplay footage running on base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which was shown at the beginning of this year's State of Unreal presentation and can be watched below, is the first in-engine look at the next entry in the series by CD Projekt Red and sets the stage for the first impressive gameplay showcase which the development studio used to show some of the new technology that will power the game setting out to be the most ambitious entry in the series, and one that will bring open-world RPGs to the next generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - Cinematic Trailer | State of Unreal 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_aRhNcHryA?start=115&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The gameplay showcase features Ciri as she travels to a village in Kovir together with her horse Kelpie, allowing the developers to show multi-character motion matching for Ciri and Kelpie, machine learning deformation to realistic render the horse's muscle with limited impact on performance, as well as Nanite Foliage, which solved the issue of needing dense foliage without impacting performance and allowed the developers to surpass the LOD tricks that have been used so far. Once Ciri reaches the village, it becomes clear how immersive The Witcher IV's world will be, as everything will be massively responsive, and there will sometimes be chain reactions between different elements. At the end of the showcase, we also got the first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir. The gameplay showcase can be checked out below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersPrey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamersPrey</a>.</p>

<p>The Witcher IV will not launch until 2027 at the earliest. A precise release window has yet to be confirmed.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Every few moments in the current build of arcade space shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nova-drift">Nova Drift</a> there's a chance the game will spawn a Cargo Train. Whenever the game decides to spawn a Cargo Train, there's a 1/7777 chance it will spawn a Space Whale instead. "Nonsense," you bellow. "Space Whales are a myth. Designer Jeffrey Nielson has been telling us they're not real ever since the original Kickstarter in 2017." Ah, you poor, unsuspecting mooncalf. You chirpy little starfish. Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide treacherously hidden inside downloadable software packages. Nielson has been telling you porkies.</p>
<p>He did, in fact, surreptitiously add a Space Whale to the game shortly before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arcade-shooter-nova-drift-is-a-petri-dish-in-which-to-spawn-the-daftest-deadliest-spaceship">Nova Drift's 1.0 release back in August 2024</a>, after years of conspiracy theories. This, friends, is the good kind of lie, the kind of lie that makes combing through a million changelogs for potential headlines worthwhile.</p><!--more-->
<p>Nielson has posted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/858210/view/536603447519086520?l=english">a full account of the running gag on Steam</a>, beginning with the first Discord "space whale" gags back in 2017. With speculation at fever-pitch, he started baiting the whale-watchers with mock community rules insisting that Space Whales aren't real. Finally, he created a "Miniature Space Whale" companion as an April Fool's joke in 2023. </p>
<p>Said Miniature Space Whale update was heavily positioned as a wind-up with arch allusions to predatory monetisation mechanisms, aka "pay-to-win-dark-patterns-bullshit", but some players took it seriously regardless. The Whale had, by this point, navigated the twisting currents of Ironic Process Theory and coasted into the balmy latitudes of the Streisand Effect. It <em>had</em> to become real. It had to have <em>always already</em> been real.</p>
<p>So Nielson sneakily began breeding a Space Whale. "I started work on this shortly after, but it got sidetracked, so the assets were in the game for a while before I actually made it possible for the whale to spawn in game," he writes in the post.</p>
<p>Having the assets in-game obviously meant that players could discover them. But Nielson foresaw this possibility, and eventually made it part of the fable.</p>
<p>"Knowing that my players love to data mine, I gave the files confusing names as an attempt at plausible deniability, but it was not enough," he goes on. "Players used the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a> mod tools to rip the sprites and then assemble them into something approximating a whale, but I expected this. I claimed that putting them in the engine was the easiest way for me to spoof that April Fool's day shot. But mostly I tried to stay out of the conversation. I'd muddied the waters enough that, with the help of the other community members, people weren't sure what was true anymore. Perfect."</p>
<p>Good heavens! What a magnificent bastard.</p>
<p>If you encounter the whale in Nova Drift, you'll find it to be non-hostile and "almost indestructible". It's a real boon for early-game players, steadily emitting XP orbs while in motion. If that sounds like it's going to wreck the balance, rest easy in the knowledge that the odds of spawning mean you'll probably only ever encounter a whale every few hundred hours.</p>
<p>"My plan was that it'd be just rare enough that players couldn't be sure whether evidence was doctored," Nielson adds. "After all, the art had existed in the game files quite a while before anyone captured it in a screen shot. This was of course unsustainable as video evidence did eventually appear, but by the time it did, we were way past the truth mattering. I'd just claim the video wasn't playing or that Discord was busted. Or I'd just act really impressed at their forgery skill." </p>
<p>I guess it's possible that there are still no Space Whales in the game and that this Steam blog is a continuation of the conspiracy. Still, fun story! Let's see if we're still laughing as and when Nielson goes into politics. Just think: if he joined some sleazy electoral social engineering firm, I could write about it and deploy the only other Moby Dick joke I can think of here, "call me Phishmael".</p>
<p>I like when developers tell fibs to their players, providing it's stuff like this rather than lying to you about data collection, or deleting half the workforce from the credits. It makes the "live service" thing feel almost playful, rather than a glassy-eyed eternity of intravenous content attrition. Besides which, all of these shenanigans will ultimately operate to the benefit of living, non-digital whales. Nielson is apologising for "gaslighting" his players by donating 20% of the game's sales to the WDC Whale and Dolphin Conservation charity as part of <a href="https://games.whales.org/world-ocean-day-festival-2025/">World Ocean Day Festival 2025</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > CD Projekt RED [203 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a> has <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1778/cd-projekt-red-and-epic-games-present-the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-tech-demo-at-the-state-of-unreal-2025" target="_blank">released</a> a new cinematic trailer and technical demonstration of <em><a title="Games > The Witcher IV [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher IV</a></em> as part of State of Unreal 2025. The technical demonstration is running on a base <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,578 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> at 60 frames per second with ray-tracing. <span id="more-969180"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>As Unreal Fest 2025 kicked off, CD Projekt RED joined <a title="Companies > Epic Games [349 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> on stage to present a tech demo of <em>The Witcher IV</em> in Unreal Engine 5. Presented in typical CD Projekt RED style, the tech demo follows the main protagonist Ciri in the midst of a monster contract and shows off some of the innovative Unreal Engine 5 technology and features that will power the game’s open world.</p><p>The tech demo takes place in the region of Kovir—which will make its very first appearance in the video game series in <em>The Witcher IV</em>. The presentation followed main protagonist Ciri—along with her horse Kelpie—as she made her way through the rugged mountains and dense forests of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. Along the way, CD PROJEKT RED and Epic Games dove deep into how each feature is helping drive performance, visual fidelity, and shape <em>The Witcher IV</em>‘s immersive open world.</p><p> Watch the full presentation from Unreal Fest 2025 now at LINK.</p><p>Since the strategic partnership was announced in 2022, CDPR has been working with Epic Games to develop new tools and enhance existing features in Unreal Engine 5 to expand the engine’s open-world development capabilities and establish robust tools geared toward CD PROJEKT RED’s open-world design philosophies. The demo, which runs on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second, shows off in-engine capabilities set in the world of <em>The Witcher IV</em>, including the new Unreal Animation Framework, Nanite Foliage rendering, MetaHuman technology with Mass AI crowd scaling, and more. The tools showcased are being developed, tested, and eventually released to all UE developers, starting with today’s Unreal Engine 5.6 release. This will help other studios create believable and immersive open-world environments that deliver performance at 60 FPS without compromising on quality—even at vast scales. While the presentation was running on a PlayStation console, the features and technology will be supported across all platforms the game will launch on.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Unreal Animation Framework powers realistic character movements in busy scenes. FastGeo Streaming, developed in collaboration with Epic Games, allows environments to load quickly and smoothly. Nanite Foliage fills forests and fields with dense detail without sacrificing performance. The Mass system handles large, dynamic crowds with ease, while ML Deformer adds subtle, realistic touches to character animation—right down to muscle movement.</p></blockquote><p>“We started our partnership with Epic Games to push <a title="Genres > Open-World [644 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> technology forward,” said CD Projekt RED joint CEO Michal Nowakowski in a press release. “To show this early look at the work we’ve been doing using Unreal Engine running at 60 [frames per second] on PlayStation 5, is a significant milestone—and a testament of the great cooperation between our teams. But we’re far from finished. I look forward to seeing more advancements and inspiring technology from this partnership as development of <em>The Witcher IV</em> on Unreal Engine 5 continues.”</p><p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney added, “CD Projekt RED is one of the industry’s best open-world game studios, and we’re grateful that they’re working with us to push Unreal Engine forward with <em>The Witcher IV</em>. They are the perfect partner to help us develop new world-building features that we can share with all Unreal Engine developers.”</p><p><em>The Witcher IV</em> will be available for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,276 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has revealed its next game, which will be published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>'s Pocketpair.</p>
<p>In a change of tone, Dead Take is a horror game about "power and corruption in the entertainment industry", and promises to have a star-studded cast, though few details are yet known.</p>
<p>"We're being secretive for a reason," said Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios. "The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'."</p>

<p>A teaser trailer (see above) has been released for the first-person psychological horror game, though it's all quite abstract for now.</p>
<p>Dead Take is set for release later this year, on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Surgent and Pocketpair revealed their new partnership</a> on what was then an unknown horror game. Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing following its success with Palworld.</p>
<p>Dead Take isn't the only game Surgent is working on, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">The studio also has Project Uso</a> (the Swahili word for 'face'), which will be an Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG.</p>
<p>Both games will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, a metroidvania released last year with a distinct setting based on African folklore and exploring themes of grief. The game recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the Game Beyond Entertainment award at this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>PlayStation has announced a new State of Play event for tomorrow, June 4, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT / 11pm CEST, that will be more than 40 minutes long and feature "<em>news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe</em>."</p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">PlayStation Blog</a>, as these kinds of events always are now, with nothing more than the short description quoted above to give a very opaque, general idea as to what players will see at the show.</p>
<p>It's the first big game-announcements-focused show of the week ahead of the big Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off show, which technically makes it the real kick-off event of this announcements-driven week that we're about to have.</p>

<p>As far as what we'll see, the news of this showcase makes the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9 reveal rumors</a> feel all the more possible, as we've previously seen major Resident Evil games, like Resident Evil Village, get their reveal during a PlayStation event.&nbsp;Another game to look out for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, which is still without a release date, but is due to get a release date soon after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/"> gameplay trailer we saw earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Also, it's a State of Play event, which doesn't always feature first-party PlayStation games, but it wouldn't be too outlandish to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">Ghost of Yotei</a> once more, or even just the news that a specialized Ghost of Yotei event is coming ahead of that game's launch in October. We'll have to see what tomorrow holds.</p>

There’s likely going to be a lot of news from the show; the company’s Unreal Engine is used as part of making many of the world’s biggest video games and entertainment, and <em>Fortnite</em> is still a huge game that’s getting new experiences all the time thanks to the Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</p><p>At the show, Epic will be hosting its annual State of Unreal keynote, which will begin at 9:30AM ET on June 3rd. The company hasn’t said much about what will be announced, but it’s promising that it will “share what’s next for Unreal Engine and the Epic ecosystem.”</p><p>The show also follows the major ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blew up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">Apple’s control of the App Store</a>, and it seems likely that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney might have something to say about it.</p><p>Here’s our coverage from the event.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc4NDAz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678403/epic-games-metahumans-unreal-engine">Epic is making it easier to create MetaHumans</a></h2><div><p>Epic Games’ hyperrealistic MetaHuman characters are seriously impressive, and now the company is making it easier for developers to incorporate them into their projects. At its State of Unreal show on Tuesday, Epic announced that the MetaHuman Creator is now embedded within Unreal Engine as part of Unreal Engine 5.6.</p><p>The company is also bringing its face-authoring tools for MetaHumans’ faces to bodies, meaning developers will be able to create faces and bodies with fine-tuned parameters for their games or applications. Developers will be able to sell their MetaHumans on Epic’s Fab marketplace for digital assets, too, so they can be used in other games or projects.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678403/epic-games-metahumans-unreal-engine">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Engine updates.</p><p>A big part of the presentation is showing off the latest developments with Unreal Engine 5, and Epic crammed all of those details, including animation improvements and more impressive open worlds, into this short video.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc4NDYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Epic showed off Unreal Engine 5 with an impressive Witcher 4 tech demo</a></h2><div><p>An ongoing tradition at Epic’s big keynotes is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273832/epic-unreal-engine-demo-troll-rebirth-ray-tracing-gdc-2019">gorgeous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date">tech demo </a>that shows off what its game engine is capable of. For this year’s State of Unreal, the company turned to <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. This new demo a beautiful glimpse at its fantasy world, filled with blood, fire, and monsters — and more importantly, a new horse.</p><p>The demo was built using Unreal Engine 5.6, and shows new protagonist Ciri exploring some forested lands and a marketplace known as Valdrest. Epic says the demo is designed in part to show off how the latest iteration can handle both bustling scenes and foliage in an open-world setting. It also shows how much horse technology has improved since <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Epic says that the demo is running on a base model PS5 at 60 frames per second, with raytracing enabled, and the presentation included a live demonstration, with the developers playing the game on stage. You can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjikvaR0i34">the full keynote here</a>, just scroll back to the beginning to watch the <em>Witcher 4</em> segment.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A Ciri-ously good start.</p><p>Things kicked off with a beautiful tech demo for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.

            <p>Good news, people who've been struggling to form the perfect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> trifecta and don't fancy taking on the task of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-update-fixes-a-graphics-problem-and-makes-the-rpg-easier-in-single-player">battering Nightlords solo</a>. FromSoft have now confirmed that duo expeditions will be coming to the game later this year, as part of post-launch plans which also include "enhanced" fights against existing bosses.</p>
<p>"The Night is far from over," the studio <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">tweeted today</a> as it celebrated 3.5 million players having hopped in so far, "In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support."</p>
<p>So, no concrete dates yet, but at least you know that duos-centric post-launch support the game's director had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">previously hinted at</a> has now been locked in, alongside some other goodies. I mean, you can't really go wrong giving Fromsoft lovers another excuse to batter some big baddies, even if they've battered said baddies before.</p>
<p>Until these additions start to drop, those on PC do have the option of using mods to play as a terrifying twosome, with Seamless Co-Op maestro Yui having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">whipped out a duos mod</a> quicker than the average <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> attack.</p>
<p>Fromsoft may have chosen to focus on trios and lone fighters, but the people demand the chance to propose Nightreign as a date night option without having to link up with a third wheel. We'll see how those relationships fare if the studio opts to ratchet the difficulty up for duos, creating a test even tougher than having the in-laws over for tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a>. Go on, you know you want to.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A console powerful enough for big cinematic games but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata-san before the launch but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day.”</p><p>Iwata passed away after more than a decade as the head of Nintendo in July 2015 from cancer, just two years prior to the launch of the original Switch. NES <em>Golf</em>, one of the first games he ever worked on, was hidden in the original hardware as a tribute to the executive and developer that would only unlock when the console date <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-is-still-oddly-tight-lipped-about-the-switch-s-1820050815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-is-still-oddly-tight-lipped-about-the-switch-s-1820050815">was set to the day of his death</a></span>. Nintendo has been tight-lipped about that easter egg, and rarely reflects on its own legacy and the people who created it in a public setting, making Huang’s mention even more striking. </p><p>The Switch 2, like its predecessor, runs on a custom Nvidia chip. While the tech last time around was repurposed from smartphones, the processing unit this time around appears to cater much more closely to the needs of a gaming machine, with the inclusion of DLSS, variable refresh rate, and other processing techniques aimed at boosting performance and visual clarity even on moderate specs. “Switch 2 is more than a new console, it’s a new chapter worthy of Iwata-san’s vision,” Huang said. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Elden Ring developer From Software has announced that Nightreign will indeed add two-player co-op following the studio's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">admission about overlooking this in development</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, From Software said it will add "Duo Expeditions" sometime down the road. On the more immediate horizon is the introduction of "enhanced fights with existing Nightlords" beginning this month. The developer did not provide any specifics on what it meant by "enhanced."</p><p>Nightreign is also getting unspecified DLC in the future as part of the game's ongoing support.</p><p>As for why Nightreign launched without two-player co-op, game director Junya Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the studio "overlooked" this possibility during development. "So we're very sorry about that," he said.</p><p>Ishizaki explained that Nightreign is balanced for people to play solo or with groups of three.
