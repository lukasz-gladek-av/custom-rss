<p>Ironmouse, arguably the most recognisable VTuber in the world, has just smashed the all-time high Twitch subscriber record, breezing past the likes of Kai Cenat to make history. This achievement comes days after Ironmouse’s YouTube channel was taken offline because it was affiliated with another channel that was previously banned.</p>



<p>These are the loftiest heights ever reached by a VTuber, which just goes to prove that you don’t need a face to be famous.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-set-in-stone">Set in Stone</h2>



<p>Kai Cenat has already spoken about hosting another massive subathon to reclaim his crown on Twitch — and he’ll probably do it, too. Ironmouse surpassing the record is something special, though. In recent years, the concept of the VTuber has exploded, and almost every popular game on Twitch and YouTube has representation from that community.</p>



<p>Typically, VTubers will use intelligent software to track their movements and translate them into an animated persona, while others will rely on an animated avatar that moves around using pre-programmed actions. Ironmouse is at the top of the table in the VTuber world – less than a year ago, she won the Creator of the Year Award at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>When the milestone was hit, Ironmouse issued an emotional thank-you to her community:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you guys so much; thank you all very, very much. Thank you for being my community and thank you for being my rock and thank you for giving me back my life and thank you for helping me and people out there like me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the controversial and downright irritating creator, Adin Ross, had to spew bile about the achievement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What the f*** am I looking at? Can somebody give me hte context behind this? I saw this picture earlier, I thought it was some kind of meme. Anyone that’s role-playing as this is a f***ing grown man, or has a bitch working in some type of basement. What the f*** am I looking at, dude? </p>



<p>How did she surpass Kai in this s***? How is this possible? </p>
</blockquote>



<p>He changed his tune when he learned that the subathon was in representation of a charity, but not before his chat warned him that he was in danger of being cancelled yet again.</p>

<p>Haliey ‘Hawk Tuah’ Welch is attending DreamHack Atlanta for a meet and greet session, thanks to Kick.com. Nobody is really sure why, but ticket holders will be able to meet the social media sensation who rose to fame after going viral in a video wherein she detailed what ‘drives a man crazy in bed’.</p>



<p>You can’t see me right now, but I have the flattest expression imaginable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-okay">Okay</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the DreamHack team revealed that Haliey Welch will be attending DH Atlanta on October 5 at 16:30 EST. While she’s there, she’ll be performing a meet and greet event and promoting Paws Across America, possibly the only good thing to come out of her rise to fame.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Paws Across America is Welch’s foundation that seeks to bring ‘awareness’ to animal-focused charities across the United States.</p>



<p>Recently, Welch proved herself a gamer by talking at length about Red Dead Redemption 2, but the connection that’s linking her to DreamHack Atlanta, one of the premiere esports events in the annual calendar, is thin at best.</p>



<p>Many have shrugged their shoulders and signed this behaviour off as par for the course for Kick.com, which has built a presence based on the viral nature of controversial creators and ‘celebrities’ with questionable premises. This event will also serve as a promotional stunt for Welch’s ‘Talk Tuah’ podcast, which has become one of the most popular shows in North America.</p>



<p>We were hoping that Welch’s fame would subside pretty quickly, but people seem intent on keeping her at the top of the table. This all comes from a ten-second clip that aired on platforms like TikTok showing Welch describing her fellatio tactics, so do with that information what you will.</p>

		<p>The PlayStation Network is suffering a major server outage, knocking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PS4 gamers offline overnight, and with no indication from Sony of when and how this will be resolved.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://status.playstation.com/">PSN Service Status page</a> shows the breadth of the problem for PlayStation gamers, with account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video and the PlayStation Store all affected – PlayStation Direct is fine, though. Issues affect all platforms – “Other, PS Vita, PS3, PS4, PS5, Web” – and started at 2:21AM BST.</p>


<p>For the all-important gaming tab, it notes that “You might have difficulty launching games, apps or network features. We’re working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.”</p>

<p>Thankfully for gamers in Europe, we’ve been able to sleep through all of this, and most won’t get to play during work and school hours, however, 2:21AM for us is 9:21PM on the US East Coast, taking out online gaming for a whole evening in America.</p>

<p>Of course, you should still be able to play offline games, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, but if you wanted to hop into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>, for example, then you could have issues. If a game is in need of an update before launching, this could also throw an error WS-116522-7 – noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258989/ps5-ps4-playstation-network-down-outage-offline">The Verge</a> – or games that need to authenticate while launching can end up hanging on their opening splash screen. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7,</a> for example, throws a “Something went wrong.” with code E2-CE210610.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-tgs-news-congalala-kut-ku-newest-revealed-returning-monster-is-a-farting-pink-ape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, more Monster Hunter reveals out of Tokyo Game Show.</h2></div><section><p>We learned a lot of new information about Monster Hunter Wilds at Tokyo Game Show 2024 during the Capcom Online Program and extended Scarlet Forest gameplay stream, including the reveal of the foul Congala and fowl Yian Kut-Ku. Both monsters are returning to the series after a long absence. Here’s a quick breakdown of everything we’ve learned with comments from the developers.</p><h3><strong>The Fanged Beast Congalala, a Farting Pink Ape</strong></h3><p>Technically, we could’ve made an educated guess that Congalala would be returning to the series thanks to the distinctly pink armor the hunter was wearing in the official Dual Blades showcase. But it was finally officially confirmed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ3L0-Q5tHw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlet Forest gameplay stream</a>, where the developers said fans have wanted Congalala to return for quite some time. Congalala is a Fanged Beast first introduced in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 for PSP (at least in the US). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/congalala-monster-hunter-wilds-1727741278022.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Congalala resembles a gorilla, except it has striking pink fur and a tail that’s often holding a mushroom. Its main, disgusting way of attacking is through visible farts that throw brown debris into the air and belches that change depending on the food it most recently ate. In Wilds, before a certain move, Congalala will produce a special item called “Truffle de Conga” which can be stolen and used in your own cooking. </p><p>Congalala can also cover you in a “stench” so powerful you’re unable to consume anything, including health potions. Make sure to bring Deodorant out on hunts in the Scarlet Forest which is where you’ll encounter Congalala, at least for the first time. Luckily, recovering from such a stench is simple with Monster Hunter Wilds’ new <strong>Optimal Status Recovery option in the radial menu</strong>. With this, you’ll have quick access to whatever item is needed at the moment, so you won’t have to dig through the item pouch while it’s too stinky to think. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In an interview with IGN, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda says this new feature is meant to be a quality of life improvement, but you may not find yourself using it as often as you think because the Palico will be “on it” trying to heal you. The same can be said about the <strong>Optimal Health Recovery option</strong>, which will not only use guild-issued healing items like Rations before dipping into your hard-earned stores of Potions but will use the item that will get you closest to full recovery without overdoing it. </p><h3><strong>The Bird Wyvern Yian Kut-Ku, the Original “Tutorial Monster”</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/mh-wilds-yian-kut-ku-1727741328709.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Yian Kut-Ku is the very first flying monster Hunters faced in the original Monster Hunter for PS2, and has the honor of being the first returning monster to be revealed after Rathalos.</p><p>Like Congalala, Yian Kut-Ku is also pink, and resembles a goofy-looking, scaly bird monster. While Yian Kut-Ku moves around a lot and is fairly quick, it usually trips and falls when it charges. Kut-Ku’s other main attack is fireballs, making it an early resource for Flame Sacs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Monster Hunter Wilds executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka says Yian Kut-Ku was given the honored spot of first properly revealed returning monster afer Rathalos not just because they love Yian Kut-Ku, but because he thinks it’s “a sort-of well-known, popular, and beloved monster among the fan base.” Fujioka adds, “This choice of the next reveal was something that I think showed that we love Monster Hunter just as much as you guys do, and we’re always thinking about what would be fun to bring back.” </p><p>As for why Yian Kut-Ku is being brought back for Wilds specifically, Fujioka says it would be great to see how Yian Kut-Ku appears in Wilds' pack system, where the same large monsters can appear in a group for the first time. </p><h3><strong>Customizable Seikrets</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/screenshot-2024-09-30-at-8-24-13-pm-1727742286280.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Screenshot from the TGS Capcom Live Stream</figcaption></figure></output><p>During the Scarlet Forest gameplay, we also saw the hunter riding a differently colored Seikret. The Seikret is the mount in Monster Hunter Wilds, and it was confirmed during this stream that we can customize its colors. Not much else is known about the depth of this customizability just yet! </p><p>Alongside the two monster reveals, the Scarlet Forest gameplay stream also showed a portion of a hunt with Uth Una, the Leviathan revealed during the most recent PlayStation State of Play. There were also details on how fishing in Monster Hunter Wilds will be a little more involved when reeling in a big fish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Lastly, though unrelated to Monster Hunter Wilds specifically, there were more announcements for Monster Hunter’s 20th Anniversary, including a special Rathalos Fender Telecaster guitar. Capcom also revealed that Monster Hunter is getting special collaborations with both Transformers and Digimon. For Transformers, a Rathalos Prime Transformer figure; and for Digimon, two special V-Pets featuring  monsters from Monster Hunter as well as special fusion monsters. RathalosGremon is a fusion of Greymon and Rathalos, and ZinoGarurumon a fusion of Garurumon and Zinogre. As of now, we’re unsure if these will be officially available outside of Japan.  </p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 18, 2025 simultaneously for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

		<p>I love this time of year. I kicked it off by watching the extremely weird horror movie <em>Demon Seed</em> over the weekend. It's always good when you can find a movie that makes you go "oh god, why did they do <em>that</em>?" You can spend decades mining a single genre and still find surprises, however horrifying! That's the good stuff.</p><p>-pk, who may show up on a <em>Nextlander </em>podcast later this week, too</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I recorded Sports!, which you should hear tomorrow. We're getting into a rhythm of recoding subscriber-only podcasts a week in advance, but with Sports!, we want to react in the moment, which throws off that cadence a bit. It's mostly a Bears-focused discussion this week, though obviously in the larger context of being sad about a team being bad. The next episode should be about the NFL season generally, plus the WNBA playoffs. I also spent a chunk of today preparing my Shocktober 2024 list of movies!!!</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> If all goes right, I'll click publish on my Shocktober list in the morning, a mixture of new/old movies that can guide your horror watching this month! In the afternoon, we'll be returning to <em>Space Marine 2</em> as a squad.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>Another scheduling change is recording Remap Radio in the mornings on Wednesdays, because we want Remap Radio to start arriving fresh in your feeds on Friday morning, as soon as you wake up! This should mean we're delivering you podcasts at the start and end of the week with a much more regular cadence. This has taken some working behind-the-scenes and it's not the sexist change in the world, but I hope you enjoy the results.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Sadly, our GeForce NOW streams are over. (Chances are they'll be back again later in the year, though.) But we are returning to The Wheel of UFO 50, which was such a blast with Cado and Janet last week that we gotta do it again. Also, as a special Halloween treat, I'm going to be doing weekly spooky streams on (probably) Thursday evenings. When I start these streams, though, depends on when my children fall asleep. There's also a chance I do them on a different night, so just stay tuned to our social feeds for more information them.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Beyond a Rob/Patrick letter series that has yet to be determined, you'll have Remap Radio hot 'n fresh. There's a chance we sneak in an extra stream, but that depends on a few scheduling things working out. Otherwise, the weekend (and drinking beer and watching horror movies) approaches! This is also normally where we'd have the next <em>Volgarr the Viking </em>stream, but the ol' scheduling issues means that we'll have to revisit that again later in October.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

                <p>The second mission in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-starfield-shattered-space-dlc/2900-5808/" data-ref-id="2900-5808">Starfield Shattered Space</a> is called The Promised, Broken. During this mission, you enter the sacred city of Dazra on the planet of Va'ruun'kai after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-shattered-space-what-remains-full-quest-walkthrough/2900-5810/" data-ref-id="2900-5810">making your way through The Oracle</a>. After gaining admittance to the city thanks to hearing the words of Anasko Va'ruun, you head up to walk the Serpent's Path with Inaza Kaisir. Here, you learn some of the backstory of House Va'ruun and what led to the house's creation. However, at the end of the path, you have to make a choice and pick between four Effigies to honor the house.</p><p>Below, you can see which Effigies to select and if they even make a difference in Starfield.</p><h2>How to walk the Serpent's Path in Starfield</h2><p>Before you can reach the Effigy selection in Starfield, you need to successfully walk the entirety of the Serpent's Path. This isn't too difficult, but you are offered some additional choices along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376364-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.04.52.08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376364" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376364-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.04.52.08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376364"></a><figcaption>The entrance to the Serpent's Path in Dazra</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376364-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.04.52.08.png"></figure><p>After entering the Serpent's Path, Inaza Kaisir speaks to you. They go over a brief history of House Va'ruun and how its founder came to know the house's god, the Great Serpent. Along the path you stop at various checkpoints where you're offered a choice to prove your dedication to the Great Serpent.</p><p>The first checkpoint is a candle-lit memorial that details how the first followers of House Va'ruun came to be. Here, you can blow out a candle and continue on with the path. Blowing out the candle, and every subsequent choice, is optional.</p><p>The second checkpoint allows you to unburden yourself by tossing one of your possessions into a lit brazier next to another memorial. You can easily toss in a junk item to the brazier or simply leave it without unburdening yourself at all.</p><p>The third checkpoint allows you to take a leap of faith across a gap with a waterfall. The leap of faith is the easiest checkpoint to pass, as all you need to do is jump one time. However, if you truly don't want to make the leap, turn right from the memorial and take the metal stairs around the gap.</p><p>Finally, the fourth and fifth checkpoints are right next to each other. The fourth checkpoint offers you the chance to step into poisoned water right beneath a memorial, which doesn't harm you too badly and the poison status effect goes away shortly. Then, the fifth checkpoint is the most brutal, as you have to choose between sacrificing a Groat, a small rodent-like creature, or letting it live. If you sacrifice the Groat, you'll further prove your loyalty to House Va'ruun. However, you can let it live if you want by simply advancing past the Groat's area.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376365" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376365"></a><figcaption>Choosing to sacrifice the Groat in the Serpent's Path</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4376365-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.09.30-13.09.28.78.png"></figure><h2>What Effigy should you pick in Starfield?</h2><p>At long last, you'll eventually arrive at the spot where you can select an Effigy.

			<p>To many, it comes as no surprise that Star Wars Outlaws has only sold 1 million copies since it launched. This game was set to be Ubisoft's biggest game, as this is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">the game that they funneled the most time and money into</a>, but it has been a huge detriment to Ubisoft and has led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">Ubisoft's share prices dropping to a stark low</a>. While some gamers have enjoyed this game, it has received a bunch of low scores and, as a result, has only sold a million in the month of its release. As a result of the failure of Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has taken this as an opportunity to turn it into a learning curve for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of money Ubisoft funneled into this game; they were shocked at how poorly the general audience received it. Before the game was even released, Ubisoft revealed details of their<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/"> Season Pass roadmap</a> for Star Wars Outlaws, which, as a whole, is quite a predatory move, as only those who own it would get access to new quests and a story to complete. Upon release, the Director of Star Wars Outlaws also expressed his surprise about <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">the Metacritic score</a>, despite the score at that point not being bad and received a 76, giving it the Generally Favorable status.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has commented that the game's performance proved 'softer than expected,' and it's possible that this is why Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed. Since the announcement of Assassin's Creed Shadows, the game has been nothing but controversial. Some were outraged by the inaccuracy of the story in the game, as well as people from Japan urged Ubisoft to either cancel the game or reshape it due to the problematic merchandise they revealed. The merchandise was of the protagonist of the game standing on a one-legged Torii gate, of which there is only one in the entirety of Japan. This particular Torii gate is a huge piece of Japan's history, as it is a reminder of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Before the Tokyo Game Show started,<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/"> Ubisoft quickly announced its self-removal</a> from the exhibition and the cancelation of the live stream. They then announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, with the game's release date being moved to February 14, 2025. The company has claimed that the delay comes after "the learning from the Star Wars Outlaws release," as developers continued to push for a delay, but was consistently ignored by those at the top.</p>
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sources have claimed</a> that the team has taken the criticism on board and is now working to address the historical and cultural concerns, which started during external playtests as well as mass feedback after the initial reveal. Yasuke's story is now being tweaked, as well as his portrayal in the game and architectural fixes. According to sources, historical experts were hired very late into the development process of Assassin's Creed Shadows, and this led to a lot of miscommunication between teams.</p>
<p>Although the game is causing uproar among fans of the franchise, the number of pre-orders is said to be solid and will continue to rise now that it has been announced to be available on Steam from the start.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ironmouse-twitch-subscriber-record-kai-cenat-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every couple of years, somebody breaks Twitch’s all-time paid subscriber record. Ludwig Ahgren, now mostly on YouTube, showed the world how it's done <a href="https://kotaku.com/ludwigs-never-ending-twitch-stream-has-ended-1846682912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2021</a>, running a subathon – short for subscription marathon – in which additional subscriptions added time to a clock. He remained live for 31 days and racked up over 280,000 subscriptions. Kai Cenat, Twitch’s biggest mainstream success story of the past few years, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64811710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed a similar formula last year</a> and moved the needle just a hair past 306,000. Today they both got beat by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pink-haired anime girl</a>.</p><p>After 30 days of continuous streaming, one of the most popular vtubers in the world, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironmouse</a>, just broke Cenat’s record, with her sub count sitting at 313,000 as of this publishing. After a certain point, these numbers become immaterial – Twitch’s subscription system is extremely game-able and does not paint a <em>complete </em>picture of popularity, money-making potential, or anything, really –&nbsp; but the circumstances surrounding this one are what make it interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there’s Ironmouse herself. She’s a superstar these days, but her rise to prominence was far from probable. The person behind the bubbly-looking anime avatar suffers from a chronic illness called common variable immune deficiency, or CVID, which leaves her highly susceptible to infection, as well as a lung condition. She can barely go outside and, to this day, only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GVhxUX5ffE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“attends” IRL events</a> by way of a remote-controlled robot with a screen and a camera attached. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/04/20/twitch-ironmouse-vtuber-subathon-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Her first subathon</a>, which took place in 2022, helped put her on the map in part because there was no guarantee that she could last a full month, or even more than a handful of days. Against all odds, she pulled it off. It’s not an understatement to say that becoming a vtuber changed Ironmouse’s life; once isolated and bedridden, she now has community and the necessary funds to seek sufficient care for her own health.&nbsp;</p><p>If the story ended there, it would be yet another example of Western media trying to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56910392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make a heartwarming story out of tragic systemic failure</a>, but Ironmouse is at least attempting to do something with her star power: half the money raised during the current subathon will be donated to the IDF – no, no, not the bad one! In this case, that regrettable acronym stands for <a href="https://primaryimmune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immune Deficiency Foundation</a>, an organization for which Ironmouse and other streamers who support her have raised a staggering amount of money over the years.</p><p>So it’s for a good cause, but why here and now? This is where the game-ability of Twitch’s subscription system enters the equation. Every September, Twitch hosts an event called Subtember, in which it discounts the price of subscriptions to all streamers. This year, that actually meant basically bringing subscription prices back down to what used to be standard price after a platform-wide <a href="https://gamerant.com/twitch-price-increase-tier-1-subscription-35-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase earlier this year</a>, but a deal’s a deal. Even the human mind’s sturdiest defenses wither in the face of “25 percent off.”&nbsp;</p><p>This year, however, there’s a twist: For the final five days of Subtember, Twitch is also offering bonus gift subscriptions, meaning that if a viewer uses Twitch’s gift subscription functionality to purchase five subscriptions for other viewers in chat, Twitch will sweeten the pot with a bonus subscription. But the reality of the situation contradicts <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/subtember-2024-faq?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch’s own FAQ on the matter</a>. What seems to actually happen is that Twitch throws in <em>at least </em>one additional subscription per five – sometimes <a href="https://x.com/SailorPeachh/status/1839401008101048555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many more</a>. </p><p>Viewers have likened it to a gacha game; you put in a few subs, and you – or rather, everyone else in chat – might hit the jackpot. At this point, Twitch has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualYoutubers/comments/1fryn4u/comment/lpja4j4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributed thousands</a> to Ironmouse’s total number. In line with <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other elements of the current Twitch regime</a>, it’s at least savvy marketing. A company otherwise so strapped for cash that it’s been forced to lay off <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 1,000 employees</a> is nonetheless helping a beloved streamer donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to a good cause.</p><p>While, again, the number means less than what Ironmouse is planning to do with it, that hasn’t stopped some around the Twitch community from taking issue with how she came by it. Fans of Cenat, the previous record holder, have voiced bewilderment at the idea that so many people are “<a href="https://x.com/yoxics/status/1838420025931432135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subbing to a fictional character on a screen</a>,” neglecting to understand that there is a real person behind the fictional character and, indeed, that real person’s story is an enormous part of Ironmouse’s appeal. As a result, recent discourse around Ironmouse’s record has focused on a perceived battle between fan factions – between weebs and normies, two groups not nearly so well represented on Twitch until the titans that are Ironmouse and Cenat came along.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on an admittedly cursory survey of the damage, it seems like perhaps there’s been more conversation about people objecting to Ironmouse’s big moment than actual people objecting, but these sorts of divisions are not unprecedented. During Ironmouse’s first subathon in 2022, a landmark moment for vtubers, some of the more toxic elements of Twitch’s community suggested that vtubers were playing on easy mode, that not using their real appearances somehow gave them an unfair advantage over regular streamers. However, as Ironmouse and a growing army of vtubers large and small have shown us, vtubing is extremely fertile soil for high-effort innovation. Unshackled from the bonds of physical reality, they can <a href="https://aftermath.site/shindigs-vtuber-twitch-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create games within games and blur the lines between the real and digital worlds</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Other big-name streamers, including Ahgren, have thrown their support behind Ironmouse.&nbsp;</p><p>“She's a great streamer, has one of the best stories on Twitch, and is also donating half the money raised to charity,” he <a href="https://x.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1840813338122732018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “GO IRONMOUSE!!!!”</p><p>Cenat, ever the showman, has taken to playing up more of a rivalry angle, <a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1840836631479402767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledging that the record was broken</a> but <a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1840836709228978252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggesting</a> that he’s gonna break it again.</p><p>In reality, both Ironmouse and Cenat are intensely creative; it would be hard to argue that either deserves to hold the record more than the other. Cenat does Big And Loud better than anybody, turning marathon runs through popular games into bonafide events. Even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xQbW_aJ1XY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trailer for his <em>Elden Ring</em> playthrough</a> oozed ambition. Bringing in <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-kai-cenat-therapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a “therapist” to counsel him through the expansion</a> was meta icing atop an already solid sundae. Ironmouse, meanwhile, has a backstory and lore, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdfW1wk8S4o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious singing chops</a>. She’s also much wackier than you might initially assume. Thanks to her digital avatar, she can be whatever she wants on stream, including a worm. Now, to honor a promise she made to her community in exchange for breaking Twitch’s subscriber record, she’ll be <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1840826441132368280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attending the Streamer Awards later this year as a worm</a>, insofar as she is able.</p><p>Specifically, this worm:</p><p>If you’re angry at that worm, I don’t know what to tell you. At least find a less likable worm to be angry at.</p><p>Ironmouse is, of course, over the moon, which she and her community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ironmouse/comments/1frvin1/why_is_chat_saying_fuck_the_moon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intend to fuck</a>.</p><p>"Words cannot express how I am feeling nor can they express my gratitude," she <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1840838608187695267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. "Thank you all so much for the incredible support and thank you for changing my life. Thank you for being the best community in the universe. WE DREAMED BIG AND WE DID IT BROS! I LOVE YOU ALL!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With Amazon's live-action TV adaptation of Like A Dragon/Yakuza fast approaching, the streaming service has shared a first proper trailer for those wanting to get a better look at its exuberant chaos ahead of its 24th October arrival on Prime Video.
</p>
<p>
Like A Dragon: Yakuza, as the series is known, spans two different time periods - 1995 and 2005, to be exact - as it charts the life of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, a "fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity".

"In 1995, eager to escape their restrictive lives, Kiryu and his friends, Nishiki, Yumi, and Miho plan a heist at a local arcade," explains Amazon. "However, the arcade is under the control of the Dojima Family, a powerful yakuza organisation that rules Kamurocho... Meanwhile, in 2005, Kiryu is set to be released from prison. He learns from Detective Date that his friends are in danger and decides to return to Kamurocho to protect them. However, their friendship has deteriorated, as tensions between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance are at a boiling point."

<p>
Kiryu's tale is interwoven with "dramatic stories [the games] have not been able to explore", all focusing on the "dark underworld of the yakuza" and the "universal theme of family not only through bloodline but also through ties between yakuza bosses and their underlings, orphans and their caretakers, as well as mentors and students".
</p>
<p>
For this particular live-action adaptation (a Takashi Miike-directed movie released back in 2007), Kazuma Kiryu is portrayed by actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi, with Masaharu Take on directorial duties. You can get a glimpse of what's to come in the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4tmmzh2PfA">90-second trailer</a> above.
</p>
<p>
Amazon will be hoping Like A Dragon: Yakuza sees at least some of the success enjoyed by its live-action adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> earlier this year, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65m people</a> in its first two weeks. Like a Dragon might not be quite as immediately recognisable as the Fallout brand, but it's hardly an unknown quantity, having sold over 21.3m units worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sega recently announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-with-swashbuckling-trailer">next game in the long-running series</a>, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which is exactly as delightfully bonkers as it sounds.

			<p>The<a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first major patch</a> for FFXIV: Dawntrail is set to be released in mid-November and is titled "Crossroads." This major patch sees the introduction of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ffxvi-fix-mod-adds-ultrawide-support-fov-slider-and-unlocked-frame-rate-in-cutscenes/">Final Fantasy XI</a> crossover Alliance Raid, "Echoes of Vana'diel," which was showcased in a broadcast at the Tokyo Game Show. In this broadcast, Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida highlighted a number of features that will be released in the Patch 7.1, which also includes the continuation of the MSQ (Main Scenario Quest), as well as the first part of the long-awaited Final Fantasy XI crossover, which includes the Alliance Raid series, new Allied Society quests and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="ファイナルファンタジーXIV 『第83回FFXIVプロデューサーレターLIVE』" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hf79RkD_bG8?start=594&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patch 7.1 of FFXIV: Dawntrail will include the 24-player Alliance Raid Echoes of Vana'Diel, which begins the Alliance Raid series that transports players to a new world named Vana'Diel. The Patch 7.1 also adds a lot of different difficult content, such as the first-ever high-difficulty Alliance Raid to be added to the game, where players will be able to take on The Cloud of Darkness on Chaotic difficulty.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chaotic Alliance Raid, new quests will also be added in the MSQ and the new Dungeon titled Yuweyawata Field Station. Players will also get to experience the new Trial named The Minstrel's Ballad: Sphene's Burden, as well as the new Unreal Trial, named The Jade Stoa, where players will be able to face off against Byakko, who is one of the Four Lords.</p>
<p>This is a huge patch for FFXIV: Dawntrail, as there is also the new Ultimate Raid named Futures Rewritten, as well as the addition of new Allied Society quests where players will be able to assist the Pelupelu, with the quests being focused on battle classes and jobs. In the same vein, there is a new Custom Delivery client named Nitowikwe, as well as an additional role quest story becoming available once all Dawntrail role quests are complete. Once that is done, players will gain access to the Wachumeqimeqi story. Finally, out of the new content, there is now even more Hildibrand content for players to get stuck into.</p>
<p>As well as the ton of new content being added to the game, there is now New Game+ support for Patch 7.0, allowing players to replay the MSQ, job quests and role quests. FFXIV has more than 30 million total registered players, and the game continues to be updated regularly, adding new content and making the game more accessible for newcomers who choose to play solo or with friends.</p>

The images they saw featured promotions for long-expired discounts and ads for new games. </p><p>People lamented the change in forums and on social media, saying the game art that previously showed up when they highlighted a game was gone. Instead, the image that would ordinarily show up as a news post in a separate section of the PS5 UI was splashed across the screen behind games like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpnejzv/"><em>Miles Morales</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpn5zxk/"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fsudpe/please_protest_the_ads_on_the_homescreen_on/lpnom6m/"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a>.</p><p>In a since-deleted post, Daniel Hiatt, product lead for Game Hub and Activity Suggestions with PlayStation, wrote Monday afternoon that the change was a “(new) bug with an existing feature.” Then, by 6PM ET, those game pages are back to normal, as we confirmed on our own PS5s. The @AskPlayStation account on X <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1840874460099784888">confirmed the fix</a>, saying:</p><div><blockquote><p>A tech error with the Official News feature on the PS5 console has since been resolved.

We <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">reviewed it</a>!). </p><div><figcaption><em>An example of the bug from a </em>Verge<em> staffer’s PS5.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: PlayStation 5 dashboard</cite></p></div><p>There are whole threads devoted to the change on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1frfzd3/ads_in_the_home_menu/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/newest-ps5-update-replaces-game-backgrounds-audio-in-the-dashboard-with-ads-no-way-to-disable-it-up-its-a-bug-see-threadmarks.995922/">Resetera</a>, but now that it’s reverted, people will have to go back to debating the PS5 Pro, review scores, and why <em>Concord </em>failed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the quick explanation is that earlier this month a zoo in  Si Racha, Thailand posted some images of Moo Deng on Facebook and she quickly became a viral sensation. The zoo has had to implement time limits on viewing and installed cameras to watch out for fans harassing the tiny hippo. And now it seems a lot of people want their very own digital Moo Deng in <em>FF14</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/you-cant-keep-moo-deng-for-yourself-so-final-fantasy-14-players-are-swarming-the-mmos-hippo-calf-minion-instead-and-even-square-enix-has-caught-the-fever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/you-cant-keep-moo-deng-for-yourself-so-final-fantasy-14-players-are-swarming-the-mmos-hippo-calf-minion-instead-and-even-square-enix-has-caught-the-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As first reported by <em>GamesRadar</em></a></span>, in-game prices for <em>FF14</em>'s Hippo Calf minion have increased dramatically since Moo Deng became an internet star. On September 24, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/cerulean_ffxiv/status/1838471276706566477/photo/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/cerulean_ffxiv/status/1838471276706566477/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone posted the prices of Moo Deng on one server in <em>FF14</em></a></span>. Before Moo Deng went viral, you could grab a Hippo Calf for around 30,000 Gil. Not too expensive. Now, you’ll have to pay nearly 300,000 Gil for a calf. </p><p>One thing that likely contributed to the calf’s rising prices was a tweet from the official<em> Final Fantasy 14 </em>Twitter account. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1837552460325687399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1837552460325687399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On September 21</a></span>, the official game account tweeted an image of the calf with the caption: “Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In My Lane. Focused. Flourishing.” The tweet also contained a short clip of the Hippo Calf opening its mouth and being splashed with water, which is classic Moo Deng behavior. So it was obviously a nod to the famous hippo and likely led to even more players hopping into <em>FF14 </em>to buy the minion. </p><p>Of course, if you check your server’s prices, you might not see such high price tags as they can vary from server to server.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/the-moo-deng-frenzy-has-officially-reached-final-fantasy-14-seemingly-causing-the-price-of-its-adorable-hippo-minion-to-skyrocket/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/the-moo-deng-frenzy-has-officially-reached-final-fantasy-14-seemingly-causing-the-price-of-its-adorable-hippo-minion-to-skyrocket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Still, as <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a></span>, in general, the price of the hippo in <em>FF14 </em>is up compared to other minions. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy a Hippo Calf pet, you can grind the level 84 <em>Endwalker</em> expansion dungeon Vanaspati. However, keep in mind it’s a random drop so you might have to run it a few times. Good luck. And if you do find one, you might be better off selling it for a few hundred thousand Gil while the internet is still obsessed with Moo Deng.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s first major story expansion, Shattered Space, is now here, opening up a new, aggressively purple corner of the galaxy for players to explore - and its arrival has been marked with the launch of a big new patch bringing a sweep of fixes to the base game.
</p>
<p>
Patch-wise, update 1.14.70 is fairly lacking in eye-catching headline additions, although it does promise the likes of performance and stability improvements (always welcome), game-wide lighting changes and enhancements,visual updates for weapon models, improved player head tracking when exiting dialogue, and more. That's on top of a chunky list of more specific fixes throughout the game, as detailed in <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1840775449514815736">Bethesda's patch notes</a> - and, for those who want to preserve their clicking fingers, at the bottom of this story.
</p>
<p>
One thing not addressed in Bethesda's patch notes is the Lookup Failed error message that's been dogging Starfield on and off since launch, and which has seen a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/search/?q=lookup&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day&amp;sort=relevance">spike in reports</a> (presumably thanks to the sudden influx of long-absent players) following the release of Shattered Space. This seemingly shader-related issue manifests on the star map, replacing planetary textures with an error message ("Default Planet Material. The swap hasn't occurred you shouldn't be seeing this") in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1fsyz1x/gotta_love_bethesda/">delightfully jaunty typeface</a>.

<p>
If you're running into this, most players are reporting it's easily fixed by restarting the game or clearing Starfield's shader cache on PC, but that doesn't appear to do the trick for everyone, so you might need to hang tight in that case.
</p>
<p>
Players that do manage to access Starfield's Shattered Space expansion hitch-free can explore House Va'ruun's homeward of Va'ruun'kai, where Bethesda appears to very much be leaning into pure space horror - as Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror">discovered</a> back in August.

Over 24 episodes, <em>Ver1.1a </em>offered a gripping retelling of the original story for newcomers while also constantly playing with the franchie’s extended lore to keep longtime fans on their toes. With last week’s finale, the show went out on an undeniable high note that speaks to the story’s effectiveness regardless of medium as well as Taro’s shifting relationship with its themes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the majority of its runtime, the final episode of <em>Ver1.1a</em>, “the [E]nd of YoRHa”, doesn’t mess with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/theres-a-difficult-decision-at-the-end-of-nier-automat-1793071026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-difficult-decision-at-the-end-of-nier-automat-1793071026">true ending</a></span> of the game, from which this finale gets its name. But just when the show seems over and the credits start to roll, things begin to change. Unlike in the game’s ending,<em> Ver1.1a</em> shows us the aftermath of the final confrontation between androids A2, 9S, the machine lifeforms, and the remnants of YoRHa. More shockingly, it’s a happy ending. First we see 9S awaken with his blue eyes shining and no sign of the virus that once threatened his life and sanity. Then we see 2B awaken next to him. The two reunite without their blindfolds and weapons, stripped of their roles as androids of YoRHA. They have a new future ahead of them, together. The credits then cut to A2, resting peacefully next to the <em>NieR </em>franchise’s signature lunar tear growing beside her. It’s a symbol of hope, and a recognition that the better future A2 has fought for is beginning to blossom. A last title card reveals a new name for the episode: “Alternative [E]den.”<br></p><p>Finally, we see a mysterious girl with black pigtails walking away with a large suitcase in hand. She turns to the camera, her bespeckled face staring directly at the viewer. She winks and then the show ends. That girl is perhaps the most important character in the lore of <em>Drakengard </em>and <em>NieR</em>. Her name is Accord and she is a constant observer of the <em>Drakengard/NieR</em> universe whose name pops up in <em>NieR, Automata, </em>and even the now defunct <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/drakengard-3-isnt-just-about-making-a-sequel-not-en-469640600"><em>Reincarnation</em></a></span>.

In one of the game’s many routes, we see the mysterious girl make a phone call to an unknown party after which she is explicitly granted permission to intervene with the narrative and give protagonist Zero a chance to change her fate. While not explicitly said, this unknown party represents creator Yoko Taro intervening in his own narrative to help push the characters towards a better future.</p><figure id="" data-id="4c622c40c4cea9ccbe605a4f90de6aa4" data-recommend-id="image://4c622c40c4cea9ccbe605a4f90de6aa4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1106" data-height="624" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses and black pigtails winks at the camera" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl with glasses and black pigtails winks at the camera" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Aniplex</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4c622c40c4cea9ccbe605a4f90de6aa4" data-recommend-id="image://4c622c40c4cea9ccbe605a4f90de6aa4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1106" data-height="624" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl with glasses and black pigtails winks at the camera" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the <em>Drakengard/Nier </em>series, Taro has always dealt with dark and depressing themes about nihilism and hopelessness in the face of tragedy or overwhelmingly bad odds. There is not much happiness to be found in his games and that which does exist is often fleeting and comes at a cost. Yet with every subsequent game Taro makes, his nihilism seems to be decreasing—.while <em>Automata </em>was already a more hopeful story than anything that came before it (something the director discussed with <em>Kotaku </em>in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208">2018</a></span>) it still comes with so much loss and sacrifice for A2, 2B, 9S, and more. </p><p>But in <em>Ver1.1a</em> Taro gives these characters a chance to be happy. Seven years since the game’s release, it seems he’s decided that these characters have sacrificed enough without seeing the fruit of their suffering. Over the years Taro has shown a growing optimism in his narratives despite the rise of nihilism in the real world. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208">2021 remake</a></span> of the original <em>NieR </em>includes a new ending that lets players save the protagonist from his own sacrifice. Like <em>Ver1.1a</em>’s “Alternative [E]den”, it lets the characters lie in peace. </p><p>With <em>Ver1.1a</em>,<em> </em>Taro shows the rest of the video game industry how to do a remake. Rather than a hollow retreading of a story meant to gain a new audience (and more profit), each time Taro revisits <em>Automata</em>’s story, he interrogates his own artistic intent and execution. Through this approach, <em>Automata </em>has become a shifting thing that reflects Taro’s growing optimism through the lens of the same characters. This is what makes <em>NieR: Automata</em> a masterpiece: whether it be as a video game, a play, a manga, or an anime.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws was plagued with issues at launch, some of which led Ubisoft to make drastic tweaks. It wasn’t well received by the general market, and gamers worldwide have been giving it pretty low scores. It comes as no surprise to learn that in an entire month on the shelves, Star Wars Outlaws has sold just one million copies.</p>



<p>It’s not as many sales as Ubisoft expected, which explains the recent comments about the game’s performance proving ‘softer than expected’. It’s also partly why Assassin’s Creed Shadows was considerably delayed, being pushed back from November 2024 to February 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-the-force-can-t-help">Even The Force Can’t Help</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming hasn’t been able to learn what the expected sales figure was for Star Wars Outlaws, but we have secured a current sales figure from sources close to the game. At the time of writing, Star Wars Outlaws has just ticked over one million sales worldwide.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, we reported in January 2024 that three months after Assassin’s Creed Mirage had hit the market, it had secured five million sales.</p>



<p>In early trailers and demos, Star Wars Outlaws impressed gamers excited to explore a vast, open-world environment as a new character following an original story. As time wore on, the sentiment around the game wavered somewhat, and gameplay videos released close to the launch of the game failed to fill consumers with a sense of anticipation.</p>



<p>On social, content, and streaming platforms, the buzz around Star Wars Outlaws dried up pretty quickly, and all that was left was a string of clips posted to social media showcasing the game’s poor stealth sequences and bugs. This is the kind of thing that Ubisoft moved to patch up not long after launch, but the damage was done.</p>



<p>In thirty days on the market, Star Wars Outlaws has sold just one million copies — and it’s not expected that it’ll shift many more.</p>

Its real charm comes from its excellent cable management options, its ability to house the heaviest PC builds, and plenty of desktop real estate. It also includes an internal power supply, electric height adjustment, and a built-in control panel for easy operation. The height adjustment is key, as it allows the Magnus Pro to double as a standing desk. It may have a premium price, but there's no mistaking the premium look, finish, and feel of this desk.</p><p dir="ltr">While we're giving the Magnus Pro our top rank here, there are two additional versions of the desk worth considering. First is the basic Magnus desk, which is much more affordable than the Pro and features the same sturdy design and helpful cable management solutions, but is a sitting-only option. Then there's the Magnus Pro XL. It’s even priver and clocks in just under $1,000, but it gives you additional width and height--making it easy to fit all your gear. Folks with multiple monitors or a massive ultrawide display will get the most mileage out of the added real estate, although it’s also a great option for someone who has amassed a small army of collectibles and figurines and wants to display them around their battlestation.</p><p dir="ltr">All three Magnus desks are great options out fo the box, Secretlab gives you plenty of ways to customize their look and performance with a long list of accessories. This includes headset hangers, bumpers, monitor mounting arms, and a selection of unique Magpad Desk Mats, which is a full-length cover that acts as a premium oversized mouse pad and comes in a wide variety of styles, allowing you to kit out your desktop with gear from Valorant, Cyberpunk 2077, and other iconic games. You could also pair the desk with Secretlab's Titan Evo or Titan Evo Lite, which are our picks for the best gaming chairs available right now.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk\/dp\/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Ergonomic Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk\/dp\/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Ergonomic-Z1-S-Gaming-Desk/dp/B07DC3321Q?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Eureka Ergonomic Z1-S Gaming Desk</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width: </strong>44 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth: </strong>24 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height: </strong>30 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacity: </strong>500lbs</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Particle board tabletop with carbon fiber finish; Alloy steel base</li><li><strong>Notable features: </strong>Drink holder; Headphone hook; ontroller stand, under-desk socket holder, oversized mouse pad, cable management holes</li></ul><p>If you're looking for the best gaming desk to fill your space and support your gaming equipment, you can't go wrong with Eureka's series of ergonomic desks. The Eureka Z1-S is the standout option--this sturdy desk features a Z-shaped metal frame with an F1 balancing lever near the top of each leg to help stabilize the desk and prevent it from wobbling. It also has four adjustable feet to further help you level the desk. With a length of 44.5 inches, the Eureka Z1-S gaming desk is ideal for a single-monitor setup (although you could certainly fit two smaller ones) and perfect for rooms where space is at a premium.</p><p>Bonus features make this desk even more worthwhile--notably, it comes with RGB lighting on the sides. All you have to do is plug a USB cable into your gaming PC or laptop to power it. The Eureka Z1-S has eight different lighting modes and six different colors so you can customize the effects to your liking. It also features a handy controller stand, a cup holder, cable management grommets, and a headphone hook on the left side. This gaming desk also comes with a large removable mouse pad.</p><p>One drawback: The Eureka Z1-S doesn't come with a built-in retractable keyboard tray; instead, Eureka sells it separately for $100. Considering a retractable keyboard tray greatly improves the ergonomics of this desk, it's a shame the feature doesn't come built-in, but it does leave you with options on how much you want to spend. After trying out the Eureka Z1-S, it's possible you won't miss this feature at all.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable/dp/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable\/dp\/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable/dp/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Premium Sit-to-Stand Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable/dp/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable\/dp\/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Flexispot-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable/dp/B09DYF1SRQ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Flexispot Bamboo Electric Desks</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width: </strong>40-78 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth: </strong>24-30 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height: </strong>Ranges</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacity: </strong>Varies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Metal base; solid bamboo or wood surface</li></ul><p>If your gaming desk doubles as a work station, then you might be best served by a standing desk--and few are as highly reviewed as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/B9F806C9-2B1E-4E97-9B6A-B299BD6AB452?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flexispot's range of electric sit-to-stand desks</a>. Available in a wide variety of designs, Flexispot's hybrid adjustable desks all share the same minimalistic look. We'd recommend opting for the solid bamboo surface, but the models made with solid wood are great, too.</p><p>Many Flexispot bamboo desks, such as the budget-friendly EN2, come with an electric height adjustment panel, allowing you to switch from sitting to standing with the press of a button. Height adjustment ranges vary by model, but some editions offer a range of over 24 inches.</p><p>Flexispot has a wide selection of sizes, so if you don't have a lot of space, one of the 40-inch models could be an ideal choice. For those who prefer huge desks with multiple monitor setups, look for one that's 55 inches or longer. The Flexispot Pro Electric Sit-to-Stand Desk, for instance, comes in five different lengths (in inches): 48, 55, 60, 72, and 78. Depth varies by model, each one has plenty of space--generally 24 to 30 inches--so you don't need to worry about your monitors taking up too much space.</p><p>If you care about storage space, Flexispot wouldn't be the best choice, as the manufacturer largely focuses on making desks with a single piece of solid bamboo or wood attached to a pair of metal legs. Though there are a few models with small cable trays and drawers, such as the aforementioned E2, Flexispot desks aren't designed to double as storage shelves.</p><p>The reason why we didn't pick one specific model for this entry is because Flexispot's range of electric sit-to-stand desks are all quite similar, with the main difference being the thickness of the bamboo or wood surface, which correlates to how much weight the desk can hold.</p><p>Here are three Flexispot desk recommendations at three price points. All three desks come with electric motors to adjust the height, two metal legs, and single-piece solid bamboo surfaces:</p><p>If you need your desk to hold a lot of weight, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FLEXISPOT-Electric-Standing-Whole-Piece-Adjustable/dp/B0CJF2Z1NZ?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flexispot's E8 Dual Motor Electric Desk</a> is a great choice, as it can hold up to 352 pounds.

There are also three cutouts for monitor arm attachment and cable pass-through, plus an under-desk mesh basket for additional cord management. The desk comes standard with a full-surface mouse pad that matches the curved shape of the desk and aligns with the mount punchouts. The mouse pad is water-resistant and machine-washable.</p><p dir="ltr">The desk stands on sturdy steel legs and offers adjustable height options between 28 to 32 inches tall, which should provide enough leg room for most users, and supports up to 176lbs, so it should be able to easily support multiple monitors and other devices--though if you're looking for something that can withstand heavier equipment, you may want to check out some of the more robust options on this list. Nevertheless, this is a big, spacious sitting desk that looks cool and can handle most gaming and home office needs.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone/dp/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone\/dp\/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone/dp/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Budget Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone/dp/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone\/dp\/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Homall-Computer-Workstation-Surface-Headphone/dp/B07ZFD97MM?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Homall Gaming Desk</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width:</strong> 44 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth:</strong> 23.6 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 29.3 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacity:</strong> Not listed</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Laminated plastic desktop; steel base</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Notable features:</strong> Headphone hook, cup holder.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Looking for a smaller desk to fit into a tight room, office, or dorm?

The adjustable height mechanism uses an electric motor that repositions the desk from as low as 28.35 inches to a maximum 46.5 inches tall. The control panel feature three programmable height presets so you can quickly dial-in your preferred height and swap between them quickly. The solid steel frame uses aerospace-grade lifting column connectors that can support up to 176 lbs and maintain stability even when extended to its full height.</p><p dir="ltr">The wood tabletop on the model we're including in this list is 55 inches wide by 28 inches deep, which is an excellent choice if you want a spacious desk that can support multiple monitors and your PC or consoles, but there are several other sizing options available if you want something smaller (40 inches by 24 inches) or even a bit larger (up to 63 inches by 28 inches).

The extra space lets you spread out your gaming or work setups, making for a more comfortable and versatile desktop. However, some L-shaped desks are essentially two large desks shoved together, and that's not always ideal. Instead, we recommend the Eureka L60 Gaming Desk. The desk is essentially an ultra-wide desk with a small bonus flange where you can set up secondary equipment like a bonus monitor, a laptop, a drawing tablet--really anything that fits its 32.6-inch wide dimensions. While it's not as large as other L-shaped options (including several on this list) the entire tabletop comes as a single piece, making for a stable setup that can golf up to 170 lbs. You can also select whether you want the L flange on the left or right side of the desk.</p><p dir="ltr">As a bonus pick, we would also recommend the Eureka L60 gaming desk, which features similar dimensions but with a four-legged base design and slightly lower price tag.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving/dp/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving\/dp\/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving/dp/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Budget L-Shaped Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving/dp/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving\/dp\/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-L-Shaped-Workstation-Space-Saving/dp/B082Y16QZ2?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Mr. Ironstone L-Shaped Work Station</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Width:</strong> 50.8 inches (exterior sides); 32.8 inches (interior sides)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Depth: </strong>18.2 inches</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Height: </strong>29.5 inches</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 160lbs on main tables, 150lbs on corner.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Wood tabletops, metal frame</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Notable features:</strong> Optional 7.9 x 18.9 inch monitor stand/shelf</p><p dir="ltr">This L-shaped desk from Mr. Ironstone comes in four different colors, including the all-black one shown above.

You can count on it to be extremely sturdy and stable thanks to its X-shaped support bars, adjustable feet, and six separate legs to hold it upright. The bars along the bottom are also designed to be a footrest if you'd like, although if you have long legs, you could end up feeling cramped.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal of an L-shaped gaming desk is obviously the amount of surface area and support it offers, and this Mr. Ironstone desk gets the job done well. It can support two to three monitors plus your gaming PC or console without fear of anything collapsing, and it has an optional monitor stand to make it even more space-efficient. The bevel edge in the middle is cleverly designed to offer room for cables to slide down between the desk and the wall corner.

For just over $300, you get a full 60 inches of workspace on either side, with the surface measuring 24 inches deep on the left side and 20 inches on the right. That's plenty of space to put your monitors, gaming PC, console(s), keyboard, and anything else you might need. The desk can hold up to 200 pounds of weight, so you don't have to worry about this one collapsing. It also features a four-port USB hub and a soft tray in an open cubby for storing and charging small devices, which is quite handy.</p><p>This Bush Furniture desk gets you extra storage space for your gaming equipment, with two drawers on one side and a concealed storage cabinet with a fluted glass door on the other side. These offer a great place to store extra gaming accessories, cords, games, and even your CPU tower if you want. Keep in mind this isn't solid wood, but rather engineered wood, so it'll show scratches and damage easier, but the dark espresso finish still gives it a nice look, even if it probably won't match your gaming chair color scheme.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging/dp/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging\/dp\/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging/dp/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Compact L-Shaped Gaming Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging/dp/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging\/dp\/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bestier-Desk-Computer-Reversible-Charging/dp/B0BPYGSZZ9?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Bestier Small Gaming Desk</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width:</strong> 42 inches (outside edge) 31.5 inches (interior edge)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth:</strong> 31.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height: </strong>30 inches (plus 6-inch monitor stand)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacities:</strong> 80lbs main tabletop; 40lbs side table; 25lbs under-desk shelves; 15lbs monitor stand</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials: </strong>Wood tabletop with carbon fiber finish; metal frame and under-desk shelves.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Notable features: Monitor stand with RGB lighting; two under-desk shelves; multi-port charging strip; headphone hook</p><p dir="ltr">While bigger L-shaped desks are awesome if you have the space, many are essentially just two large desktops fused together, leading to a big footprints that aren't feasible for everyone--or even all that necessary.

On the plus side, it includes a lock button on the control panel as well as a digital height readout screen and four programmable height presets.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mojo Gamer Pro is available in matte black, matte charcoal, Carbon Fiber (dark gray), and white desktop colors, and black or gray bases.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-desks/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk/2520995.html?lang=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/store.hermanmiller.com\/gaming-desks\/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk\/2520995.html?lang=en_US&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-desks/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk/2520995.html?lang=en_US">Best Warranty</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-desks/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk/2520995.html?lang=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/store.hermanmiller.com\/gaming-desks\/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk\/2520995.html?lang=en_US&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-desks/motia-gaming-sit-to-stand-desk/2520995.html?lang=en_US">Herman Miller x Logitech G Motia Gaming Desk</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width:</strong> 58 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth:</strong> 29 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height: </strong>27-46 inches, Adjustable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Wood tabletop, metal base</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Notable features:</strong> Simplified sit/stand mechanism; anti-glare/anti-smudge tabletop.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Herman Miller X Logitech G Motia is a luxury gaming desk with a price tag to match. It costs much more than some of the other desks on this list, but its quality justifies the investment. And thanks to its generous warranty--up to 12 years for the desktop surface, the base, and all electrical parts and moving mechanism--that investment will be safe for years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">The Motia is a sturdy, durable desk with a sophisticated and understated look--not something you normally expect from a "gaming" accessory. The Motia comes in black and white color options, both of which feature a smudge-proof, anti-glare tabletop and a sleek sit-to-stand mechanism powered by electric motors and telescoping leg supports. The controls for changing height are simple to use, too--maybe too simple, in fact. Unlike some other sit-stand desks, the Motia lacks programmable memory buttons. It also does not include extra USB ports like other desks, and doesn't come with the necessary tools for setup in the box.</p><p dir="ltr">However, those omissions are the only real drawbacks of this desk. If it fits in your budget--and that's a big if--and you are looking for something that's sturdy and backed by the best-possible warranty, you'll be hardpressed to find a better option than the Motia.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable/dp/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable\/dp\/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable/dp/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Best Budget Standing Desk</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable/dp/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable\/dp\/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vari-Essential-Converter-Accessories-Adjustable/dp/B0B75F3XBN?tag=gamespot-gamingdesks-20">Varidesk Essential Vertical Lift 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specifications</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Width:</strong> 30 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Depth:</strong> 24 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> Adjustable between 4.75 inches to 19.5 inches; manual mechanical adjustment</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 25lbs</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Materials:</strong> Laminated MDF Plywood desktop; metal base and mechanisms</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The benefits of a standing desk are well-documented, but buying one—especially a sit-stand desk—is expensive. Luckily, there are simple alternatives that you can add to your existing sitting-only desk that convert it into a sit-stand desk. While many of these cost a lot less than buying an entire desk, one of the most affordable is Varidesk's Essential Vertical Lift 30.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Varidesk Essential Vertical Life 30 is much smaller than other desks on this list, and its 25lb maximum weight limit means you won't be able to put much more than your monitor or laptop on it, the slimmer dimensions have benefits, too. Namely, it's small enough to fit on most desks, tables, counters, or other flat surfaces. Plus, being so light means you can move it around or remove it if needed.</p><p dir="ltr">When it's sitting flat, the desk adds an additional 4.75 inches to your desk. The maximum 19.5-inch height might sound shorter than other desks, but remember that this is in <em>addition to </em>your existing desktop. So if your desk is already 25 inchs tall, this can increase the height to nearly 45 inches. Adjustments are made with the single-handle pneumatic gas spring. The metal base is wide enough to keep the desk stable even when the height is fully extended.</p><p dir="ltr">The desktop is black MDF (medium-density fiberboard) plywood with a laminated finish that gives the desk a simple, sleek look and also easy to clean. It also has sloped edges, which help keep your hands and wrists comfortable while working or gaming.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h2><strong>What to look for in a gaming desk</strong></h2><p>The best gaming desk will offer you plenty of space for all your gaming gear: from monitor and keyboard to mouse, speakers, headset stand, and any other accessories you want to have in your gaming setup. Whether you have a PC or use a PS5 or Xbox Series X at your desk, we're talking about tech you've probably spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on, so you want to make sure your gaming desk is sturdy enough to support all that heavy equipment and has the right cable management options to keep it all nice and organized. It's important to consider the desk's frame and what material it's made of--can the legs support potentially hundreds of pounds of weight? If you're buying a standard office desk rather than a dedicated gaming desk, keep an eye out for ones with adjustable foot pads that will ensure the desk is stable.</p><p>Aesthetics matter too. Do you prefer a wooden desk, or is a modern metal desk more your style? The desk surface is also an important consideration--a smooth gaming surface is important. A tempered glass surface is an especially sleek option. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you'll want to keep comfort in mind, making sure there's enough room under the desk for your knees and legs. An adjustable desk that can be raised or lowered is great for ensuring your desk is at the proper ergonomic height, though height adjustment options are often more expensive.</p><h2><strong>Different types of gaming desks</strong></h2><p>It's important to know how you want to use your desk too, depending on your specific gaming needs--are you looking for a simple one-monitor gaming setup, or are you planning to have multiple monitors and a heavy PC tower on top of it as well? There are standard gaming desks, ultrawide ones, and curved desks that offer varying amounts of desk space and weight capabilities--some even help you store your gaming gear. L-shaped gaming desks are popular as well--some people even buy two to set up a massive U-shaped desk area. Regular computer desks can work great for gaming too and can help lower your cost. And if you're someone who works from home full-time, a standing desk is worth considering to help you take more standing breaks throughout the day. In this guide, we've tried to include a variety of options to help you find the best gaming desk for you.</p><p>And if you're looking to get into PC gaming, we've got more guides to help make the process easier, especially if you're looking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-builds-2020-desktop-rigs-for-different-pri/1100-6476963/" data-ref-id="1100-6476963">build your own gaming PC</a>.

Sure, during the weekend we got a chance to see the upcoming sequel’s impressive photo mode, modeled by the Hollywood actors who Kojima has scanned and placed into the highly anticipated game. But we didn’t just get that: we also got a chance to look at (and definitely not buy) an incredible <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://acrnm.com/J91-WSDB_NA#a-image_27918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://acrnm.com/J91-WSDB_NA#a-image_27918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> jacket collaboration between Kojima Productions and high-end outerwear company Acronym</a></span>.<br></p><p>I say “definitely not buy” because the entire collection sold out within minutes of its announcement (which came midday Sunday), and also because you are very likely not to be the kind of person who would spend more than $1,700 on a jacket. (However, I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that Acronym is like the Cadillac of drippy outerwear.) The jacket, known as the J91-WSDB, is modular, which means it can be modified (it’s got a removable hood and a strap that allows you to take it off and carry it like a bag) , so you’re getting a few jackets for the price of one very expensive one. The jacket is also shown being worn under and over different Acronym designs, like a spiked outer layer and a sheer paneled bodysuit. Kojima is the model in some of these pictures, which is such a G move. </p><p>The jacket comes in black with orange details or orange with black details, and there are several nods to<em> Death Stranding </em>hidden in the admittedly very cool design. There’s “DOOMS only” text written in low-profile font near the wrist of one of the sleeves, a massive Drawbridge logo (the company Sam Porter Bridges will work for in the sequel), and what looks to be a little cryptobiote keychain hanging off one of the straps.</p><p>Both colorways sold out not too long after they were announced, which is a bummer. I’m a huge fan of video game clothing collaborations being actually cool and fashionable rather than dorky and overly simplistic, like screenprinted tees or garishly patterned blazers. <span><a

href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-fashion-elden-ring-ark8-style-1851025334">Brands like ARK/8</a></span> are embodying this movement towards outfitting gamers in cool shit, and this Acronym x Kojima

So perhaps it’s no surprise that he currently has plans to expand his work into film and television. But that’s all happening while he also helms a sequel to the Norman Reedus-led <em>Death Stranding</em>, and has two other original games on the horizon. It’s a lot to keep track of, which is why we’re putting it all in one place for your easy reference. Here’s everything we know about Hideo Kojima’s upcoming work.<br></p></div><div><p>Easily the most high-profile thing we know coming out of Kojima Productions right now is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760"><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></a></span>. The sequel sees the return of both Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges and Léa Seydoux as Fragile, but also has several other big names joining the cast this time around, with Elle Fanning, Shioli Kutsuna, <em>Mad Max</em> director George Miller, and filmmaker Fatih Akin all set to play new characters. <em>On The Beach </em>will follow Sam after he is recruited to help “build bridges” to bring the rest of the world together as he did for America in the original game. Much of that will involve the same traversal, shooting, and online infrastructure-building as the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, though Kojima may well through players a few curve balls, too. The game will launch on PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p></div><div><p>While <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a known quantity at this point, Kojima Productions is working on two other games that we only know through teases. The first of these enigmas is <em>OD</em>, a horror game published by Xbox Game Studios. Whether that means it will only come to Xbox and Windows, we don’t yet know, as Microsoft has been releasing games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-game-pass-ps5-exclusive-1851626140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-game-pass-ps5-exclusive-1851626140">on other platforms of late</a></span>. We <em>do </em>know that the game will star Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, and will be co-written by <em>Get Out</em> writer-director Jordan Peele. Some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-od-xbox-metal-gear-1851095794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-od-xbox-metal-gear-1851095794">footage of the game leaked</a></span> last year that implied there might be a multiplayer component.</p></div><div><p>The most recent game announcement out of Kojima Productions is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/physint-hideo-kojima-new-game-state-play-1851214597"><em>Physint </em>(working title)</a></span>. We haven’t seen any footage or even concept art of the game, but Kojima says it will be a return to the espionage genre that made him famous. He described it as “the culmination of [his] work” during the January 31 State of Play presentation, and said that it is both a game and “also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound.” We don’t know what that entails yet, but the game is likely a long way away. </p></div><div><p>Those are the video game projects Kojima is working on, but he’s also making moves in film. This includes a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">movie set in the <em>Death Stranding </em>universe</a></span>, though it won’t be a direct adaptation of the 2019 game. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, Kojima said he only ever thought of the original <em>Death Stranding </em>“as a game,” thus has no plans to look back on it for the film. He will be supervising the plot but not directing the movie, which is being made in partnership with A24 and Hammerstone Studios, as he can’t dedicate himself to that with three games in development.</p></div><div><p>While the movie is the highest-profile adaptation we know about, Kojima told <em>Variety</em> there are “several” <em>Death Stranding </em>projects in the works. He didn’t go into specifics, so now we get to speculate about whether there might be<em> Death Stranding</em> television shows, anime, books, comics, audio dramas, or other works in our future. </p></div><div><p>In the same <em>Variety</em> interview, Kojima said he is moving through three “phases” within his studio’s lifetime. The first phase was to create the original <em>Death Stranding</em>, the second is the one it’s in now, which is to create movies, anime, TV dramas, and more based on the IP. The third phase, he says, will begin with <em>Physint</em>, and could include internal film and TV plans that are not directly tied to a video game IP.</p></div><div><p>Kojima has signed with Hollywood agency WME, which created a team to work with him. He told <em>Variety</em> that he feels the agency understands him and that having a team would help him better juggle his projects and his work with actors.</p><p>“Well, there are many big agencies out there,” Kojima told <em>Variety</em>. “I’ve met many people over the years, but it’s important to me that I work with people who understand games and understand me. I also need people who can basically traffic control all that I do. Until now, I’ve been personally handling exchanges with all the actors that wanted to work together, but it has become difficult to manage on my own. And with all the offers I receive, the most important thing is knowing who to trust. WME created a whole team for me, and they understand me the most. I feel a lot of love from them. They are very powerful within the industry as well, of course. I don’t intend to make myself 10 times busier than I am already. I just want to be able to do everything that I want to do in my remaining lifetime without wasting time. I can also learn more about what the world is demanding, so it’s really great.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve never played the OG game. Yet, it’s one of those PS1 games that is fundamental to the console and the PlayStation brand. Likewise, later <em>Final Fantasy</em> games would be extremely popular hits on PlayStation consoles, too. As well as Square Enix games like<em> Drakengard, Dragon Quest 8, Grandia III,</em> and more.

Sure, <em>Syphon Filter </em>in 2024 is far from a popular franchise, but back in the PS1 days the first three games were big sellers and had a large fan base. So it’s odd that nobody from the third-person stealth-shooter series popped up in Astro Bot’s latest adventure.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="94e42944779eb2a9f152c65e2714b06c" data-recommend-id="image://94e42944779eb2a9f152c65e2714b06c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94e42944779eb2a9f152c65e2714b06c" data-recommend-id="image://94e42944779eb2a9f152c65e2714b06c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We already mentioned that <em>Astro Bot</em> lacks<em> Final Fantasy </em>characters, which is already a wild and disappointing fact. But it’s also weird that Sony and Disney weren’t able to work out something to get <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ main star Sora—who is owned by Disney—to make an appearance in <em>Astro Bot</em>. Perhaps Square Enix’s lack of involvement discouraged the House of Mouse from stepping on the publisher’s toes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d31e3605645d6c5535b20f2d7c533077" data-recommend-id="image://d31e3605645d6c5535b20f2d7c533077" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d31e3605645d6c5535b20f2d7c533077" data-recommend-id="image://d31e3605645d6c5535b20f2d7c533077" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cinematic third-person action game <em>The Order: 1886</em> might not be the best PlayStation 4 exclusive out there, but it’s still a part of the company’s history, and leaving out Galahad—the main character in the game—feels like a mistake.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1d9d4e5e54cd3c736b11b242b8bbbca" data-recommend-id="image://c1d9d4e5e54cd3c736b11b242b8bbbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c1d9d4e5e54cd3c736b11b242b8bbbca" data-recommend-id="image://c1d9d4e5e54cd3c736b11b242b8bbbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Blasto </em>wasn’t a great game, I don’t think anyone would disagree. But it was a big deal at the time of its release in 1998 on PS1. It starred the late Phil Hartman and looked like a fun space-themed platform shooter. Instead, it was mostly a so-so adventure forgotten quickly after its release. But considering some of the obscure characters who show up in <em>Astro Bot</em>, it feels like Captain Blasto should have got an invite, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2474962f7c0f5158406049cf7aaff893" data-recommend-id="image://2474962f7c0f5158406049cf7aaff893" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->KOEI</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2474962f7c0f5158406049cf7aaff893" data-recommend-id="image://2474962f7c0f5158406049cf7aaff893" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s run down some of the traits<em> Astro Bot’</em>s cameo characters share. Debuted in a popular game or a beloved cult classic? Check. Starred in a game primarily exclusive to PlayStation? Check! A cool, iconic look that could be easily translated to <em>Astro Bot</em>’s aesthetics? Check! And yet, U-1 from the beloved PS2 rhythm game<em> Gitaroo Man</em> is nowhere to be found in Astro Bot.

The survival horror franchise debuted on PlayStation in 1999, got a well-received sequel in 2000, a mostly-forgotten light gun spin-off in 2002, and then a third sequel in 2003. That last entry was exclusive to the OG Xbox and took the series into space. It wasn’t a fan favorite. Since then <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its red-headed star Regina have been mostly left to gather dust by Capcom. A cameo bot in A<em>stro Bot</em> wouldn’t have satisfied fans wanting more <em>Dino Crisis</em>, sure, but it would have at least been a nice way of Capcom going “Hey, Regina is still around.”</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-recommend-id="image://cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-recommend-id="image://cf1b21e7d0da40f495ba6bf422960dd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>“Do y’know where we are?” NYPD officer Aya Brea asks the mutant blob pursuing her through the bowels of a freighter on the Hudson River, right after she overloads the ship’s boiler to blow the monstrosity to smithereens. “We’re in Hell’s Kitchen!”<br></p><p>I love a good one-liner, and this one, from the climax of 1998’s <em>Parasite Eve</em>, has always stuck with me.

<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows would be delayed from its intended November release date to February 2025. While the announcement was somewhat of a shock publically, internally, it was expected and desperately needed.</p>



<p><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft announced</a>&nbsp;that the game was delayed “to polish and refine the experience. “</span> In its earnings update, the company further claimed that the delay was due to “the learning from the Star Wars Outlaws release.” Both claims are true, but beyond a few short words, internally, the developers have been pushing for a delay for the best part of a few months, which had fallen on deaf ears until the release of Outlaws.</p>



<div><p><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yves Guillemot pointed out in an internal memo</a>&nbsp;that Star Wars Outlaws’ initial sales “proved softer than expected,” with Guillemot pointing out that critics rated the game 76 out of 100 on Metacritic (I think it’s important to note that the user score is far lower at a 5.4 out of 10, too).</span> Although I wasn’t given the figure on what Ubisoft anticipated Outlaws to sell within its first month, the game has just surpassed 1 million units sold at the time of writing. Its performance has seemingly caused alarm bells to ring at HQ, which not only led to the approval of Assassin’s Creed Shadows being delayed to Q1 2025 but to finally putting games back on Steam (a request that every Ubisoft team has been pushing for years). </p><p>So why was Shadows delayed? It’s a complicated question without a single answer, but it boils down to a strict development timeline, polishing, and addressing the Japanese community’s cultural and historical accuracy concerns.</p></div>



<p>But first, let me address some of the wild rumors about Yasuke—he’s not going to be removed. However, sources have said that the team has been actively addressing many of the historical and cultural concerns, which started before the game’s reveal following external playtests and were accelerated further following the game’s initial reveal and mass feedback. This includes changing some of Yasuke’s story and how he’s portrayed in the game, fixing architectural details, and ensuring that the game is historically grounded while fitting into the Assassin’s Creed universe. </p>



<div><p>Fundamentally, though, these are issues that should have been caught internally before the game’s reveal, especially given Ubisoft’s strict asset-approval process. As for how these issues fell through the cracks, I’m told that historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude and that miscommunication between teams and cutting corners when it came to the approval process of assets to meet deadlines were also at play.</p><p>As for the game’s polish and issues with bugs, it’s pretty self-explanatory. The game is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release, and I’m told that there have been some tweaks to some gameplay mechanics and elements that are going to take time to incorporate. While some of these issues were highlighted in recent playtests and mock reviews, these are end-of-development issues that will take a little longer.</p></div>



<div><p>Of course, these are not new issues for the team. Seven developers working on the project said that they have been pushing for a delay for some time, and their situation had even been heard at other studios in the company. Ultimately, though, the delay comes down to a strict development timeline and the need to address issues caused by the set timeline. As for why Ubisoft HQ continues to ignore the developers on almost every level, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s Executive Committee and Board of Directors will decide in their review</a> – although 80% of 40 Ubisoft developers think this ends in no change or layoffs – but that’s another story on the internal issues for another time.</p><p>For now, though, Ubisoft Quebec will release Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14, 2025, and while the game isn’t matching Valhalla in pre-order numbers (which launched on past-generation consoles to a wider market), the numbers are solid and are likely to rise further given its Steam release announcement.</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Nekojima Board Game Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nekojima-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nekojima-board-game-review.996831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nekojima-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Nekokima is a Japanese term that translates as “cat island”, which is potentially something of a problem if you’re trying to wire up an electricity network in the area. That’s the premise for this curious and spectacular-looking dexterity board game from the wonderfully named Unfriendly Games in which you’ve not only got to stack up a crisscross of wires without them touching, but deal with an infestation of frisky felines who want to hang from the cat’s cradle you’ve inadvertently created.</p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><div catalogid="82b1d311-1ea1-49a6-b6f7-7535a9f09273" id="207880"><div id="207880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nekojima</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity games often come packed with all sorts of unexpected objects, and Nekojima is no exception. The bulk of the box space is filled up with thick wooden dowels of various lengths, paired together with stiff bits of cord, from one of three different potential colors. Each color has two or three possible pairings of different-length dowels. They’re meant to represent pylons, with the cords as power cables.</p><p>The remainder of the contents are circumspect in comparison. There’s a thick, circular plastic board, divided into four quadrants, and a sheet of counters which include some sinuous, chunky cardboard cats. There are also two custom wooden dice and a collection of wooden cubes in the same three colors as the cords plus black, to match the cats. The cubes go into a supplied linen draw bag.</p><p>It’s not the most attractive game at first glance – the only art is on the board and it, alongside the dice icons, are more about function than form. But, as is often the case, the visual kicks in Nekokima come from what you do with the components rather than the pieces themselves.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><p>Again, like many of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">best dexterity games</a>, this is a pretty simple affair. On your turn you’ll roll the two dice which will indicate two quadrants of the board. Sometimes you might get to choose, sometimes an opponent will get to pick instead. You then draw a cube from the bag, pick a pair of dowels - they’re called Denchuu, which is Japanese for “power pole” – and you place one dowel in one of the specified board quadrants, and the other in the other. Occasionally, both poles need to go in the same quadrant. Simple!</p><p>Except of course, it isn’t. The poles have a specific orientation with the cords at the top and, once placed, the cords are not allowed to touch any poles, or any other cords, nor to hang over the board edge. The first couple of placements are very straightforward, but very soon a web of cords will be threading across the board, necessitating much more imaginative and nimble placements. To make matters worse, you’re not allowed to tweak the cord position with your fingers: you can only adjust it by manipulating the two poles themselves. The cord is stiff, but still has a tendency to misbehave just when you think you’ve wrangled it into position.</p><p>If you finish placing the poles and the cords break this rule, you have to extract them and try again, which a sweaty-palmed ordeal in and of itself. But even when you succeed, your job may not be done. If you were unlucky enough to draw any black cubes on your turn, you have to keep drawing until you get a color, and then hang black cats on matching cords without, again, the cats or cords touching each other, the poles or the ground. There are a selection of such death-defying feline shapes, some of which are much easier to hang than others.</p><p>Naturally, the ground space on the board fills up very quickly, and players must then start to stack the poles atop one another. This is where the different heights of the poles on each denchuu become interesting, as, with a bit of thought, they allow you to make both easier and more interesting placements. You have no way of knowing what your opponents are going to roll, but you can certainly try to cramp their style by throwing a cord across an open area. This opens up all sorts of interesting risk versus reward decisions as regards how hard you want to make life for yourself in the quest to make life harder for your opponents, which all contributes toward forcing the tower higher.</p><p>As it turns out, the poles are thick enough to stack with a fairly high degree of stability, which is kind of both a blessing and a curse. The problem is that it can make the early game feel too easy as you pile poles atop each other and up into the stratosphere. The upsides are that it both makes the game look spectacular on the table as your man-made forest ascends to head-height, festooned with cats and bright-colored wires, and that it ensures an exciting endgame as the foundations finally begin to wobble. Hanging cats also has the potential to cause instant chaos, even on a relatively low tower.</p><p>If piling the poles competitively isn’t your thing, the game plays well both cooperatively and solitaire with a very simple rules change. Drawn cubes all slot into a level board that runs up to level seven, with four cubes per level. Your challenge, either solo or working in a group, is simply to beat the highest level you can. The interesting thing about playing this way is that it reverses the calculations needed to rope off areas and block them from other players: rather, you want to stack and twist in places that will make it easier to follow on. There are also a number of variants included to try, extending the game’s replay value by doing things like limiting the stack height, or playing in pairs with each player taking one of a denchuu.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4b25A?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/znOVK4?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hatchette</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6rjv?object_uuid=16bc6fef-7fdf-47f9-91c6-f329c0e7e375&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">best RPG board games</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a> to play now.</p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 30, 2024 8:12 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Nekojima is a fun stacking game with a cool twist that isn’t quite cool enough to make it stand out strongly from the pack. Nevertheless, it looks great on the table, has an unusual theme and has a wide range of variants suitable for different ages and play styles, all of which make it adaptable to a smorgasbord of tastes and situations. A lot of its peers try to make their mark by adding additional layers of complexity which sometimes obscure the raw fun of stacking things in big, wobbly piles, and if it’s that elemental joy that you’re after, Nekojima delivers it handsomely.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
