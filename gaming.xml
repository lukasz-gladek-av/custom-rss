<figure data-uuid="88a2e646c18a2"><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88a2e646c18a2/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> may have already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-already-being-datamined-watch-out-for-spoilers">leaked online</a>, but that apparently isn't devastating enough for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p>Now, the alleged hacker behind last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-massive-amounts-of-data-allegedly-leaked">'Teraleak'</a> – in which huge amounts of data had leaked online – has now supposedly returned and released Legends Z-A's source code, beta builds (including two from PC and three from Switch), and around 10GB of related documentation (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/13/pokemon-legends-z-a-source-code-and-early-builds-leaked-on-online-forum/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>We won't go too deep into what the leak entails, but it's an incredibly revealing one that shines a spotlight on a number of in-game features that have been scrapped entirely for the final game. One of these – and this is hardly a spoiler, don't worry – is that the windows and balconies seen on the infamous in-game buildings were once much more detailed, and were actually modelled correctly rather than being simple flat assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2yorqwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Needless to say, if you want to see the full results of this latest leak, it's all out there. Just please be mindful of what you're posting in the comments and don't reveal anything that might be deemed a spoiler.</p>
<p>We don't have much longer to wait until Legends Z-A launches worldwide, so hold on a bit longer, folks! The game drops on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2, with the latter boasting 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The 'Teraleak' from 2024 also contained the source code from other Pokémon titles, personal employee information, and details relating to cancelled projects. Nintendo predictably sought to find out who was responsible, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-on-a-mission-to-unmask-the-pokemon-teraleak-hacker">requesting Discord reveal the identity of a specific user</a>.</p>

			<p>New footage reportedly showing the Leon campaign in Resident Evil Requiem may have already been released, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who, despite a mixed track record, <span>has proven to have access to insider information regarding the survival horror series by CAPCOM in the past</span>, Leon is already in the&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem first trailer&nbsp;in two small ways. According to the insider, they are minor but more obvious when looking back.</p>



<p>Besides discussing Leon's small appearance in the Resident Evil Requiem first trailer, Dusk Golem also mentioned that, from what they understand, most players will play as Leon. This seems to suggest the game won't have separate campaigns for Grace and Leon but a single, larger campaign featuring both characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon is in the first trailer, in two small ways, but they're minor and be more obvious when looking back.<br>While this is subjective, I believe with how the game is structured that more of the game will be played as Leon by most players from how I understand it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1976775421728637017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As there's still no official indication that Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem, we have to take what Dusk Golem said with a massive grain of salt. However, there could be some truth to the insider's latest statements. On X, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Persian">@RE_Persian</a> took a good look at what could be one of the sequences where footage lifted from the Leon campaign is shown. The footage strongly suggests the cutscene is from a first-person point of view that is not Grace's, as what seems to be her hair appears on one side of the screen, which wouldn't happen if it were her POV.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(4/5) the beginning of the shot, the camera slightly moves as if following a head movement. This is a classic sign of a first person POV. <a href="https://t.co/GmqLowA8Rd">pic.twitter.com/GmqLowA8Rd</a></p>— Resident Evil | رزیدنت اویل (@RE_Persian) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Persian/status/1977259021506613296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>With Resident Evil Requiem getting closer to its February 27, 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, there's a solid chance it won't take much longer to learn if Leon Kennedy is indeed in the game as rumored. In the meantime, check out my Gamescom hands-on preview to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">learn what already makes Grace's gameplay hauntingly beautiful.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-arrives-on-pc-and-consoles-this-month.1323706/</guid>

			<p>Beneath, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593230/Beneath/?curator_clanid=34817714">Lovecraftian-themed survival horror shooter</a> from developer Camel 101 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/">publisher Wired Productions</a>, finally has release dates set for its arrival on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. It'll arrive on PC on Steam this coming October 27, 2025, with its console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 coming the following day on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>Players would recognize Camel 101 from previous games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/715380/Those_Who_Remain/">Those Who Remain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/409320/Syndrome/?curator_clanid=34817714">Syndrome</a>, the former of which was also published by Wired Productions. Alongside the news of the game's full release, Camel 101 has also released a demo for the game on Steam as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">October Steam Next Fest</a>, which officially kicks off today, October 13, and runs until October 20.</p>



<p>Camel 101 also debuted a new launch trailer for Beneath, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beneath | Launch Date Trailer | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomQIDx4l90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beneath is a single-player shooter that sees you step into the shoes of Noah Quinn, a veteran diver who finds himself trapped under the ocean on what should have been a routine dive. Now, he has to contend with all sorts of horrors with whatever weapons and ammo he can find in this survival horror adventure.</p>



<p>With the third iteration of Steam Next Fest set to kick off today, Beneath isn't the only game you'll find with new demos available on Steam starting today. Also, don't be too concerned if you miss the festival, since several of the demos, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">including ones that we checked out back in June</a>, often aren't taken down once the festival is officially over. So if you know you won't have a moment over the next seven days to sit down and play some demos, mark what looks interesting and come back later - it will likely still be available to play and check out. </p>

            <p>There's a container. It needs to be moved. Get in this big crane thing and move it. That's the short and sweet summary of the Steam Next Fest demo for Docked, Saber Interactive's latest addition to their ever-expanding roster of simulations based around jobs which require high-vis gear.</p>

<p>Docked's laser-sharp focus on simulating the workings of a port means that, at least as far as its Next Fest demo is concerned, there's very little of the driving that characterises siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a>. You're not commuting, because all of your jobs are in and around Port Wake. Instead, Saber look to be aiming at the demographic of folks who've lived for the bits of their previous works which saw you given a crane and told to load some cargo onto your lorry, usually with a crane.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, this has never been where much of the appeal lies to me. Though, that might be because of my tendency to rush and end up having a bunch of logs escape to freedom. That said, if you're in it for the chance to get behind the complex controls of some heavy machinery, Docked's got you covered. The demo consists for four little jobs, with the first charging you to scale a colossal ship-to-shore crane, running around on foot as you fire it up. Once you're in, the act of moving containers off a damaged ship wasn't too far from what I've experienced in other Saber sims, but I did appreciate the change in pace that a bit of first-person climbing represented.</p><p>To be honest, that's where the demo peaks. The other jobs also revolve around moving containers, but this time with smaller vehicles. The straddle carrier you get to use last was my favourite of these, as it's a giraffe-esque contraption that drives astride containers to pick them up, which is wonderfully satisfying compared to the more mundane craneing of its cousin the reach stacker.</p>
<p>The menus suggest there'll be plenty of more in-depth port management in the full thing, but none of it's available just yet. That's a bit of a bummer, as I think for Docked to really catch on, it'll be the aspect of the game which has to do the most heavy lifting. Saber themselves have already put out plenty of games in which you can lift a thing using a big machine, but I can't think of too many games which put you in charge of a full port. It remains to be seen just how much there is to the upgrades and changes you'll be able to make to Port Wake, but since it seems likely to be the game's calling card, I'd hope the answer's plenty.</p>
<p>There's still no concrete release date to wait for right now, but you can both find Docked's Next Fest demo and wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-letting-the-dji-mini-3-fly-more-drone-combo-go-for-prime-day-low-to-empty-the-warehouse-2000634488</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-letting-the-dji-mini-3-fly-more-drone-combo-go-for-prime-day-low-to-empty-the-warehouse.1323688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K HDR Recording, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-alpha footage trailer for Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game has got fans of the enormously popular Avatar the Last Airbender animated series excited, but there are questions over exactly what type of game fans can expect, and who’s actually developing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is described as being “rooted in the spirit of elemental mastery.” Its official blurb continues: “Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression. Built with a focus on fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity, the game invites players to discover what it truly means to fight with purpose. Hand-drawn in 2D, it is crafted to preserve the style and expressive animation of the original series.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">12 playable characters are expected at launch, with “many more” released via a seasonal model. There are selectable support characters who “influence your fighting style and grant special moves.” The unique “Flow System” provides “movement centric” gameplay. There’s a single-player “campaign” with an original narrative, combo trials, a gallery mode, and “best in class” netcode and crossplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional features and mechanics will be announced soon, and Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a working title, so expect the name to change. There’s no release date, but the release window is set for summer 2026 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC via Steam, where you can wishlist the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the trailer and its Steam page, Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is developed and published by the little known Gameplay Group International. A recent <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/gameplay-group-international-will-revive-games-that-have-been-canceled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesBeat</a> article pulled back the curtain on this newly-formed studio, whose business model appears to be reviving canceled games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, according to GB, Gameplay Group International acquires and reimagines “commercially unrealized games.” It was founded by Victor Lugo, who was for a time lead designer at Iron Galaxy working on Killer Instinct, and Philip Mayes, who was managing director of Australian games company Mighty Kingdom, which has a number of licensed games under its belt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay Group International, GB said it identifies games “with untapped potential and giving them a second life, refining gameplay and delivering polished, high-quality experiences for players worldwide. It’s giving games a second life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its initial slate is made up of fighting games. “I’ve long been frustrated seeing good games canceled or unable to find their audience,” Lugo said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While not all games can be saved, we look for diamonds in the rough and leverage our global network to bring them to completion, creating a win for everyone,” Mayes added. “Developers get to see their vision realised, and players get to play games they would otherwise have missed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game fits the profile. So what happened to it? It turns out it was in the works at Swedish firm Maximum Entertainment for some time before it was quietly canceled last year, according to a <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/a6d02489-03d2-4624-a052-18a3d85916bb/eng-me-interim-q32024-report-vf.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a>. The company never responded to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might remember Maximum Entertainment for its publishing label, Modus Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thems-fightin-herds-announces-end-of-development-immediately-hit-with-community-backlash">abruptly ceasing development on 2D fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds</a>, sparking a backlash from players. Maximum Entertainment has had a torrid time of it lately, with <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/maximum-entertainment-in-negotiations-with-lenders-following-covenant-breaches/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial problems</a>, <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/henrik-resmark-resigns-as-cfo-of-maximum-entertainment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive resignations</a>, and <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/maximum-entertainment-ab-has-filed-a-claim-against-former-board-members-of-the-company/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal action against former board members</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some relatively well known fighting game developers worked at Maximum Entertainment while it was developing this Avatar fighting game. The most high profile is Mike Zaimont, who was design director on fighting game Skullgirls. Zaimont, now design director at Maximum Entertainment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiple-lab-zero-games-employees-resign-following-studio-heads-inappropriate-behavior-and-abuse">was previously accused of sexual harassment while boss of Lab Zero Games</a>. He went on to work on Diesel Legacy: The Brazen Age, a 2v2 indie fighter from Modus Games (the same publisher of Them's Fightin' Herds). Gameplay Group International is now the publisher of Diesel Legacy and Them's Fightin' Herds, as well as Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Gameplay Group International has taken the Avatar fighting game Maximum Entertainment was working on and is trying to make a success of it. But there are still questions over the scope of the project. In the GB article, Mayes said GGI had two projects underway and could finance them, but over time it would need a cash injection. The hope, of course, is that Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game actually comes out this time and that it is good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When my colleague Marcus Stewart and I visited Obsidian Entertainment last month to check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/09/18/cover-reveal-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2 for the current <em>Game Informer </em>cover story</a>, we went in with one goal in mind: to find out if we can pet something, anything, in The Outer Worlds 2 (okay, and maybe to play the game and interview the team and find out why people should be excited about this expansive sequel).&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone, I come bearing good news: there are pets in The Outer Worlds 2, and yes, you can pet them.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you played The Outer Worlds back in 2019, you know Obsidian's luscious sci-fi world was filled with all kinds of oddities, from weapons to characters to locations to capitalistic tendencies to creatures. Until DLC was released post-launch, though, you couldn't have a pet in The Outer Worlds, despite all the fun creatures that would've been perfect as a pet (looking at you, Raptidon). That's changed with The Outer Worlds 2, as you can add pets to your galactic interloping family throughout the adventure, with multiple creatures (and even an automechanical) to choose from. Unfortunately, we couldn't wrestle out what creatures players can expect to befriend in The Outer Worlds 2 from Obsidian, but we did ask the team about this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have lots of different types of creatures in the game, " director Brandon Alder tells us. "We actually had a pretty enormous list that we went through and were like, 'Alright, which of these different NPCs or creatures do we want to take and convert into pets?'" Adler says players can expect to gain pets as request rewards, by finding them in the wild, or even as creatures available to purchase from vendors.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't expect your pets to run around places like Paradise Island with you, though. Adler says you can only have one active pet at a time and you select which pet you want to be active in your ship. From there, the pet will remain out and about in your ship, and it's here that you can pet them as much as you'd like. One of these pets can even be a Protectorate Drone, though they are "neutered" and won't have access to guns or ammunition as they fly around your ship.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxMY2RPERpQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxMY2RPERpQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"I think people just like having pets and petting them and having them along for the journey," Alder says. "You can get a whole bunch of them, but can only have one active at a time, and you choose which active pet you want in your ship and they stay on your ship. You can pet them, and no, they can't die – don't be cruel. Or be cruel, it's up to you."&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED has reached a new milestone with The Witcher. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">Not a sales milestone,</a> but a milestone nonetheless. In partnership with the other ESA (not the Entertainment Software Association, but the European Space Agency), two Witcher medallions came along with Polish astronaut Uznański-Wiśniewski on his trip to the International Space Station this past July. Essentially, he took The Witcher to outer space.</p>



<p>At least that's how CD Projekt RED puts it in its <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/blog/164/cd-projekt-red-and-esa-team-up-to-put-the-witcher-in-space">new blog post about the event</a>. The Wolf medallion worn by Geralt and the Lynx medallion worn by Ciri in the upcoming The Witcher 4 game are both key symbols for the franchise, so having Uznański-Wiśniewski carry them along with him to the ISS and take pictures with them on the station for posterity officially marks The Witcher making it to outer space.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve come a long way over the years, but seeing our </em><em>Witcher </em>medallions reach outer space is something else," said joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski. "<em>This is a huge honor, first of all, and we’re thankful to our collaboration with the European Space Agency for making it happen. It’s proof that Polish creativity and ambition can, quite literally, reach the stars.</em>"</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like Uznański-Wiśniewski was able to take along with him a means of playing The Witcher on the International Space Station, but the medallions taking the trip arguably has more symbolic importance and significance than if he used some of his leisure time to run around chasing after monsters as Geralt in anticipation of The Witcher 4.</p>



<p>"<em>No matter where I trained for my mission, everyone I spoke to with an interest in space, sci-fi, fantasy, and so on already knew about Poland — because of </em><em>The Witcher</em>," Uznański-Wiśniewski said. "<em>As the Wolf and Lynx medallions drifted in orbit, I saw more than symbols — I saw imagination made real. </em><em>The Witcher </em>reminds us that every frontier, whether on Earth or beyond, begins with the courage to dream of what’s next."</p>



<p>It's a significant, and just undeniably cool, that The Witcher made it into outer space in this way, or in any way, frankly. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-50-random-pokemon-cards-at-50-off-now-selling-for-mere-pennies-2000634615</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-50-random-pokemon-cards-at-50-off-now-selling-for-mere-pennies.1323643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Getting kids started with Pokemon card collecting can get expensive fast when you’re buying individual booster packs at the store for $5 to $7 each with only 10 cards inside. Building up enough cards to actually trade with friends or organize by type requires buying multiple packs and suddenly you’ve dropped $50 without even getting any rare cards.</p>
<p>Amazon just slashed <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">the price on their 50-card Pokemon bundle from $10 down to just $5, which works out to 10 cents per card</a>. This is the perfect starter pack for kids beginning their collection and (smart) parents are ordering four or five bundles at once to give their kids a substantial trading base right from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Random Pokemon Cards</h2>
<p>The <strong>set includes 50 cards randomly selected from all Pokemon series</strong> from the old beginning of the card game in the original 1999 base set to the new releases. The set will comprise a variety of Pokemon character cards with some old favorites like <em>Pikachu</em> and <em>Charizard</em> to new generations kids are accustomed to from existing games and television programs. The <strong>set includes Energy cards too</strong> which are required to play the game as opposed to collecting the cards.</p>



<p>The random nature of the selection makes each package different and builds anticipation as you open the package because you never quite know what you’ll be receiving. This element of mystery replicates the booster pack buying experience at the market but you’ll be receiving five times the number of cards for the same cost. The randomness keeps kids getting Pokemon from various evolutionary levels, types, and power levels to introduce them to the depth of the Pokemon universe as opposed to receiving multiple copies of the same handful of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates happen within one set </strong>or across sets if you buy a bunch of sets at one time. This is actually a benefit rather than a flaw for children assembling collections, since replicas become desirable trade material. When your kid has two or three of the same card, they can trade the spares with others who need that particular Pokemon to fill out their set or construct a superior deck. Learn the value of negotiation, social interaction, and value exchange within the context of something enjoyable, not educational.</p>



<p>Each of the Pokemon cards features the character’s hit points (HP), attacks with costs in energies along with values of damage, weaknesses, resistances, and retreat costs. The cards with energies show the single type with the Pokemon energies that the children recognize. The cards are the same size, girth and quality as cards found in booster packs that can be purchased at retailers.</p>
<p>Buying four or five bundles makes economic sense because 50 cards is actually the beginning of a serious collection. Buying four or five bundles puts kids right out of the gate with 200 to 250 cards that instantly put together a substantial-looking collection. They can then construct dozens of finished decks with different Pokemon types, a slew of duplicates with which to trade, yet still retain a display collection of their very favorites. At $5 per pack, buying five packs still costs a grand total of $25, the same as buying five single booster packs at the store that would net you the same 50 cards anyway.</p>
<p>For $5 rather than $10, this is the cheapest Amazon has ever sold this set at.</p>

<p>Every six months for the past several years, we've been sending out the call for reader recommendations that flag Switch games we've missed in the eShop flood. The sheer number of releases coming weekly throughout the Switch generation means there are plenty we simply weren't able to cover.</p>
<p>And with Switch 2 joining the ranks in the last six months, we imagine there'll be a few of those sneaking in when we return for another round in six months' time.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188793 @ 1760370139 -->
<p>Fortunately, Nintendo Life readers are on hand to send in suggestions for games they think deserve their flowers. This time, we've got 32 Switch games, old and new. We might not be able to vouch for them personally, but they've brought someone joy enough to write up a short recommendation, so take a scroll below and check out the trailers for a better idea.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sent their recommendations - there's a poll at the end to vote for the games here you've enjoyed the most. Let's crack on in <strong>alphabetical order</strong>, shall we?</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Pak-Man</strong> kicks things off this time: "Every city-builder fan needs to know about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm</a>." They've gone a <em>little</em> (a lot) over the word limit but, as you'll see, several readers have taken brevity to the extreme with their recommendations. So it all balances out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against the Storm is a fantasy city-builder with a "rainpunk" aesthetic. (It's always raining, and the type of rainy-season and collection of rainwater features prominently into your strategy.) You need to manage the needs and wants of the various species that have come to live in your city, raising their happiness so they'll become better workers, giving you the resources to build better things for them, and so on. The graphics are beautiful, the setting is captivating, and the music is wonderful.<br>
So far, so good. Where the game shines, though, was the decision to make it a roguelike.<br>
We're all tired of the word "roguelike" by now, but when it's applied to a city builder like this one, something incredible happens. I'm a long-time city-builder fan, and the momentum of those games always seems to die down once you get your city to a certain level of self-sustainability. You've built everything you want to build, your city is operating at key efficiency, what's left to do? The game becomes boring. This is where the roguelike element comes in. In Against the Storm, you're meeting the demands of a never-seen Queen. She'll send you missions and monitor the happiness of your citizens. Make her upset, or take too long to meet one of her demands, and it's game over. Time to start a new city. Make her happy enough, and it's also time to build a new city, but with some bonus materials and perks to take into your next city. This means you never quite reach that boring self-maintenance phase, and you're always in that exciting, "Time to get a new city off the ground" phase. In true Roguelike fashion, successful runs also give you the ability to unlock new permanent perks and buildings, so every new city is a little bit more complicated than the one before it. I've been playing it on PC for years now and it never gets old. I can't recommend it enough!</p>

<p><strong>Havenn</strong> goes nuclear for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atomicrops">Atomicrops</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a farming roguelike set on the last patch of fertile soil in a nuclear wasteland. You grow mutant corn, cabbages and more to feed a village outpost. At night, you’re tasked with protecting the plants from waves of hungry garden-themed bosses. There’s an eclectic mix of weapons, from spring-loaded leeches to potato grenade launchers – plus you can marry townspeople that will come defend the farm by your side! The game is tough-as-nails, but its bizarre pixel art and catchy pseudo-folk soundtrack along with dozens of collectible “Atomicats” have kept me coming back to play a run for years!</p>

<p>Just an ingenious new way of great storytelling. I wouldn't say earth-shattering but I'd say it's a unique spin on proven methods. And the art, characters and music really rise to meet the creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Joe Crane</strong> calls <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/barony">Barony</a> "amazing, a dungeon crawl with four-player split screen co op."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I play this every chance I get with my 8 and 6 year olds. We are waiting for my 4 year old to get a little older some can have a full team. My kids scream with excitement when Shelob appears and argue who gets Bilbos sword and ring if we manage to kill her. Since I'm playing with kids we are still learning things, locking spells work on mimics, lock picks disarm trapsnot just open chests, if you combine certain items with different classes you get different results andmuch more. There are over a dozen classes and about as many races to combine. I don't know why this game doesnt get more love, it is almost my most played game on my Switch and I am pretty sure it will end at the top sooner then later. Please check it out, this game deserves attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional collectibles double as bad jokes, as one expects from the creator of the Dadish series. The official description includes the phrase 'Questionable therapy' which doubles as the plot of the game. Extremely simple concept but fun and creative, with one bad jump flinging you off into the sky. Short cute levels, perfect if you just have a few minutes to play a game and want to use your brain a little but not too much.</p>

<p><strong>Munchlax</strong> rates Out of the Blue Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/call_of_the_sea">Call of the Sea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A narrative puzzle game by the developers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/american_arcadia">American Arcadia</a>, which sees terminally ill 1930’s housewife Nora journey to a Lovecraft-inspired take on Tahiti to search for her missing husband. The game essentially plays like a series of escape rooms, in fully 3D environments. Many of the puzzles are surprisingly complex, but are satisfying when you solve them. 5 hours long and fully voiced, it is worth the £16 asking price.</p>
</blockquote>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2 (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>topsekret</strong> has a thing for this TGC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would strongly recommend <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</a> to fans of TCGs and deck-building games! It's a digital version of the real-life TCG, Cardfight!! Vanguard.<br>
Dear Days 2 is a traditional RPG-style TCG game where there's a story and you naturally get more cards just by playing (no microtransactions). You could easily spend hundreds of hours testing out and perfecting your decks. While it is a sequel to the original Dear Days game (also available on Switch), you can definitely start with Dear Days 2, which has a much larger card pool.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>sketchturner</strong> has high praise for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat</a>, saying it's "easily one of the best puzzle games I've ever played."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though having a silly meme as a premise, it actually takes the concept and runs with it in genius ways.<br>
You control two "characters": a piece of buttered toast that can only jump, and a cat that can only walk. Together, they can fly. You have to use their abilities both separately and together to navigate increasingly brain-twisting levels.<br>
The levels start out easily approachable but turn into something where you feel like the smartest person on the planet once you solve it. Thankfully, levels are bite-sized challenges (often only one screen), so even when hard, they're never a marathon test of patience.<br>
The game introduces new mechanics in each world, which radically change the game and keep things fresh.<br>
This game is a formidable brain challenge for sure, but it always feels doable and the puzzles never feel redundant. Truly an overlooked gem!</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>FX29</strong> wants us to hit rewind on this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One game that fell under the radar is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind</a>. It's an action side scrolling game where you fight robots and you gotta use your reflexes along with memorising patterns. The game is basically a Mega Man Zero clone, the main character uses a sword like Zero and has a high difficulty similar to Mega Man Zero.<br>
It also has sands of time type gameplay where anytime you get hit the game lets you rewind time to before you get hit. Overall a fun but difficult game that should leave you satisfied until Capcom finally makes a new Mega Man game (fingers crossed).</p>

			<p>The Job System in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles offers unparalleled customization, but choosing the right Support Ability is critical for players focused on maximum Physical Damage. Here's the best Support Ability to maximize Physical Damage.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: Guide based on damage tests conducted in Enhanced Mode's Tactician difficulty, repeated three times under the same conditions to verify consistency. Although enemy stats and damage values differ in Knight and Squire difficulties, the findings from the tests show consistent damage differences. Screenshots captured from the up-to-date Steam version of the game as of October 13, 2025.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-all-support-abilities-that-boost-physical-damage">All Support Abilities That Boost Physical Damage</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Doublehand is one of the four Support Abilities that increase Physical Damage in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Ability Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Job</th><th>JP Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dual Wield</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a weapon in each hand, even if not a Ninja. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, allowing the unit to attack twice each turn.</td><td>Ninja</td><td>1,000 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Doublehand</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a single-handed weapon with both hands. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, greatly increasing (2x) their attack power.</td><td>Samurai</td><td>900 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attack Boost</strong></td><td>Increase the unit's physical attack power (33% bonus)</td><td>Geomancer</td><td>400 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brawler</strong></td><td>Delivers more powerful bare-handed attacks, even if not a Monk.</td><td>Monk</td><td>450 JP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-best-physical-damage-support-ability">The Best Physical Damage Support Ability</h2>



<p>If you are only interested in the definitive answer to maximize your unit's physical damage with the basic Attack command, here is the conclusion based on the extensive testing: <strong>Dual Wield is the best Support Ability for maximum Physical Damage as soon as you can deal 500 damage consistently in a single hit</strong>  If your unit is not yet hitting high damage totals, Doublehand and Barehanded damage with a Monk with high Bravery and Dual Wield Support Ability are better choices.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Best Support Ability</th><th>Key Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Absolute Maximum Damage</strong></td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>Allows two hits of up to 999 damage, resulting in maximum 1998 total damage, bypassing the single-hit cap.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High-Level/Pre-Cap Damage</strong></td><td>Doublehand</td><td>Maximizes the power of your single best weapon, providing a higher overall damage multiplier until you consistently hit 500+ damage.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Barehanded Damage </strong>(Monk+Dual Wield Support Ability)</td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>A Monk's innate Brawler works on both barehanded strikes from Dual Wield, exceeding damage dealt by weapons the Ninja can natively equip.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Physical Skill</strong>s (Martial Arts, Holy Sword, Swordplay, Unyielding Blade)</td><td>Attack Boost</td><td>Applies the damage bonus to nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Holy Sword), which Dual Wield and Doublehand do not.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-testing-methodology">Testing Methodology</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Minotaur monster used as a test dummy</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To conclude that Doublehand and a Monk using the Dual Wield ability are better choices before being able to hit an enemy for more than 500 damage in a single hit, I conducted some tests in a random battle set in the Zeklaus Desert map, using my level 55 Ramza with 97 Bravery right before the final gauntlet of battles at Orbonne Monastery in late Chapter 4. The enemy used as a test dummy was a Level 49 Virgo Minotaur, which had neutral compatibility with my Ramza's Aries Zodiac sign.</p>

<p>While Attack Boost provides the lowest damage increase for the basic Attack command, it is invaluable for abilities that scale with Physical Attack. It applies a 33% bonus to the Physical Attack stat, resulting in a damage bonus for nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Jump, Holy Sword, Swordplay, and Unyielding Blade), where Dual Wield and Doublehand have no effect.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3's cast has been widely acclaimed since the game's release, from Neil Newbon's award-winning role as Astarion to Tim Downie (of <a href="https://paddingtonbear.fandom.com/wiki/Montgomery_Clyde" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://paddingtonbear.fandom.com/wiki/Montgomery_Clyde">Paddington fame</a>) as Gale. But how would the characters--no, not the actors--do if they were auditioning for a <em>different </em>role in the game? We thought that sounded like a great idea, so we got some of the fan-favorite cast together and, potentially under duress, had them audition for new roles.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm Gale of Waterdeep, and I am going to be reading for the role of Lae … of Lae'zel," Downie said. "I smell their blood on you, still! I smell your sweat!"Given that Gale is quite polite and a cat dad, it's tough to imagine him ever having Lae'zel's bloodlust, not to mention her sexual forwardness. That being said, we would very much like an entire game where that is exactly what we get.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Astarion as Shadowheart? BG3 Cast Tries New Roles!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Neil Newbon's Astarion, meanwhile, read for the role of Shadowheart, with Jennifer English standing by his side and physically forcing him to kneel: Kneel Newbon. Astarion seemed less than thrilled with the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am auditioning for the role of Shadowheart, under no duress … of my own free … free will," he said, while looking up at English to make sure he hadn't done something wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best was Wyll actor Theo Solomon's turn as Minsc--a ranger who, if he were a cat, would definitely be orange.</p><p dir="ltr">"No, Boo! The druid did not beat Minsc at arm wrestling! It is not fair match!" Solomon said. "And he turned into an Owlbear midway through, and there was grease on the tree stump!"</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Boo" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Boo">Boo</a> is, of course, Minsc's "miniature giant space hamster" who is <em>definitely </em>not just a regular hamster that gets swapped out every few years when the last one dies.</p><p dir="ltr">Jennifer English's turn as Astarion and his meme-worthy "full concentrated power of the sun" line--which may have been a Megamind Easter egg--just might be our favorite line-reading. Shadowheart, who is not a vampire, also has much less to fear about the sun itself, so her recasting as Astarion might make the game a little easier!</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/">GameSpot's GOTY for 2023</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is due out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">this coming Thursday, October 16, 2025,</a> and ahead of that launch, massive leaks are already starting to appear online. <a href="https://x.com/3clipse_tt">X (formerly Twitter) user 3clipse_tt</a> claims to have accessed an early build of the game and has been posting clips from what they've discovered, showing mechanics and features not in the final version. Another user, <a href="https://x.com/PokeVerse93">PokeVerse93</a>, is posting the full Pokédex to X (formerly Twitter).</p>



<p>And, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/spoiler-warning-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-have-started-ahead-of-its-release/">VGC</a>, you can head to Twitch, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/search?term=pokemon%20legends%20z-a">including at the time of this writing</a>, and find users livestreaming the game.</p>



<p>Needless to say, if you're excited to play Pokémon Legends: Z-A and don't want to be spoiled on things like new Pokémon being introduced, new mega evolutions, and what you're missing out on because Nintendo and The Pokémon Company decided not to include it in the final game, stay away from the above links.</p>



<p>Earlier this year in July, we got our last major look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A with <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-story-trailer-pokemon-friends-pokemon-champions/">a new story trailer that debuted at a Pokémon Presents event</a>. We also got the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle for the game, which, if how Nintendo treated limited editions of the original Nintendo Switch is anything to go by, will surely be followed by a special, Pokémon Legends: Z-A-themed Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is also, unsurprisingly, the best place to play Legends: Z-A, as it is said to include "<em>improved graphics</em> <em>and frame rates</em>" compared to the version on the original Nintendo Switch. We'll see when it arrives, though, if that means that on Switch 2, Legends: Z-A runs at an acceptable, albeit low, frame rate, while on Switch 1, it runs like a slideshow. </p>

<p>Up until this point, the few thumbs down I've earned from stillalive studios' latest bout of bus simulation have been due to my own carelessness. I've mounted the occasional curb, forgotten to stop at stop signs, and occasionally engaged in a bit of touring car-esque paint trading with my fellow road users. This time, I don't think it's my fault. There are cars strewn across the junction, blocking any ability myself and the distressed merger before me might have to obey the green light being pointed our way.</p>
<p>I sound the horn. Come on, its pathetic call tells everyone else stuck in the gridlock, I've got a timetable to keep. No one moves. I look at the list of stops left on the route I've drawn up by connecting various stops around the suburban American city of Emberville. Next up is 99th Street. Get us there, urge the disgruntled passengers. I'd tell them to eff off because there's nothing I can do. I'd tell them to eff off because they haven't paid. I can't though, because in order to circumvent simulating the art of giving someone a dirty look when they try to pay for a £3 bus fare with a £20 note, the method by which my bussing success is measured is likes and dislikes.</p><p>The myriad whims of public opinion are the be-all-and-end-all in this cashless corner of the world's most openly capitalism-loving nation. It's a utopia in which local councils actually get funding and dedicate it to getting strong public transport links up and running. It's an uber-utopia in which that investment's followed up by renovation of city neighbourhoods once you've bussed through them regularly enough and earned the approval of their citizens. The works to improve these areas aren't farmed out to a third-party contractor corporation who respond to getting lucrative government contracts because they've agreed to appoint a cabinet minister to their board by taking a millenium to do the work.</p>

<p>It's beautiful, and far too good to be true. It also dilutes the sim's appeal a bit in my mind. In opting to specifically simulate bus driving, you're putting all of your eggs in that basket. Were Bus Bound more of a generalist sim, or even a bus-centric add-on to an existing one as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches SCS Software are working on adding to their truck sims</a>, I'd be more forgiving of it not getting as into the nitty gritty of commuting capital. As it is, Bus Bound's more of a straightforward city driving sim whose routes happen to run between bus stops. That does make it a lot easier to get the hang of, and there is plenty of challenge in resisting the urge to drive like an idiot, disregarding the rules of the road like they're nothing.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the AI traffic do a convincing job of simulating the real thing, even down to being receptive of your indicators. It's hard to have an accident that isn't your fault, usually because you didn't check after stopping at a junction or forgot the buses don't have the same stopping distance as your average circuit racer. The city's a vibrant enough backdrop that repeated runs through the same streets didn't get too stale, at least through  the end of the demo hour. The few real-world buses on offer for Next Fest have a decent amount of paint customisation on offer. I'll have to wait until the full thing's out to be allowed behind the wheel of a double decker, but that's fair.</p><p>Having tried the demo, which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2095420/Bus_Bound/">Bus Bound's Steam page</a>, I've enjoyed its laid back vibes. On the other hand, I'm not sure at this point whether it'll have the sim depth to keep folks around in the long run and carve out a place among the genre's leaders, especially if they're offering coach trips with a bit of real world tourism mixed in. We'll have to see when its 2026 release rolls around.</p>

              <p>Amazon noticed there wasn’t much happening in October. September has Labor Day, November has Black Friday, but October was always quiet. That’s why it created its own shopping holiday: Prime Big Deal Days. The event officially ran from October 7 to 8, but even though it’s over, many of the best deals are still live. From lawnmowers and vacuums to laptops, Amazon seems in no rush to pull those discounts just yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">This Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop has a pretty affordable starting price to begin with at $350. For the sale, Amazon has chopped off 20% which saves you a whopping $70. That brings the price you pay down to just $280.</a></p>
<p>So what’s this laptop working with? The Acer Aspire Go is powered by an 8-core, Intel Core 3 processor N355 with an integrated Intel graphics. It’s got 8GB of memory an 128GB of UFS storage. It’s a great little workhorse designed for browsing the internet, sending emails, and writing up Word docs. Sorry, you’ll have to go with something a little more powerful if you’re looking to play CyberPunk 2077 in ultra-high settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable and User-Friendly</h2>
<p>The laptop measures in at 15.6 inches with a super narrow bezel to maximize the screen real estate while keeping the computer compact. It displays in a resolution of up to 1080p Full HD which is plenty at that size. For bouts where you’re find yourself on the laptop for multiple hours at a time, you can turn on Acer BluelightShield. This reduces the levels of blue light to help less the effects of blue light exposure. Keep your eyes from feeling strained so you can get your work finished up.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, you have a number of different ports along the sides of the Acer Aspire 15. Along the left, you’ll find two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and an HDMI 2.1 slot so you can display on a second monitor. On the right side, you have one more USB-A port so you can connect to wired accessories like a mouse or external SSD. The laptop has Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support so you can utilize fast internet speeds when on a Wi-Fi 6 network.</p>
<p>Video call with colleagues, family or friends thanks to the on-board 720p HD web camera. It can capture high-quality footage even in low light conditions, plus can reduce noise and amplify your voice using AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4730/">Right now, Amazon has the Acer Aspire 15 slim laptop on sale for just $280 even after Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>LEGO Star Wars sets have become hot collectibles that fly off shelves even among people who’ve never seen a single movie. The appeal goes way beyond fandom: these are legitimate display pieces that look expensive sitting on a desk or shelf, and they provide hours of meditative building that actually helps you unwind after work.</p>
<p>This particular <em>Millennium Falcon</em> model celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Lego Star Wars line has a perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars from nearly 1,800 reviews and ranks as one of Amazon’s best-selling sets even at full price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Amazon has dropped it from $84 to just $67, which is the lowest price this set has ever been</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Star Wars LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of the gigantic 7,500-piece LEGO sets that occupies half your dining room table for a month: The <strong>build with 921 pieces is big enough to be a true project but small enough that you can tackle it over a long weekend</strong> or a couple of easy evenings. The completed model is <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> which is a nice size to sit nicely on a bookshelf.</p>
<p>The model builds the Millennium Falcon as seen in <em>A New Hope</em> with true-to/detail features such as the characteristic cockpit offset to the right side of the vessel, the disc-shaped satellite dish resting on top, and the four-laser cannons placed at the upper and lower panels. The plates of the exterior embody the worn, lived-in appearance of the galaxy’s fastest hunk of junk with the greebling and textured panels that give depth and realism to the classic saucer form.</p>



<p>The included display stand is what elevates this from a toy to a legitimate decorative piece: The stand angles the ship at a dynamic tilt that makes it look like it’s banking through space during a chase sequence. This angled presentation adds visual interest and creates the impression of motion, which is way more engaging than a flat horizontal display. The stand includes a printed nameplate that reads <em>“Millennium Falcon”</em> along with a special 25th Anniversary Lego Star Wars commemorative brick, marking this as part of the anniversary collection.</p>
<p>In the $67 rather than $84 range, this offers a 20% savings as the lowest price this anniversary set has seen since release.</p>

              <p>It’s easy to feel cramped up when you’re working or gaming on a single screen. An easier (and cheaper) solution than upgrading your entire setup is to add a second display, and bonus points if it’s portable. The 15.6-inch MNN portable monitor is an excellent option to consider for this, and right now, you don’t have to pay the full price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">It was already quite affordable at $90, but currently it sits at just $60 on Amazon after a 33% discount.</a> This discount is a limited-time one, so act fast to grab it while the offer is still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Slim, Portable Build With Impressive Visuals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS panel, which is the same as many full-sized laptop screens. Resolution pushes to 1920×1080 for a sharp, vibrant display, regardless of what you’re using it for. Visuals are pretty much consistent from any angle, and the matte finish helps cut down on reflections, so using it in brighter settings won’t be a problem. And since these specs match what you’ll find on many built-in laptop screens, you really won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between your main display and this one.</p>
<p>There are also multiple display modes for different tasks. We’re talking Extended Mode for a larger screen space, Second Screen Mode for a dual-monitor setup, Portrait Mode to use it as a vertical display, and more. Maybe go with the extended option while playing a game, and the portrait mode when you’re reading something!</p>



<p>Connectivity options include two full-feature USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port, meaning you can connect it to your laptop, PC, smartphone, tablet, MacBook, gaming console, or even a Switch. Just note that your device needs to support USB-C DP Alt Mode or HDMI output. If it does, a single USB-C cable that comes included in the box should be enough to handle both power and video.</p>
<p>The monitor itself is quite lightweight and easy to carry around. You’re also getting a scratch-proof smart cover made of durable PU leather exterior. It not only protects the screen from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand that you can use to easily prop the monitor up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">Altogether, this is quite an affordable option to consider if you’ve been wanting to invest in a second screen that works with a range of devices</a>. It goes with you wherever you go, and there are no compromises on the visual quality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light’s developers have said that the game’s combat and physicality are inspired by Daniel Craig’s era of Bond movies. </p>



<p>It seems that Daniel Craig and his Bond movies have been a major inspiration for IO Interative’s upcoming origin story, 007 First Light. The developers had previously stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-used-daniel-craigs-likeness-for-first-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor’s head was placed on Agent 47’s body</a> for the first demo. Now, the developers have revealed that the game’s other aspects are inspired by the movies this actor appeared in. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-draws-inspiration-from-casino-royale-s-style-of-movement">007 First Light Draws Inspiration from Casino Royale’s Style of Movement</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.edge-magazine-subscription.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-studio-didnt-want-to-create-this-superman-from-day-one-with-its-fresh-faced-james-bond-its-not-very-relatable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Creative Director Hakan Abrak spoke about drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era for 007 First Light. Abrak first stated that it isn’t “one-to-one exactly,” as the dev team is trying to make the game “feel original.” However, the team found it essential that the character is constantly “moving, dynamic and acrobatic, almost like the parkour at the start of Casino Royale.”</p>



<p>While talking about drawing inspiration from these movies, Abrak also spoke about not creating “this superman from day one” where the character is already “on top of the world, and he’s hardened and seasoned, and he’s had his heartbreaks and now he’s hidden behind this iron armor.” The developers feel it won’t be “interesting” to players and provided an example of 1962’s Dr. No, which features Bond already as this super agent, which is “not very relatable”. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemma Chan has been confirmed</a> among the cast for 007 First Light. Additionally, the developers have insisted that the upcoming title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a Hitman “reskin</a>“.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 has been out on PC and consoles for three days at the time of this writing, and already, players are getting frustrated with the XP grind to unlock new weapons and attachments. So, players have turned to an old workaround for Battlefield games: create a custom server in Portal, and farm XP in bot matches. EA, for its part, is trying to stop players from boosting by shutting down the more popular farms, but players can always make new ones.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-6-fast-xp-farms-progression-times-portal-ea-response">VG247</a>, a select few Portal servers were popularized when YouTubers and content creators began making videos with titles like "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5Df2dvxC0"><em>How to Unlock Weapons, Attachments, Gadgets, and Soldiers Faster in Battlefield 6</em>.</a>" Players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4n1c3/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> were also sharing codes to let other players find their XP-farming servers, as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5f660/weapon_attachments/">community has seemingly rallied around the feeling</a> that earning XP for weapons, attachments, gadgets, and soldiers is <em>"ridiculously slow</em>."</p>



<p>In response to players using Portal for XP farming, EA seems to be shutting down the more popular servers, and players are now running into error messages telling them that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5emdf/biggest_shit_take_of_all_launch/">EA's servers "<em>are at max capacity</em>," </a>stopping players from creating new servers.</p>



<p>Of course, this won't last forever, and EA can't exactly play an endless game of whack-a-mole with Portal servers to try and stop everyone from doing any amount of XP farming. It's also not like Battlefield 6 is the first Battlefield game where players have turned to Portal for this exact reason.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">Even in our review</a> of Battlefield 6, we noted that the grind for weapons and attachments, specifically those that can only be unlocked through certain situational challenges, wasn't something we particularly liked, even if it can be seen as a way of changing up the tried-and-true method of just levelling up your character and weapon to unlock everything. </p>



<p>Since theoretically, you could jump into matches and focus on only completing those challenges where possible. But that's not exactly the way to play if you're just trying to have a good time in Battlefield 6, or any multiplayer game, for that matter.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll see EA stop its whack-a-mole game and adjust some of the situational challenges and XP requirements so that players can unlock what they want, without too much hassle, and the game can find its meta more naturally. Rather than it becoming a case of 'players who farmed XP in Portal vs. players who didn't,' and since only one of those sides is going to have better and more weapons, attachments, and gadgets available to them, it's pretty clear which side is coming out on top.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-2000634598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ecoflow-power-station-sells-out-every-hurricane-season-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies.1323541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during hurricane season, winter storms knocking out electricity for days or those rolling blackouts during summer heatwaves – these aren’t rare anymore, they’re becoming the new normal. Having a reliable backup power source is now essential for keeping your family safe and comfortable when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">price on the 1,800W EcoFlow Delta 2 from $699 to $429</a>, which makes it the lowest price we’ve ever tracked for this powerhouse portable power station that <strong>can run 90% of your household appliances</strong>. This is the unit that sells out every time severe weather hits and right now you can grab it at 39% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Power Station</h2>
<p>The EcoFlow Delta 2 is equipped with a <strong>1024-watt-hour LiFePO4 battery that has 1800W of continuous AC power</strong> through four standard wall outlets. That 1800-watt power rating puts it in a whole different class compared to smaller power stations because it can power high-draw appliances such as space heaters, power tools, electric grills, and even clothes washers.</p>
<p>The unit achieves a <strong>surge capacity of up to 2700 watts to power the initial surge</strong> of power with motor-driven appliances turning on so that your refrigerator or air conditioner kicks on without a hiccup. LiFePO4 chemistry is capable of over <strong>3000 full charge cycles until the battery degrades to 80% capacity</strong>, which equates to about 10 years of day use. This is six times longer compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries used within lower-cost power stations.</p>



<p>The charging speed on this device is completely nuts: The <strong>Delta 2 reaches 80% from zero in 50 minutes</strong> and 100% in 80 minutes with a standard wall outlet. That’s seven times as fast as previous EcoFlow products and enables you to get disaster backup power virtually instantly when storms are looming. The product feeds 1200 watts of AC input to the battery and that’s why it charges that quickly. The fans do run noisier during this fast charging mode and reaches approximately 58 decibels, but the charging speed can be lowered with the EcoFlow app to minimize noise if you are charging overnight.</p>
<p>The front panel is flush<strong> with 15 assorted outlets</strong>: You’ve got four AC outlets that together carry a rating of 1800 watts, two USB-C ports each carrying 100 watts of power (capable of fast-charging two MacBook Pros simultaneously), four USB-A with assorted speeds including two capable of 18-watt fast charging, one 12-volt auto outlet ideal for items such as portable coolers, and one DC5521 output port.</p>



<p>The LCD display shows real-time power input and output in watts, remaining battery percentage and estimated runtime based on your current load. This makes it easy to see exactly how much juice you have left and plan accordingly. The <em>EcoFlow</em> app adds remote control functionality and allows you to monitor power usage from anywhere, adjust charging speeds, and control connected outlets even when you’re not near the unit. The app also provides detailed energy consumption statistics so you can see which devices are draining the battery fastest.</p>
<p>The <strong>unit weighs 27 pounds</strong> which is heavier than the smaller capacity power stations yet light enough to be lifted with one hand with the heavy-duty built-in handle. The compact unit doesn’t occupy much floor space, and the top is level to easily stack items on top of it or store it away under a desk. The power station functions in extreme temperatures as well as features advanced battery management with 62 different protective features that <strong>watch temperature, voltage, current, and other vitals to ensure that everything stays within the safety range</strong>.</p>
<p>At $429 instead of $699, this is a 39% off deal and the lowest price that this power station has ever reached on Amazon. As with these units, they always seem to run out of stock during natural disasters when everyone wakes up as one to the sudden realization that they could use some backup power, so don’t delay waiting until the next hurricane watch to come to a decision.</p>
