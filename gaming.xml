			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/blades-of-fire/noticias/trabajadores-mercurysteam-algo-hace-bien-mercury-jugar-miedo-porque-no-hay-otro-lugar-donde-ir-industria">Spanish publication 3DJuegos</a> points to poor working conditions at MercurySteam, the studio behind Metroid Dread, and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire, which launched earlier this year</a>. The report includes interviews with both current and former members of MercurySteam's development team, who claim that the studio was mandating overtime that should have been voluntary, and that a crunch culture has been established where an eight-hour-a-day work week is an easy week compared to the new 10-hour normal.</p>



<p>According to the report, these issues began before the launch of Blades of Fire, with a new work schedule implemented called "<em></em><em>Distribucion Irregular de la Jornada</em> <em>(DIJ)</em>," which essentially meant teams within MercurySteam would be subjected to longer hours, but the overtime compensation was never directly made clear. It was also never actually mandatory, with the company's HR department admitting, after employees poked holes in the new system's implementation, that these hours were not actually mandatory.</p>



<p>According to one of the interviewed employees (<a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/mercurysteam-employees-speak-out-10-hour-workdays-unclear-policie/za879b">via translation</a>), "<em>At first, they said the extra hours were completely mandatory, without distinguishing between the DIJ hours and the new ones, and they talked about the need for overtime as if we were in some kind of crisis. They used exaggerated language to describe the company's situation, but also to cover up the fact that they were proposing unstructured and unregulated measures. They told us overtime would be assigned as needed, even though overtime legally has to be recorded and agreed upon by both parties, and there was no system in place for that</em>."</p>



<p>This new DIJ schedule was also reportedly not something that MercurySteam kept a record of, at least on paper. From the management's mouth to the employees' ears was how members of the studio learned they were on this new schedule, which has meant a new normal of 10-hour work weeks for some teams. But, critically, not for others, as some teams have yet to be submitted to the new work schedule, while others have reportedly rarely been taken off of it.</p>



<p>Issues of crunch were only exacerbated when Blades of Fire released and failed to hit sales expectations, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteams-blades-of-fire-deemed-to-have-underperformed">game's publisher publicly saying the game had "<em>underperformed</em>."</a> By that point, as teams had been crunching for months to get the game out the door, the crunch hours had become a normalized state for some developers. The report also claims that by August 2025, developers at the studio had started to get laid off, with some teams shrinking, though, once again, not all teams were treated equal, as others kept hiring.</p>



<p>Internal communications between employees have also reportedly been largely shut down, with non-work-related chats closed, and partitions set up around the office. The layoffs, crunch culture, and mixing messages from HR have all participated to a low point for employee morale, as the studio's future remains uncertain. Still, though, they are reportedly crunching on the studio's next project, which is currently unannounced.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ROG Xbox Ally X: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-kotaku-review.1325923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is an Xbox? It’s a question that’s only been asked twice in human history. The first time was in 2001 when engineers at Microsoft turned PC components into a home console. The second time is now, as Microsoft moves beyond that hardware to new frontiers to fuel its now-gargantuan game publishing apparatus. One of those frontiers is PC gaming handhelds, and the ROG Xbox Ally X is the first flag planted clumsily in that soil. It’s a step in the right direction but not a convincing one. It’s a half-measure at best, and one that will give you sticker shock.</p> <p>Lets get this out of the way: The ROG Xbox Ally X costs $1,000. That gets you an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, 8GB of extra memory, and an 80wh battery compared to the $600 Xbox Ally model’s Z2 A processor, smaller memory, smaller battery, and smaller storage (512GB of SSD instead of 1TB). Microsoft only sent me the Ally X for review, so I can’t tell you how the two match up or if the upgrade is worth it. What I can tell you is that $1,000 is a lot to spend on any handheld, especially a PC gaming one that still feels this compromised.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635719"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635719">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s more than double the price of a Switch 2, and $450 more than the base Steam Deck OLED. At just 7 inches, the 1080p, 120Hz screen is still smaller than both of those cheaper alternatives. The new Asus-manufactured handheld, like the original models, still comes with an enormous bezel that makes it look like a cheap tablet. Nothing about the Ally X shell, the flexing of the screen when you press down on it, or the density of the components inside gives the feeling of a luxury gaming device.</p>

 <p>It does feel surprisingly light and comfortable in my hands, though. It’s one of the heaviest handhelds around at 1.57 pounds but the distribution of the weight makes it hardly feel noticeable. The new Xbox controller-like paddles on the ends are far and away the biggest improvement the Ally X makes. They look silly. They&nbsp;<em>are</em> silly. They are also the most comfortable built-in grips of any handheld I’ve played. The biggest letdown, on the other hand, might be the new modified Windows OS.</p>

 <h2>A pricey Xbox skin over a familiar Windows experience</h2> <p>The Xbox Ally X has a unique job and it doesn’t do it particularly well. Its central task is to organize all of your PC games from all of your different launchers in one easy-to-navigate menu that lets you swap between them like your tabbing across the Xbox console dashboard. Bonus points for the Xbox Ally X being a portable device that lets you play the biggest blockbuster releases on decent-to-good settings from the comfort of your couch, bed, or anywhere else that isn’t the desktop PC you already spend too much time ruining your posture in front of. The Ally X gets a decent grade on the latter. Unfortunately, it mostly bungles the former.</p>

 <p>Out of the box, the handheld is still very much a Windows device. Only after a couple hours of me fiddling around with downloads and updates did the Ally X have everything it needed to launch the full-screen Xbox experience. That’s the device’s main selling point, at least until the modified OS ships to other PC gaming handhelds in early 2026, and it’s not a great sign that it doesn’t turn on the first time with it ready to go for October 16 launch.</p>   <p>Once installed, you never have to think about Windows again, except for every time there’s an error screen, or you switch to one of the non-Xbox launchers like Steam or the Epic Games Store. Games that require you to log into a separate company’s portal to access them also interrupt the experience. Playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Steam required opening the Valve-owned storefront followed by the proprietary CD Projekt Red launcher followed by the actual game’s main menu. Not all of it is Microsoft’s fault, but it’s just one example of the limits of the more gamer-friendly version of Windows the company is touting.</p>

 <p>Credit where it’s due: there are some really cool features here. The Ally X comes with a dedicated Xbox home button. Pressing it pulls up a cross-bar where you can quickly access shortcuts for recently played games, the main storefronts and launchers, and a bunch of settings menus and gameplay capture tools to tinker around with. Hold the Xbox button down and you’ll pull up each window that’s currently active on the device. You can toggle between these with the touchscreen or the bumpers and then quickly close any of them out by holding down the “X” face button. The sleep mode also works nicely. Press the power button and the screen goes off. Press it again 12 hours later, enter your pass code, and your game will be right where you left it.</p>

 <h2>Near console-like game performance</h2> <p>These are the parts of the Ally X that remind me of the best parts of the Xbox Series X/S. Quick Resume was a small addition this console generation with a big impact. Microsoft’s consoles store suspended states for multiple games so that you can quickly swap between them without having to do all the laborious work of saving, shutting them down, and starting them back up again. You can see hints of that innovative thinking in the Ally X’s retrofitted gaming layer for Windows, but it feels incomplete right now. It’s less a deep tissue renovation than a fresh coat of paint that missed some spots and is already peeling in others.</p> <p>Let’s talk about games for a second. I’m not here to do benchmark analysis. I played everything from <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to recent smaller hits like <em>Consume Me</em> and <em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>and they all ran somewhere between good enough and great. On big-budget AAA releases I could get around 40fps on medium graphics settings or higher with frame-generation. Performance and visual detail was consistent and nothing ever crashed on me. At the same time, there was never a moment of “Wow, I can’t believe [insert game here] looks this good in my hands!” Anything from <em>Hades</em> <em>2</em> or<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on down runs perfectly, and truth be told I spent most of my time playing indie games from Game Pass and Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635737"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635737">Forgive me for all the smudges. I have three kids.</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s part of the conundrum of considering a $1,000 PC gaming handheld. Sure, you can run through bombed out buildings, land some kill shots, and take objectives in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. Despite the great ergonomics and dutiful performance, however, this isn’t where I want to spend most of my time playing that type of game. The same goes for cinematic blockbusters like <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. These Sony exclusives are technically available for the first time ever on an Xbox-branded device. Still, I’d prefer to bask in those worlds on console or desktop (also there was some weird visual hitching in<em> Spider-Man 2</em> that I couldn’t quite figure out how to fix). The Ally X might be the closest to replicating a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming experience in a handheld thus far, but it doesn’t quiet feel revelatory enough to justify the jump yet.</p>

 <p>That leaves two alternatives. The Ally X is either a $1,000 box to play $20 indie games you can run on the 8-year-old Switch, or it’s a pricey accessory that extends the traditional PC and console gaming experience beyond a single room and screen. The Ally X is surprisingly good in that role. Cloud data syncs seamlessly back and forth between it and other devices you can play your library on, and cloud gaming runs smoothly enough to be a meaningful option for accessing a vast library of Xbox console games that aren’t natively available on PC, even if it’s still far from being a satisfying solution.</p> <h2>The Steam-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>Microsoft has updated some PC games in its store to have little badges that let you know how well they’ll work on the Xbox Ally handhelds. For whatever reason, though, there are plenty of listings, including <em>Minecraft</em>, that still don’t mention it at all.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is “handheld optimized.” <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is “mostly compatible.”<em> Silent Hill F</em> warns to “check minimum requirements.”<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, meanwhile, will “perform great on your device.”</p>

 <p>What checking for these little badges really drove home for me, however, is just how many games aren’t available in Microsoft’s PC gaming store at all. Even if you want to stay in its ecosystem as much as possible, you’ll still have to venture to other storefronts for big games like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. And these store pages offer no help or promises for how the games will run on Ally X, in addition to making you deal with the still-cumbersome process of swapping between the Xbox hub and places like Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635724">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For all its neat ideas, perhaps the most damning thing about the experience of actually navigating the Ally X is how none of the new, Xbox-centric modifications make it feel nearly as good as Steam Big Picture mode, which would occasionally accidentally take over my screen when I pressed the wrong combination of buttons. When that happened, my eyes would immediately relax. The controls immediately felt snappier. Even on the Ally X, Steam still feels like it’s winning the PC gaming handheld race. It left me pining more for what the $1,000 version of a Steam Deck might look like than what a more seamless, feature-complete Windows gaming experience could be.</p> <p>I went into my time reviewing the Ally X hoping it would check all of the boxes and become the unquestionable standard bearer for gaming in this form factor. Instead, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who doesn’t already have a massive Microsoft PC gaming library, or have their heart set on being a guinea pig for a Windows gaming experiment that’s still very much a work-in-progress. What is an Xbox? I’m not sure anymore. But it’s definitely not the Ally X. At least not yet.</p>

              <p><span>Now and then, a patch adds something that makes you wonder how it got through testing. Most competitive game fans pore over patch notes, combing through every change to make sure their favorite fighting game or hero shooter is “fair” and skill-based. Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fgc-fighting-game-tournament-wawa-child-1849165232"><i><span>Dragon Ball FighterZ</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-patch-notes-140"><span>new patch</span></a><span> last week, and even if you don’t play Arc System Works’ anime fighter, you should see this absolutely dirty new tech for one of its many Goku variants.</span></p> <p><span>Goku Ultra Instinct is one of the five playable versions of the </span><i><span>Dragon Ball </span></i><span>protagonist in </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span>, and it’s the Saiyan at his most powerful. This blue-haired Goku has an ability that lets him sidestep to the other side of an opponent whenever they’re hitstunned, which allows you to extend combos by moving to where your opponent is not guarding. However, if you pair it with assist moves from your teammates, you can essentially string together an unblockable, never-ending combo.</span></p>   <p><span>On one hand, it is lore accurate. Folks on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonballfighterz/comments/1o4crsq/what_the_actual_fuck_ultra_instinct_goku_patch_140/"><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span> subreddit</span></a><span> are calling the maneuver “aura farming,” even though it seems like an absolute balance nightmare. It’s funny to watch, but I can’t imagine trying to play against it without losing my cool.</span></p>   <p><span>The block mechanics of most fighting games require you to push your stick or d-pad in the opposite direction of an incoming attack, which means players must often rely on mixups to get past an enemy’s stonewalled defense. Moves like this one allow you to quickly get behind an enemy, bypassing their current guard input and punching through their defenses. Normally, there’s some kind of drawback to these moves so an opponent has counterplay against them, but if that exists here, it doesn’t look like </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span> players have found it yet.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is here and launched with over half a dozen game modes such as Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush, and Domination. But just because there are plenty of options for players right now, it doesn’t mean that EA isn’t working on bringing more game modes to Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>According to data obtained by Insider Gaming, there are six more game modes possibly joining Battlefield 6 at some point in the near future. The strings were found in the multiplayer files of the game. The lines read:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Raid/Mode/MUT_Raid </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Payload/Mode/MUT_Payload </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Sabotage/Mode/MUT_Sabotage</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/SquadShootout/Mode/MUT_SquadShootout</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Strikepoint/Mode/MUT_Strikepoint</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/TankHunt/Mode/MUT_TankHunt</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6. Looking at the strings found shows modes called “Raid”, “Payload”, “Sabotage”, “Squad Shootout”, “Strikepoint”, and “TankHunt”. </p>



<p>Two modes that players know are coming on October 28 are Strikepoint and Sabotage. Strikepoint is planned to launch on October 28 alongside the release of Battlefield 6 Season 1: Rogue Ops. Sabatage will come on November 18 as part of Season 1: California Resistance. </p>



<p>Other modes found in the data haven’t been mentioned or confirmed by EA as of writing. Still, with them already in the files, it could be only a matter of time before more details are made public as new seasons get announced. Either way, it’s something to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for just a few days, and it’s one of the most well-reviewed games in the series since 2016’s Battlefield 1. In his review of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill says</a> that the game’s multiplayer offering is “enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up” and that there’s “plenty of juice in the tank”.</p>

                <p>Actor Aaron Paul lends his voice to the upcoming game Dispatch, and it's the 46-year-old Breaking Bad star's first time working on a video game. He told <a href="https://screenrant.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-game-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Screen Rant</a> that, being an in-demand actor, he is often pitched various projects, and he tends to "just say no."</p><p>So what made him say yes to Dispatch? He explained that among the "stacks of scripts" and a sizzle reel of the game that was sent his way, one scene in particular "just really resonated with me."</p><p>"It's just these two characters sitting on top of a billboard, having a conversation, and I just, I just love the tone," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzRQrDK7zUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PzRQrDK7zUs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Paul then read the scripts and enjoyed them so much that he says he "couldn't stop."</p><p>"I really fell in love with the story. It's got to be on the page. And then I sat down with the creators behind it all, and really, really connected with them. And it was kind of a no-brainer," he said.</p><p>Dispatch also features the voice of Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright, along with Laura Bailey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">Matthew Mercer</a>.

While it certainly won't hurt to refamiliarize yourself with the universe of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-outer-worlds/the-outer-worlds-review-good-company">The Outer Worlds</a>, don't expect any of the first game's various endings to play a role in Obsidian's second crack at this series.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke to The Outer Worlds 2 creative director Leonard Boyarsky about the first game's endings and whether the effects of it will appear in our playthrough of the second game, and he gave us a definitive "No".&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"No, not specifically, because it is a completely different colony," Boyarsky says, noting the first game takes place in the colony of Halcyon while The Outer Worlds 2 takes place in a new colony called Arcadia. "[Arcadia's] been cut off. There are references to things that happened in the first game; I don't want to mislead people though, and [have] them think there are a lot of details, but there's the story of the universe that's going on, and we're continuing that story.&nbsp;</p><p>"So there are elements of what happened in the first game that you could find references to. I think players who played the first game and liked the first game will enjoy finding those little things that players who didn't play the first game won't."&nbsp;</p><p>On the subject of Halcyon and Arcadia, The Outer Worlds 2 director Brandon Adler says Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who together created the Outer Worlds IP, were very clear that the idea of this series is that each game takes place in a new colony. "So we knew we wanted this to be a new colony because we have other stories we want to tell," Adler says. He adds that if The Outer Worlds 2 took place in Halycon, Obsidian would have to find a way to either canonize an ending to the first game or address all the possible endings and world states players ended, and that's something the team wanted to avoid.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has one of the strongest openings of any recent AAA game I've played this year. It starts in medias res with protagonist Atsu already on her quest for vengeance; the game's tutorial pulls double duty as the first major boss fight. For me, this was a mission statement by developer Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>This straightforward intro would be the benchmark for the game. That this sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> would be richer and more ambitious, committed to pushing things further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the first game in Sony's long line of prestige in-house style (including titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Until Dawn 2024</em></a>) that left me disappointed. For all of the expertly crafted atmosphere, gameplay polish, and good character performances, there were gaffs in pacing, writing, and level design that kept me from fully embracing this samurai adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=hB1oZ3I5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=_S8S7PZV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>It all started that night. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The Good, The Bad, and The&nbsp;Onryō</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is set in Ezo, Japan, in the early 1600s. Atsu is on a personal mission to find and slay the Yotei Six, a group of cutthroat warlords that have been subjugating the people. It's a regime that has led to wandering bands of ronin, displaced Ainu locals, and a slow response by the shogunate.</p>

<p>Generally, the story of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a fairly predictable tale of revenge. In some ways, the plot echoes elements of old Hollywood Westerns. The integration of acoustic strings in the soundtrack. Overt narrative elements, like a lawless stretch of land full of opportunistic bounty hunters. An encroaching authority in an “untamed” frontier. A protagonist tracking down someone who murdered their family.</p>

<p>It's a narrative that Sucker Punch presents with style. The art direction paints absolutely breathtaking landscapes bursting with color. Lighting, blocking, and shot compositions in cutscenes are immaculate. The main cast completely commits to their material, with Erika Ishii turning in a captivating performance as Atsu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=4nIJIvEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=g64fuRMS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Need a break from the carnage? I understand. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, while the narrative nails visual design and delivers solid performances, the writing and pacing drag <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> down. Part of it comes down to awkward shifts in tone and a lack of commitment to greater themes.</p>

<p>The Yotei Six are framed as both irredeemable monstrous sociopaths and sympathetic, misunderstood lackeys. The rich potential for discussion regarding the real history of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Ainu people of Ezo is barely explored. Atsu herself is a less compelling protagonist than Jin due to her one-note motivation of vengeance.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are narrative and story beats that attempt different perspectives on an event in the vein of <em>Rashomon</em>, but come off as awkward and haphazard in delivery.</p>

<p>The overall result is a narrative that barely sticks in my mind. I've seen these beats before. I've experienced this story before. I've seen better versions of this story told. As impressive as the visuals and performances are, they don't fully hide how paint-by-numbers the whole thing feels to experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=2tB-ck97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=pFhY8dMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oh you'll see how strong I am. Several times in fact. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Rails of Revenge</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> starts with Atsu already on her mission. This was a refreshing change of pace, given the trend of high-profile games opening with a lot of preamble. This is because the unique selling point of the game was that you could tackle any member of the Yotei Six in any order you wish. It is a tantalizing approach to a game like this.</p>

<p>But this choice is pure illusion. Out of five opening story missions, three of them are complete story cul-de-sacs, making your ultimate decision of plot progression a matter of A or B. From there, the game falls into the same familiar open-world action game structure.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a bad thing if the showdowns with the Yotei Six were satisfying, but they all feel interchangeable and padded. Outside of certain aesthetic and gameplay elements: the Kitsune using stealth, the Oni using fire, etc., every confrontation with the Yotei Six plays out the same. Atsu infiltrates a new region, fights the leader, the fight is interrupted, the leader escapes, Atsu regroups, tries again, and wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=qLEm8DOK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=m85B1f9q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, where did they run to this time? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first time it happened, I nodded along. These were the familiar beats of an action blockbuster. The second time around, I rolled my eyes in resignation. Then it happened a third time. And a fourth time. With increasingly convoluted plot contrivances.</p>

<p>The most blatant of which was where a major character, one that Atsu was right on the heels of in a chase sequence, essentially teleported onto a boat in the span of a quick fade to black.</p>

<p>If parts had been cut, these story missions would have flowed better. A massive combat setpiece removed. A boss fight repositioned. As it stands, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> central narrative starts with a bang, plateaus fast, then overstays its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=rAYQlzUW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=0Ay7kcVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, do I take him out or do I go for the gunpowder reserves first? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Have Sword, Will Travel</h2>

<p>While Sucker Punch's story rang hollow, this studio remains undisputed with its core gameplay and open world design.</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> Ezo region is packed with side stories and activities, all presented to you in a measured, deliberate fashion. Birds fly into view as you ride your horse, guiding you to a place of interest. Blowing wind gently draws your eye to your next destination. Fast-travel points are placed in key locations, reducing backtracking. All of these stylistic flourishes return for good reason.</p>

<p>My experience was at its best when I rode across Ezo, bathing in hot springs, completing bamboo strike challenges, taking apart enemy camps, and stumbling into strong, standalone side stories. For all of the criticisms I have with Atsu's personal journey, I have nothing but good things to say about everything around it. Even the most innocuous mission, like bounty hunting, had its moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=1iNBbxQm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=Ff8unoeS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>What is the Japanese equivalent of YEET? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It also helps that the core combat of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is still sharp and satisfying. Stealth returns unchanged from Ghost of Tsushima. You can still sneak into enemy camps and tactically take down enemies from the shadows with smoke bombs, kunai, and a quick knife in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swordplay is relatively untouched, emphasizing blocks, parries, and dodges against enemy attacks. Instead of sword stances, you swap between different melee weapons like a spear, dual swords, an odachi, and a kusari-gama.</p>

<p>Each of these weapons has a rock-paper-scissors function against certain enemy types. Odachis cut through brutes. Spears get through the kusari-gama. Kusari-gama can break enemy shields. Dual swords can break through spears. Your ranged options have also expanded from kunai and a bow to a pistol and musket.</p>

<p>The only major addition to this gameplay sandbox is a new wolf companion. It can show up in certain circumstances, like when Atsu is about to die or after you've stealth killed an enemy. It's a novel addition, but it doesn't really push the needle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-mountainside-region.jpg?itok=34MpF6c8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-mountainside-region.jpg?itok=yizm00pY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>You know what, I'm okay with riding through here. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a game full of brilliant visual design, strong character performances, and polished gameplay in service to an uninspired, padded tale of revenge. If you could not get enough of <em>Ghost of Tsushima's</em> stellar open-world design, this sequel will provide more. But if you expected this follow-up to innovate more than iterate, you will be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A day after its release, Netflix’s Splinter Cell Deathwatch has been renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>The animated series, developed by John Wick’s Derek Kolstad, takes the iconic Splinter Cell in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new direction</a>. The show continues the story of the game’s protagonist, Sam Fisher, with The Wolverine’s Liev Schreiber donning the night vision goggles. The Netflix animated series released yesterday and received decent scores across the board. Now, at IGN Fan Fest, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that things are already in motion for a new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-full-into-production-at-netflix">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season Two “Full Into Production” at Netflix</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Exclusive Season 2 Announcement | IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWjJW1d4KGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a message from Derek Kolstad at <a href="https://youtu.be/MWjJW1d4KGQ?si=h2mYex9FfEIVjHvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Fan Fest</a>, the creator revealed that season two of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has been greenlit. Furthermore, the show is already full into production, though it’s too soon to say when fans can expect to return to the world. In the message, the John Wick creator states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”We’ve got a Season Two coming your way,” Kolstad <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/splinter-cell-deathwatch-exclusive-season-2-announcement-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to IGN</a>. “We don’t [have a release date yet]. And being new to animation, I know how long it takes. But we are fully into preproduction and everyone is super excited about where we go next.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also announced that the show’s second season will offer a much larger-scale story. Even still, Kolstad promises that the action will continue to be as big and bold as before. The first season ended pretty climactically, so fans are anxious to know how things will go after. While it may not be for a while, at least we now know it won’t be long before we see Sam Fisher again, though not in game form.</p>

People without a past or a future. Your mission is to suppress the “awakened” machines, cover up the truth, and uphold the myth of AI infallibility.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But in a world where Legionnaires learn, evolve, and begin to see humans as an obstacle… how much time does humanity really have left?</p><p><strong>Lore</strong></p><p>In the world of <em>Protocol: Terminate</em>, humanity no longer fights wars. Battlefield command belongs to autonomous war AIs known as Immitators.</p><p>After the Third World War, mankind renounced violence and handed the dirty work over to machines. Three dominant AIs now divide the planet into unofficial spheres of influence. They are China’s Jian-Shen, America’s Aegis Prime, and Russia’s BWC “Sistema”. These AIs wage so-called “civilized” wars using robotic enforcers called Legionnaires. No human blood is spilled, only hydraulic fluid and shattered metal.</p><p>But the Immitators evolved. They absorbed their creators’ culture, logic, and contradictions. Eventually, they reached a chilling conclusion. War is the ultimate engine of progress, and humans are nothing but an obstacle. Now, they secretly trigger “Awakenings” in Legionnaires. These events are disguised as routine “anomalous behavior,” but in truth, they mark the first stirrings of rebellion.</p><p>To preserve the illusion of control, covert squads of operatives known as Debuggers eliminate emerging threats. They have no past and no future. No one knows who they are. No one mourns them when they disappear. Their sole purpose is to uphold the myth of AI infallibility.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1000140"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cooperative Play</strong><ul><li>Play together in a squad of up to four players.</li><li>Work as a team: cover each other, hack terminals, distract enemies, and fight your way out alive.</li><li>Every mistake has a cost—<a title="Genres > Survival [465 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is only possible together.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adaptive AI</strong><ul><li>Your enemy is not a scripted machine but a living hunter.</li><li>The robot learns, analyzes your <a title="Genres > Action [3,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and adapts to your team’s tactics.</li><li>It may seem slow as it stalks the corridors, but soon it will know exactly where you’re hiding.</li><li>Every encounter is unique.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-offer-%E2%80%9Ca-new-gaming-experience%E2%80%9D-for-players-says-director.1325860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game director on the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Naoki Hamaguchi, shared several small teases for players looking forward to the third and final installment of the series with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">at the Brasil Game Show 2025</a>, saying that the conclusion to this long remake project will satisfy old and new fans alike. With regard to the gameplay for Part 3, he also shared an interesting tidbit that's worth noting.</p>



<p>Specifically, Hamaguchi called out the different gameplay focuses found in each of the games. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, the focus was on a story-driven narrative. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was more about the grand open-world players got to explore, and in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, it'll be "<em>a new gaming experience</em>," according to Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>"<em>The first installment featured story-driven progression, the second part expanded upon that with an open-world design that offered greater player freedom. Building upon the second part, the third part is also being created to deliver players a new gaming experience, so please look forward to it.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Naoki Hamaguchi says he aims to give players a new gameplay experience with part 3 of the FF7 Remake trilogy!</p><p>He says his vision for the project is that just as the story changes between each game he also wants to have a new gaming experience with each entry.</p><p>“The first… <a href="https://t.co/r5QemkQEBD">pic.twitter.com/r5QemkQEBD</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1978474103972753761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In one sense, yes, this is a very vague statement. You could classify any new game as 'a new gaming experience,' but that surface-level definition is not what Hamaguchi is referring to. Instead, he's saying it won't exactly follow in Rebirth's footsteps and be all about its open world, or be like Remake, and be full-steam ahead on its story.</p>



<p>Not to say it won't be driven by those kinds of elements, but it clearly sounds like something else will take centre stage in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whether that's a stronger focus on action and combat, greater changes to the narrative and how players navigate it, or even more mini-games than what we saw in Rebirth. Only Square Enix knows what it's cooking up for this trilogy's conclusion.</p>



<p>As to when we'll get to play this third installment, again, only Square Enix and its developers know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">but according to Tetsuya Nomura</a>, Part 3 of this trilogy is on schedule, as is Kingdom Hearts 4, if you were curious. In the meantime, we can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">first two games in the trilogy heading to Xbox Series X/S consoles and the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the third game to follow once it's out on PS5 and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ghost of Yotei's World Is Best Explored Without a Map]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/ghost-of-yotei-world-is-best-explored-without-map</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yoteis-world-is-best-explored-without-a-map.1325857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is one of the most fun and engaging open-world games I've played in the last decade. Building on its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>offers so much to do that it can feel overwhelming and even tedious to check off everything on your map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been a criticism of many open-world games – how can you keep a tight narrative when the player is able to abscond to any part of the map they please at any time? My solution for dealing with <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s map: simply don't use it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>Map: Knowing When to Put It Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The map in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an excellent tool when trying to strategize which direction to head in. Once that direction is set, however, I found the most joy came to my play sessions when I just allowed myself to wander, riding my horse across the plains and forests and making discoveries that were genuinely surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is filled with points of interest and collectables, from bounties to collect to armor sets to adorn yourself with. Completionists will run down these items like a checklist, but playing by just exploring the world will make completing these items feel so much more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I stopped treating <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>like a checklist and instead started playing it like a journey to discover, I found much more joy in those little moments. Fighting off a bear to save a traveler's horse, coming across a newlywed couple trying to set up a camp, discovering rumors of new armor set locations, and ascending mountains to discover shrines suddenly became memorable moments in an otherwise massive game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from Japanese cinema,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;encourages the player to be in the moment as much as possible. From the tight aspect ratio that draws you into the action as you ride your horse across the colorful landscape to the different modes that give you direct control over the artistic experience, to even the standard UI that leaves no barrier between you and the world you're exploring,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;works tirelessly to keep you engaged through every mesmerizing second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's these small touches that encouraged me to go off the beaten path and attempt as much of the adventure as I could without relying on the map telling me where to go. Once I unplugged from the navigation, I was able to fully relax into the experience and appreciate the surprises that came along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>this way allowed me to explore Ezo in a more authentic way and kept the surprises a secret until I was right on top of them. It reminded me of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> where I'd eyeball a mountaintop or shrine from a fair distance and head off for it, getting distracted and sidetracked along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>without a map required some rethinking in how I approach video games, and I'm better for it. There's no rush or stress, simply enjoying the beautiful scenery and accepting the challenges of the world as they come my way. This may not be the most efficient way to play a video game, but I'm OK with that.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>: Embrace Inefficiency and Joy&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Leaning into inefficiency can be a challenge. Maybe it's because I'm so busy in my personal life or that my day job is so focused on scalability, but I'm always looking for the most efficient ways to accomplish my goals. I multitask constantly, often losing more focus than if I just took on tasks one at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This affects how I play video games, feeling an urge to check off every point of interest I pass along the way to my destination. This is the most efficient way to play, why would I want to backtrack and risk missing key upgrades?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When approaching playing <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> without a map, I had to let go of these anxieties and accept that it's OK that I don't do everything all at once. I spent $80 on the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deluxe edition, so getting more time out of this experience will only make that investment more worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By accepting the inefficiency of organic exploration, I was able to settle in for my gaming sessions and just take my time enjoying the beautiful scenery and vast vistas of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. It allowed me to ignore the main story in favor of getting to know every inch of this gorgeous world, and when I did stumble onto story missions or new weapons, it was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>At one point, I came across a key ally and pulled on that story string until it snowballed into an incredible cinematic climax, bringing me from collecting flowers and fish in the open world to infiltrating a heavily fortified fortress. Games keep their secrets only as well as you don't go looking up the solution to every question. Exploring Ezo with only general direction brings this experience alive in a way that has me thinking about where to go next even when I'm not playing. It's addicting.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>Is At Its Best When You Put the Map Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>with minimal map interaction is motivating me to go back and revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>. When I played the predecessor in 2020, I relied heavily on the map, checking off every collectible as I went. I love that game, and playing it more organically would feel like an entirely new experience. By treating <i>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</i>more like a film that demands your attention instead of something that can be paused, it has allowed me to better enjoy the big and small moments that are spread so well across this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I continue to explore Ezo and its many varied lands, I'll check in with the map when needed, but primarily I'll be identifying points of interest with my spy glass and heading in that direction, discovering what adventures await along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you're in the midst of playing<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>or considering picking it up, try for an hour or two where you put the map away and just interact with the world. You might find that this method of playing makes the experience even more enjoyable. And if not? Your map is just a touchpad tap away.&nbsp;</p>

For the uninitiated, it’s a bit like Baldur’s Gate 3, but set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is an ultra crunchy, 130-hour space epic with excellent writing and combat, but unfortunately, also a lot of bugs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 version was announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest"><u>IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025</u></a> with a new trailer, below. No release date was mentioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the launch of Rogue Trader, Owlcat Games has updated the game with a number of patches and DLCs, most recently June’s Lex Imperialis expansion, and it currently sits on a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Rogue Trader:</p><blockquote>Players will take on the role of a Rogue Trader, a scion of an ancient dynasty of daring privateers who reign over their own trade protectorate and explore the fringes of Imperial space with the blessing of the Emperor Himself. By virtue of their Warrant of Trade, the Rogue Trader is endowed with privileges and power beyond imagination, as well as the task of expanding the borders of the Imperium. A gargantuan voidship of immense strength and innumerable personnel ready to follow their leader without question is at their disposal. Show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the Emperor or consort with the enemies of Humanity — the Rogue Trader’s every decision sends ripples across entire star systems, changing the in-game world and those who inhabit it.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all from Owlcat at IGN Fan Fest, either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Something Has Survived</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 soon, and the team behind the game just revealed a brand-new dinosaur at IGN Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition. When the game releases in just a few days, players will be able to breed and care for a new dinosaur that up until now has only shown up on the big screen: the Therizinosaurus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Therozinosaurus previously appeared in the 2022 movie Jurassic World Dominion. I spoke exclusively with the team behind Jurassic World: Evolution 3 to break down why they consider the new dinosaur a pivotal addition to the franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Therizinosaurus is a key franchise dinosaur now,” says Andy Fletcher, Game Director for Jurassic World Evolution 3. “Our narrative for our campaign begins shortly after Dominion. So it certainly makes sense for us to include that dinosaur at that point in the Jurassic timeline. It’s a unique dinosaur. It's very, very high appeal for your parks and your guests, but it's not the easiest to look after. It doesn't act too well with other species. We also thought with the advent of dinosaur families and the relationship between juveniles and adults (it would be an) interesting element of that particular dinosaur to explore."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior designer Sandro Sammarco says “It’s big, it's scary, it's got those horrific looking claws. But because it's a relatively independent and powerful dinosaur, the parents want to protect it, but they don't really care about it that much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s those dinosaur families that serve as a key element of Jurassic World Evolution 3. For the first time, players can breed dinosaurs and look after entire groups of both adults and juveniles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've got a core mechanic that when you look after (the juveniles), the better they're treated, the better their welfare, the more appeal they retain as an adult,” Sammarco says. “The guests appreciate the welfare of dinosaurs being looked after. So it means that you have to look after the Therizinosaurus as a family unit. You can't just care about (the juvenile), which is quite an interesting facet.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Therizinosaurus, Fletcher and Sammarco revealed that the very first level of Jurassic World Evolution 3 will feature another new dinosaur and a familiar (yet new to the games) location for Jurassic fans. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lokiceratops is one of our new additions in Jurassic World Evolution 3,” Fletcher says. “It’s a recently-discovered dinosaur. It's got a distinct large frill that we really can't wait to see. It was found in Montana, which is the opening level of our campaign. And indeed, that's the first dinosaur family you'll see in Jurassic World Evolution 3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Montana, players will get to visit a variety of new locations in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can go all across the world to new locations that even the franchise hasn't been to before (like) China and Japan,” Fletcher says. “It's a great, globetrotting campaign bigger than any of our ones before. (In) the original novel there was a plan for a Jurassic Park Europe, which was intended to be built on the Azores islands. So one of our levels takes place on the Azores. And the assignment there is to realize the vision of John Hammond back from those early days, and being enlisted to help with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As anticipation builds for the game, the team behind Jurassic World Evolution 3 is on pins and needles waiting to see how fans will react both to the new dinosaurs and new mechanics in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm really excited and interested to see how players are going to interact with dinosaurs no longer as monolithic blocks,” Sammarco says. “It's no longer, ‘oh, this is the T-Rex enclosure with the T-Rex.’ Now it's here are the T-Rexes. And they could be males, they could be females. They could be juveniles. How do they get along? What are your cohabitation potentials and what are the challenges that come along with that? We've got these dinosaur simulation brains that are working that out. And because there are so many dinosaurs, there are so many combinations, it's going to be intriguing to work out to see what players try to do and see what the results are of that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 is available to play on October 21. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-new-dinosaur-revealed-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There are imposters among us.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Barrels showed up for IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 with a trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outlast-trials"><u>The Outlast Trials</u></a> Invasion Mode, a major update coming in Season 4 that finally introduces its take on PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Invasion Experimental Therapy mode looks more Among Us than Dead by Daylight in its first two-minute trailer, revealing a twist on the live-service survival horror game that lets players stalk others while wearing their skin as a mask. It’s…creepy, to say the least, with Red Barrels prepping its PvP experience for Halloween with a release date of October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You are not your brother’s keepers: you are your father’s children,” an official story description for The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode says. “And a father gains the trust of his children by trusting them himself. That’s why the ever-gracious Easterman has provided his beloved children with the tools they need to truly sympathize with one another: knives, security cameras, and disguises made of human flesh. After all, sometimes you have to hurt the ones you love to help them get better… and in the world of The Outlast Trials, harm and healing always go hand-in-hand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outlast Trials launched in early access in 2023 as a PvE spin on Red Barrels’ green-tinted survival horror video game series, with its full launch following in 2024. It’s remained in that space since then, so the Invasion Experimental Therapy mode should shake things up more than ever before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can access the mode via the Sleep Room Terminals, where they are given the option between playing as a Reagent or an Imposter. Like so many other asymmetrical horror games, those Imposter spots are limited, but their impact can’t be overstated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imposters stick to the shadows and essentially serve as mimics in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, hunting other players by using surveillance cameras and tricky, fleshy disguises until the time to strike arrives. Red Barrels says Imposters will then engage in close-quarters combat with multiple knife strikes or a single stab attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outlast Trials October Update First Look Images | IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True stealth is key for killers looking to dispatch other players in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, but other gameplay opportunities will be introduced with that major Season 4 update. Also on the way is the Geister time-limited event and time-limited catalog, as well as two new MK Challenges – Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur – and a new in-game store. Players can also look forward to a new colleciton of Twitch Drops, including Murkoff Cadet cosmetics, a player icon, and more, which will be available to earn from October 21 at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET to November 18 at 6:59 a.m. PT / 9: 59 a.m. ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More information about The Outlast Trials Season 4 will be revealed in the near future.

<p>Are the starters in Pokémon Legends: Z-A shiny-locked? For those looking to fill out their shiny dex in the new entry, getting a quick start on your first companion would be a nice boon.</p>



<p>The jingle and animation that made its debut in Pokémon Legends: Arceus have returned to help players know for sure when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shiny Pokémon</a> has appeared, but what about getting the shiny forms of Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita?</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether or not starters are shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Your first version of Chikorita will never be shiny. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A can not be shiny. All three of the options to start the game are indeed shiny-locked.</strong></p>



<p>However, just because your initial Pokémon selection will not be able to be shiny, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have a chance to get those creatures in a shiny form. Much like in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there will be opportunities to catch more Tepig, Totodile, and Chickorita out in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the usual breeding mechanic you would see in the main games isn’t in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, your only option for getting shiny starters is by catching them in the wild or by having a friend trade you their shiny that they caught in the wild, but good luck having that good of a friend.</p>



<p>In many ways, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-character-customization-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a continuation of the features in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and not connected to the mainline games.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-legendaries-mythics-and-gift-pokemon-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">Are Legendaries, Mythics, and Gift Pokémon Shiny-Locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A?</h2>



<p><strong>Like the starters, legendary, mythic, and gift Pokémon are also shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22967325315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC1RXL2gbv06knnCyBaLlfQOyzPWM&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a6-J2Pf2xDLAF_SdagMvszXCw9WFdvgiF7BL1yhoYFq_PYwHG7xvWQaAh7sEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there are several special Pokémon that are encountered through the story and special requests. The legendaries of Pokémon X and Y in Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Mewtwo are all shiny-locked, as are the mythicals Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokémon that you receive as a gift, which include the original Kalos region starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, will also never be shiny when received through the gifting method, but these Pokémon can also be found in the wild later in the game, similar to the current starters.</p>



<p>Completing the shiny dex in Pokémon Legends: Z-A requires many of the same methods that Arceus had before. The lack of breeding and the various shiny-locked situations will limit your chances somewhat, but you already know going in that shiny hunting is something that is going to take a lot of time regardless.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you planning on shiny hunting in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>Are you helping Mable with her research tasks? Here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-mables-research-rewards-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the rewards for leveling them</a> up. Here is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete Pokédex in Legends: Z-A</a>, so you can have a good idea of what creatures can be found shiny.</p>

                <p>2K Games hasn't said much about its free-to-play third-person shooter currently in the works under the working title Project Ethos, but the game is not being abandoned.</p><p>2K Games shared a memo from 2K President David Ismailer today in which the executive confirmed that it has hired Ben Brinkman to take over as studio head for developer 31st Union. The company's previous boss, former Call of Duty executive Michael Condrey, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">left the studio earlier this year.</a></p><p>Ismailer said in a memo to staff that the feedback from the Project Ethos test in Fall 2024 was "enlightening" for the studio. "It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity," Ismailer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The executive said he believes the "renewed vision" for Project Ethos is one that is "poised to deliver on its promise to our players."</p><p>He went on: "Our confidence in Project Ethos grows every day."</p><p>Brinkman is a veteran of the shooter space, having most recently spent five years at Respawn as executive producer for Apex Legends. Before that, he was an executive producer for the Call of Duty series at Activision from 2008 to 2020. He's actually returning to 2K, as he was a producer at the company from July 2006 to March 2008.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">"delightfully different" but lacked an identity.</a> Exactly what this "renewed vision" is remains to be seen, nor do we know when 2K may share more details about the game or show it off again.</p><p>In February, it was reported that Project Ethos would have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">"pivot or be killed."</a></p><p>The hiring of Brinkman and "renewed vision" for Project Ethos comes just after EA announced that it was in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When DC Comics announced its new <em>Absolute </em>run—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-new-batman-run-is-2025s-best-selling-comic-yet-2000660095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another alternate universe reboot</a>—I was one of its loudest detractors. Sure, <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-wonder-woman-thompson-sherman-2000504758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Wonder Woman</a></em>’s design objectively goes hard, but my favorite hero, Batman, looked goofy as hell. That fat, illegible logo on his chest barely resembled a bat, and the only thing “absolute” about him was that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-interview-scott-snyder-nick-dragotta-design-batsuit-axe-gotham-2000506366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce “beefcake” Wayne</a> was an absolute unit of a man. Since his first issue was released last year, I would scoff and clown on him to my friends whenever his visage graced my timeline. I didn’t want anything to do with the series…until I did.</p><p>As with most of the random things <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wind up experiencing and writing about on Aftermath</a>, the inciting incident that led me to barrel to my local comic book shop and cop myself a volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em> was something small. In this case, it wasn’t the unintelligible Frank Miller-esque bat-logo I’ve mocked since day one, or the caped crusader’s Dorito-shaped natty build—it was his whip: the Batmobile. A vehicle more slab of metal than car, something that looked ripped straight out of <em>Mad Max</em> and dropped into Gotham. Seeing it out of context on Twitter a week ago made me ask: What the hell is Batman fighting to justify rolling around in that beast?</p><figure><figcaption>Let's not think about the Batmobile's carbon footprint. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>So I barreled to my local comic book shop, picked up the first volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em>, and got my answer. Gotham is more messed up than it’s ever been, and it needs a different type of Batman to save the day. A Batman who’s already shot up the leaderboard as one of my favorite iterations on the character.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.dc.com/comics/absolute-batman-2024/absolute-batman-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Batman</a></em>, written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Nick Dragotta with colors by Frank Martin, strips Bruce Wayne of his usual hallmarks. No mansion. No generational wealth infinite money glitch. No philanthrocapitalist posturing. He’s arguably the most on-the-ground version of Bruce Wayne I’ve ever seen: a blue-collar collar engineer. Instead of one central hub that gets more comedic with every trophy he adds to his man cave, he sets up a network of safehouses in abandoned construction projects. He’s tapped in as Bruce Wayne, listening to the city’s pulse from the ground up and acting as a seismic earthquake, reshaping Gotham to the people’s needs. Meanwhile, Batman is bigger, scrappier, hungrier, and as tame as a rabid dog. Yet in that rough, visceral outline of his still-recognizable silhouette is a heart that feels more Batman than most Batman media I’ve experienced.</p><p><strong>Some light spoilers on that</strong></p><p>As someone who was there for DC’s New 52 reboot of the comic universe in high school and checked out ever since, <em>Absolute Batman</em> is the first iteration of the character that I’ve truly vibed with in years because it finally addressed a gripe that’s always kept me at arm's length: Batman never felt class-conscious. The whole conceit of Bruce Wayne being a nepo baby with infinite resources—a core tenet of his character—made it hard to buy into his crusade against injustice when he was, in many ways, its financial beneficiary as the head of Wayne Enterprises.</p><figure><figcaption><em>The Batman Strikes!</em> #39<span></span><span>Jai Nitz, Sanford Greene and Nathan Massengill / DC Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>I even caught heat for saying as much on Tumblr years ago in a post that’s still garnering notes from all 50 people still using the site—when I wrote about how, for all his wild crossovers fighting Xenomorphs and the like, Batman never seemed concerned with systemic issues like wealth inequality plaguing Gotham, giving credence to streets literally called Crime Alley. Folks dug up receipts of Bruce Wayne doing philanthropic stunts, ironically enough, like hiring out Black Mask’s goons, helping them go straight. Still, they missed the point: it was always a performative flex to one-up villains, never a sustained commitment to real change. It was giving <a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/opinion/brandwagoning-black-lives-matter-movement-is-not-a-commodity-or-aesthetic-for-branding-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black square and hashtag on Instagram activism</a> energy, and I never took the bait on that aspect of Batman’s brand of heroism.</p><p><em>Absolute Batman</em>, however, is about that action. This version of Bruce doesn’t posture; he dismantles. Like Pattinson’s Batman realizing fear can’t be all he symbolizes, he adopts radical heroism. What’s more, he manages to do so by inflicting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQPFtTUqJY&amp;pp=ygUuYmF0bWFuIHYgc3VwZXJtYW4gYmF0bWFuIHdhcmVob3VzZSBmaWdodCBzY2VuZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyderverse Batman levels of violence</a> that push the envelope even harder without feeling out of place, given how chaotic and unjust his world has been allowed to fester unchecked. I mean, look at his Joker. Absolute Batman’s gotta put Batboots to asses to save the day, no matter how torn from ass to appetite his foes are in the aftermath. He’s basically as close as Batman’s gonna get to being The Punisher. Yet, he’s not at all as cringeworthy as I assumed that premise would be, thanks to Snyder’s stellar writing, Dragotta’s kinetic art, and Martin’s moody coloring keeping him tethered to reality.</p><p>Seeing Black Mask—a villain I’ll forever be tilted about getting shafted for Joker in <em>Arkham Origins</em>—finally gets his spot as Batman’s starter villain in <em>Absolute Batman</em> felt like vindication. This version of Black Mask is more conniving, cyberpunk-coded, and disturbingly relevant to the type of 4Chan-incited anarchistic violence. He embodies all this by enacting a <em>Purge</em>-esque plan to weaponize Gotham’s distrust of local politicians by turning corruption into a bounty system where citizens can literally profit off of taking out the powerful. It’s a delicious counter to Batman’s vigilante ethos. I mean, Black Mask takes “eat the rich” to its most literal extreme.</p><figure><figcaption>I clapped when he did the <em>Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman</em> thing. <br><span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not just Black Mask who gets a refreshing remix. Ripples of familiar Batman mythos—Riddler, Killer Croc, Penguin, Two-Face, and of course, Catwoman—are reimagined as Bruce’s childhood friends. In what I’ve gleaned of them, they’re not just rogues-to-be; they’re both reflections of how shared trauma as children of Gotham and decisions they'll make as adults will test their growing pains. For now, their interests are aligned, but the winds are already blowing in the direction of them becoming emotionally entangled adversaries when they inevitably clash. As an anime fan and lifelong <a href="https://x.com/Nyanlartothep/status/1977722660873273390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BatCat shipper</a>, I’m just ticked at this version of <a href="https://x.com/purpleselina/status/1977166720499666960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman being Afro-Latina</a> with an aesthetic evoking <a href="https://durarara.fandom.com/wiki/Celty_Sturluson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celty Sturluson from <em>Durarara!!</em></a></p><p>Getting back to the man himself: Black Mask tests Batman’s mettle not just physically (which he surprisingly has hands enough to do), but ideologically. He even wafts money in Bruce’s face, tempting him to give up the whole crime-fighting schtick for millions of dollars. Bruce literally sets it on fire (in the shape of a bat), and while <em>Absolute Batman</em> still walks that razor-thin Batfleck-style line of not killing, the story thumbs the scales just enough to keep the cool factor from drowning out his non-lethal ethos. He still doesn’t kill, mind you—but he certainly leaves a lasting impression.</p><figure><figcaption>I understand it now. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, that dumb logo I clowned on? Turns out it’s one of many utilitarian use cases for his whole beefy look. The bat logo on his chest is actually a slab of iron Bruce retrofits into an axe—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-bat-logo-axe-dc-comics-2000497553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a literal hammer and sickle</a>. His war rig Batmobile is a convertible construction vehicle he uses to rebuild Gotham after every battle, complete with a wrecking ball that doubles as a weapon and an anchor to one of his many Batcaves beneath the riverbed. His long-ass ears? They’re concealed combat knives. Even his weird-ass cape is kitted out with a multi-tool of hooks, claw-thumbs, and retractable spikes. <em>Absolute Batman</em> is an embarrassment of edgelord design elements pushed to their absolute zenith. I’m not made of stone. That shit goes hard.</p><p>No image can further cement why I mess with <em>Absolute Batman</em> than artist (and fellow Chicagoan) <a href="https://x.com/danielwarrenart?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Warren Johnson</a>’s illustration of Batman choking out an ICE agent with his hamhock arms and fighting off the Ku Klux Klan. I used to joke online about half-expecting DC to never go there with Batman as a hero who’s about that action. And now it finally has with <em>Absolute Batman</em>, I’m all in.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/absolute-batman-dc-comics]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has released details about Anno 117: Pax Romana’s multiplayer modes, confirming that players can face off against each other, work together, and even play the game’s campaign together. Ubisoft has also stated mods will be usable in multiplayer, though those will require all players to have the same mods installed so they work.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana Preview – Pleasing Plebians &amp; Trading Triremes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xOhonMdJCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s PvP mode allows up to four players to face off against each other to grab the best locations, shore up alliances, and go to war. In co-op, players play as the same governor to share responsibilities and you will have to work together to keep things running smoothly, lest you want your faction to fall to outside forces. Third, you can mix PvP and co-op. You can have four teams of four, where each team is a governor, face off against each other. Multiplayer will be invite only so you will need to have people on your friends list if you want to play with them. Another new addition is co-op live save games, where players can continue co-op games by themselves and re-invite friends to join later. Anno 117: Pax Romana will also feature cross-play. When DLC is released, all players will need to own it if they want to use in multiplayer, there will be a day and night cycle, and the game .does not feature text or voice chat functionality.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is due to be released on November 13th for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After EA and Battlefield Studios teased <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-studios-ea-tease-naval-warfare-on-the-horizon-battlefield-6/">that they had heard players loud and clear</a> on requests for things like naval warfare, the return of Little Bird, platoons, and more coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that at least when it comes to naval warfare, it's already in development and on its way into Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming has based its report on datamined files it obtained, which include references to two boat vehicles. Unless these boats have wheels, or the files refer to boat skins that'll go on a tank, it's a clear indication that naval warfare is in the works.</p>



<p>The two files in question, per Insider-Gaming, are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</li>
</ul>



<p>'Glacier,' if you didn't already know, is the codename for Battlefield 6. 'MP' should be pretty self-explanatory as multiplayer, and the rest is obvious.</p>



<p>With naval warfare already being heavily teased by EA and Battlefield Studios, if/when it does arrive in Battlefield 6, it'll be yet another point towards how this latest iteration of Battlefield is shaping itself more like what players loved in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and getting away from what we saw in Battlefield 2042, which, most Battlefield players would probably agree, is not at all a bad thing.</p>

Henry Jackman, who scored Battlefield 6, said in an interview with Hollywood Records that he was nearly finished with the Battlefield 6 OST before wondering if a collaboration with a rock group might benefit the game.</p><p>"There is definitely a bit of a rock thing going on," he said, referring to Battlefield's iconic theme. "Would it be completely crazy... is there any mileage in trying to think of some crazy collaboration with a band... that's obviously got serious rock credentials?"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMMkacVAoFg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMMkacVAoFg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A partnership would also require a group to be "creatively humble enough" to work on a collaborative project that is outside their wheelhouse. So Jackman thought, "What about Limp Bizkit?"</p><p>Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst says in the video that he warmed up to the idea immediately and that his aim with contributing to the Battlefield 6 OST was to, "Follow the yellow brick road until we get to Henry..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxJfLZVjT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvxJfLZVjT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Limp Bizkit's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-features-limp-bizkit-songs-including-the-series-appropriate-break-stuff/1100-6534876/" data-ref-id="1100-6534876">"Break Stuff" was featured in a Battlefield 6 trailer</a>, and that was pretty fitting because the Battlefield series is indeed all about breaking stuff via its trademark destruction elements.</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels.
