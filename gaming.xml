						<h5>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h5><p><span>January 17th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><span>As the one known as Zliuan, players take up arms as a young warrior whose village lineage has typically been to operate from the shadows and provide hidden support to help dictate the flow of battle. Long before <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/">Dynasty Warrior Origins</a> begins, the story has been established that the village from which Ziluan hails has been known for producing a force of change known as the Guardians of Peace. These not-assassins operate from the shadows and do what must be done to keep tyrants from getting out of line and generally guiding the populace towards a particular goal. While this endgame is not immediately known to the player, the way that the Guardians of Peace are woven together with the formation of the three kingdoms that would eventually lead into the tale of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms makes even the most familiar of story beats into something fresh and exciting.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The story of Dynasty Warriors Origins opens with Ziluan as a sort of mercenary for hire with no allegiance to any of the major kingdoms, only in quiet service to the Emperor himself. Along the way, he allies himself with Guan Yu first before becoming introduced to the other key players across Cao Cao, Sun Jian, and Liu Bei’s distinct factions. As is typical for nearly every other Dynasty Warriors title, it’s the defeat of Zhang Jiao and the Yellow Turban Rebellion that truly kicks off the story and establishes the major players as proper musou warriors. The first three (of five total) chapters follow the story from the Yellow Turban Rebellion up through Cao Cao’s rescue of Emperor Xian. It isn’t until the fourth and fifth chapters that players can ally themselves with one of the three factions. Upon completing the main story for the first time, players can enjoy a new difficulty, an additional weapon type, weapon crafting/upgrading systems, and the ability to jump back into the timeline and ally with another faction or perhaps complete some secret missions objectives to divert the story into a ‘What if..?’ scenario and earn progress towards a true ending.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Not even Dynasty Warriors Origins has been able to escape the formulaic approach that the Musou series is known for. As but a simple one-man-wrecking-ball, players will take field against hundreds, if not thousands, of enemy troops per battlefield, many often dispatched in only a couple of attacks. It’s the sort of power fantasy that players have come to expect from Omega Force. Enemy officers and generals are the ones that offer up a true challenge unless playing on the highest of difficulty levels and even then, a careful approach to the dodge and parrying mechanics introduced into Dynasty Warriors Origins can turn the tide of battle against even the most acclaimed of generals.</span></p>
<p><span>MIssion objectives range from taking over one or more bases or defeating key enemy officers for most missions, both story and sidequests. Main story missions offer a fair bit of complexity to mix things up from the main dozen or so missions per playthrough. Usually these follow more of the canon established by the Romance of the Three Kingdoms mythos, beginning with The Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating around the Battle of Chibi where Zhuge Liang’s fire tactics made history in more ways than one. It’s this decisive battle that forms the eventual Three Kingdoms era, so many of the battles and familiar faces that players may recognize from later battles don’t make an appearance. Sorry, but that includes leaving out Meng Huo and his elephants.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Morale and Fortitude are two core mechanics to this latest entry of Dynasty Warriors Origins. Jumping into a fresh battlefield will usually put the player faction at a disadvantage which can be rectified by actions such as defeating an enemy officer or capturing a base. Morale in particular ties directly into how difficult an enemy officer can be to best in combat. When Morale is high for the opposing force, it adds on additional bars of Fortitude to the enemy’s strength. Typically the easiest method to defeat an enemy officer is to deplete their fortitude with repeated attacks or perfectly timed parries/dodges and initiate an Assault attack by pressing the Triangle button once fully depleted to do a massive combo attack that can oftentimes defeat lesser enemy officers in a single use. On the flip side, this draws out fights against enemy officers by lessening the amount of damage that they take from regular or musou special attacks and leaving the primary source of damage as these Assault moves.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To break up the monotony and repetition of the hack-and-slash mass battles that the series is known for, Dynasty Warriors Origins gives players a few unique tools that have rarely been seen in prior titles. Midway through the story, regardless of which of the three factions that Ziluan allies with, he will gain the ability to command a small squad that accompanies him as if he were a full-fledged officer. These AI units will attack on their own but can also be directly commanded via Tactics. These Tactics operate on time-based cooldowns and allow Ziluan up to three different unique abilities, such as firing a volley of flaming arrows and charging into the enemy line by horseback.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>It’s a bit strange to have featured as a major mechanic, especially as Ziluan grows in strength and can dispatch an entire squad of enemy grunt soldiers in a single attach, but Dynasty Warriors Origins bills the established cast of the Three Kingdoms as these all-powerful warlords that can level the battlefield in a single attack. Because of this, they’re treated as some sort of ultimate move and can be swapped to upon filling their respective meter. For a couple of minutes, players can rampage the battlefield as one of their allied officers as an invincible, unstoppable force and culminating in a true musou attack upon completion that can easily rack up enemy KO’s in the hundreds. Many of these officers are the very same that they’ll be fighting alongside during the campaign missions, but there is one fan favorite that’s unlocked upon completing the game for the first time that can be used when replaying any earlier mission.</span></p>
<p><span>Rather than simply jumping from one mission to the next with a minor bit of exposition in between as is the series’ tradition, Dynasty Warriors Origins presents an open world for players to run around while keeping the battles themselves confined to separate stages. Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have reverted the changes they brought to players with Dynasty Warriors 9 where battles took place on that open field. As Ziluan runs about the field by foot or by horseback, random stages will pop up across each of the many provinces of China. These lead into much smaller bite sized missions and can be nigh infinitely repeated with some maybe lasting 20-30 seconds to rout 100 enemy soldiers. Proving oneself to a province enough times to win their favor usually gives the player a handy upgrade, whether it’s a more potent consumable or a faster steed.&nbsp;</span></p>

</figure>


<p><span>Progression in Dynasty Warriors Origins is a bit of a strange mish-mash of systems intended to see Ziluan slowly grow into a true musou warrior. Rather than earning your standard experience points and leveling up in the traditional fashion, levels are directly tied into a combined weapon proficiency across all weapon types. By securing enough kills with a particular weapon type (others also gain proficiency points, albeit at a slower pace), Ziluan will gain a level that comes with a statistical HP/ATK/DEF bump and one point on his rank which unlocks new skill panels to invest precious skill points once a certain threshold is reached. Ziluan earns one skill point for every hundred enemies slain, so blitzing through one of the repeatable missions and only racking up fifty or sixty kills won’t actually yield him anything.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of these two systems operating in tandem to make the player character more powerful, sometimes it’s beneficial to constantly rotate between weapon types and do a few missions with each. In proper musou fashion, enemy officers may randomly drop weapons but can also be purchased from the shop. It isn’t until after wrapping up the 25-30 hour narrative for a single faction that the weapon shop expands their services to transfer the randomly generated skills from one weapon to another, while another option permits fusing weapons of the same type together for permanent stat upgrades on that particular weapon. Maximizing one’s weapon is crucial for the postgame and extreme difficulty options, although players can just as easily finish the main narrative relying on enemy drops or the odd weapon purchase from the town weapon shop.</span></p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins does away with some storied traditions but establishes the tried-and-true mass combat with an almost cinematic level of attention to detail. Not only is this the most fun I've had with a Dynasty Warriors title in years but the overarching story woven into the origins of the Three Kingdoms is already one of the more interesting tales of 2025 thus far. Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have shown that there's still room for innovation in the series and while the overall experience has been scaled back compared to earlier Dynasty Warriors entries, Dynasty Warriors Origins excels at every level.</p>

					<h2>Dynasty Warriors Origins</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins provides a compact narrative from the Yellow Turban Rebellion up through the Battle of Chibi and the formation of the Three Kingdoms. While the amnesiac protagonist is about as interesting as a brick, his prowess to change the tide of battle is a true force to be reckoned with.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>A tightly paced narrative that builds towards the establishment of the Three Kingdoms
</li><li>Restarting the battle from key checkpoints instead of from the beginning
</li><li>Enemy officer duels are back
</li><li>Overworld map with bite-sized missions between the grandiose 15+ minute major battles
</li><li>Game opens up with new systems after completing one story arc and working towards the true ending
</li><li>Secret unlockable weapon is just as impressive and deadly as ever
</li><li>120FPS support on PlayStation 5 Pro</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>New protagonist is bland and mostly just goes along with the flow
</li><li>Defeating an enemy officer can be a slow to break their fortitude and deal damage when enemy morale is high
</li><li>Greatly reduced number of weapon types (half of the weapons are spears while throwing knives/large maces can be used by enemy officers but not Ziluan)
</li><li>Not even a complete narrative overhaul can prevent repetition from setting in 30-50 hours into the branching story</li>						</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-published-lost-soul-aside-wont-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-it-seems.1080744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games appear to have quietly removed the requirement for PC players of upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>to have a PSN account in order to play.</p>

<p>According to the game's Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3378960/history/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update history</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/psn-account-no-longer-needed-for-lost-soul-aside-on-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twisted Voxel</a>), the PSN requirement was removed back in December, but Sony didn't announce the removal of said requirement at that point.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>isn't out yet, it's technically possible that the requirement was removed for some arcane administrative reason, and that Sony still fully intends to require PC players to sign up with a PSN account in order to play the game on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=UHtB-OHH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=ghWu7udA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>may be one of the only PlayStation-published PC games not to require a PSN account to play.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if the PSN account requirement truly has been removed, then that would indicate it won't be necessary to sign up for a PSN account in order to play&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>when it eventually comes out on PC.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, PSN accounts are required to play multiplayer Sony-published games on PC; games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>require one, if only for their multiplayer modes, while titles like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal&nbsp;</em>don't need you to have a PSN account to play on Steam.</p>

<p>This isn't always the case, though. According to its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2531310/info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>, the upcoming PC port of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will require players to sign up for PSN, even though it's a single-player game with no multiplayer component.</p>

<p>The PSN requirement for PC games is an issue for which Sony has gotten into trouble in the past. When Sony announced it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link" rel="nofollow">would begin imposing a PSN account requirement</a> on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players, the backlash was so great that the company was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">forced to walk its decision back</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=SvbBRv23 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=W1r2w-4m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will, for some reason, require a PSN account to play on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll get to see whether&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>'s PSN account removal is for real when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">launches sometime this year</a>. It's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it does.

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Sunset Visitor's narrative game tells a potent tale, one that blends multiple themes with messy three-dimensional characters. The tale of Watcher and her glimpse into the life of her sovereign The All Mother is a nuanced spotlight on the effects of traumas small and large cascading into society. It is a meditative experience about what we do with our emotional baggage and how it can lead to the most horrible acts and the most noble of sacrifices.</p>

<p>For a debut title by a new studio, it is a narrative with measured confidence. One that expresses itself with passion, one that is spellbinding to experience start to finish</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>You can create a game with a charming lead man with a fedora and a bullwhip that solves ancient puzzles, but it won't truly become<em> Indiana Jones</em> if the writing doesn't match the feel. A perfect mix of knowledgeable investigation into ancient cultures, sinister enemies monologuing, and quippy banter (but not too much of the last part.)</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> finds that mix introducing the players to a mystery and continuing to expand upon it, to new memorable characters that feel fully fleshed out in the world and giving us an Indiana Jones to embody that nails the original aesthetic to fulfil the nostalgia. All while offering new fans to the genre a faithful take to continue to explore the greater franchise (except <em>Crystal Skull</em>… you can ignore that one)</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>For everyone who cries out against politics in their video games, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> defiantly asks, "What if everything in the game was political?" It has the subtlety of a nuclear bomb, with metaphors veiled so thinly you could barely see the shrink wrap. Nonetheless, it's a poignant, meaningful story, especially amid the reality we've all (sort of) shared these past few years.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> goes beyond simply saying, "This thing is unequivocally bad." There's nuance in its messaging, providing the player a launchpad to critically think for themself. For example, racism socioeconomically harms people, so we should see everyone as equals. But if you go too far, do we lose what makes each person and their culture special?</p>

<p>Louis and Sanctism aren't quite 1-to-1 caricatures of real-life figures, but there are enough parallels that the line between fantasy and reality can blur a bit. Is strongman leadership all it's cracked up to be? Is a church state really about religion, or power?</p>

<p>That blurring of reality and fantasy seems to be Studio Zero's goal, as portrayed by the (slightly convoluted) fantasy book within the game. The protagonist and his party often refer to a book about a skyscraper-laden utopia, both idealizing and questioning it. It's a direct commentary on what the player can and should do with the game itself.</p>

<p>Much like the <em>Persona </em>games before it, it's easy to come away with the overall message painting humanity in a bad light. But in reality, it's about finding the internal will and hope to fight for a better tomorrow for yourself and the ones around you.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>, while it's no longer possible to simply use a mod manager to place&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin mods into the game's directories and expect them to work when booting up a match, a new workaround may still allow you to use your favorite mods.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a catch. Modding steadfastly remains a violation of NetEase's terms and conditions when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so you could get banned if you're discovered using them, but that's always been the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=6DgmZkYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=NJDiwzx1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to mod&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;despite the recent clampdown? You still can, but there's a big catch.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want to get too technical here, but essentially, the new workaround involves gaining direct access to a certain kind of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>file with the .pak extension.</p>

<p>As Dexerto points out, there's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another way</a> to circumvent&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' mod ban, but this one's creator has admitted it's a "temporary fix" and that unless you've got a specific hardware setup, you could damage your storage drive if you use it for character model modding.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clamped down</a> on&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>modding with the advent of Season 1 last week, introducing a new authenticity check for character skins that essentially invalidates most existing mods.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin modding scene was (and, to a certain extent, remains) quite active prior to this clampdown, with users creating mods that turned characters into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vegeta</a>,&nbsp;<em>GTA: San Andreas</em>' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/63" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CJ</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Smoke</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/80" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pochita</a>.</p>

<p>New information claims that Bungie’s upcoming MOBA, Gummy Bears, is inspired by Smash Bros and is being developed by a new PlayStation Studio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, sources close to the project have revealed that Bungie’s Gummy Bears will introduce several elements from Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. franchise while being a “MOBA at its core.” Aspects such as a “percentage-based damaged system,” players being knocked off the map, and more will seemingly be incorporated into the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, Bungie’s Gummy Bears has been in development for three years and aims to target a younger audience by incorporating “vibrant and colourful visuals.” The title is called the “most fun” project from incubation, and multiple game modes are in the works. The title will also feature a class system with roles such as Support, Attack, and Defence. There will also be a social aspect to the game, where players can interact with each other between matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last we heard about Bungie’s Gummy Bears MOBA was in 2023 when it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-new-game-to-use-unreal-engine-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PvP title was being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>. Since then, the project has been handed over to a new PlayStation Studio, where 40 Bungie devs have joined the team to carry out the development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a former executive claimed that Bungie hired fans <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as they would work for less money</a>. Also, the former Marathon Director has sued Bungie and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over alleged inappropriate contact</a>.

While the upscaler can upscale smaller resolutions to 4K, newer graphics technology such as frame generation can come at the cost of additional latency. This means that while you are getting additional frames, your games may not feel quite as responsive as a result. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GPU manufacturers AMD and Nvidia have sought to resolve this through Radeon Anti-Lag and Nvidia Reflex respectively, and now it appears Sony may develop a solution of its own.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/13/sony-patent-with-camera-sensor-example-1736771044695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This new Sony patent could be a game-changer for PlayStation. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech4gamers</a>, the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025010132" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony patent WO2025010132</a>, titled “TIMED INPUT/ACTION RELEASE,” is designed to tackle and streamline the “timed release of user commands” via predicting what button you’re going to press next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s rationale for the filing reads: “there can be latency between the user's input action and the system's subsequent processing and execution of the command. This in turn results in delayed execution of the command and unintended consequences in the game itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The solution is described as having several parts running in conjunction: a machine-learning AI model designed to predict what input you are going to receive next, and an external sensor, with the example of a camera pointed at your controller to determine which input you are getting ready to press. “In one particular example, the method may include providing camera input as an input to a machine learning (ML) model,” the patent reads. “The camera input may indicate the first user command.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another potential use includes the sensor being a controller button itself. Considering that Sony has been a champion for analog buttons in the past, the company may use them in a next-generation controller.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the technology as described in the patent might not make its way exactly as described in the PlayStation 6 (filings like these hardly ever do), it clearly shows that the company is looking to adopt similar technologies to cut down on latency without games feeling less responsive, especially considering the popularity of rendering tech like FSR 3 and DLSS 3, which add additional frame latency on whatever system they run on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will most likely benefit real-world scenarios like twitch shooters, which require both high framerates and low latency. But, whether or not this patent gets used in future hardware remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charity speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has come to a close, and the event has raised a huge amount of money for charity organization Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, AGDQ 2025 has raised a grand total of $2,556,305 for the cancer charity, which advocates for cancer prevention and early detection. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation" rel="nofollow">around the same amount raised</a> during Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 and slightly more than AGDQ 2024's total.</p>

<p>Like last year's event (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-cancels-in-person-event" rel="nofollow">not the previous year's</a>), AGDQ 2025 took place over a seven-day period in Pittsburgh, PA, with over 2,000 people attending the event and "tens of thousands" of people streaming it online.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-awesome-games-done-quick-2025.jpg?itok=QtM_4ahR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-awesome-games-done-quick-2025.jpg?itok=S5BrogOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games were streamed during Awesome Games Done Quick 2025, including&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect if you've seen an AGDQ event before, many games were streamed during this year's marathon, and some of them enjoyed some pretty wacky accompaniments too.</p>

<p>Highlights, as a press release points out, include Dr. Doot's saxophone-driven&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>stream (which you can see below), as well as an actual opera performance by Xem upon completion of his&nbsp;run of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando</em>.</p>

<p>You may also have seen FunkopotamusWes playing&nbsp;<em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii&nbsp;</em>using his head and feet while using his hands to play the piano, then doing the same while blindfolded. No wonder the amount raised for charity was so high.</p>

<p>Lest you think AGDQ 2025 focused only on good games, though, think again; the Awful Block segment featured streamers playing through games like the legendarily godawful&nbsp;<em>Superman 64&nbsp;</em>and the just-plain-weird&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Grandmother</em>.</p>




<p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 concluded on Sunday morning with a&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid&nbsp;</em>run, which feels like a nice, classic way to bring proceedings to a close.</p>

<p>If you missed any of the runs that took place during AGDQ 2025, you can check them all out via the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamesdonequick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Games Done Quick YouTube channel</a>. You can also still make a donation to Prevent Cancer Foundation <a href="https://preventcancer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a> if you'd like to.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries">MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</a> support studio Toadman Interactive have been shuttered by parent company Enad Global 7 as part of "<a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/enad-global-7-initiates-a-wind-down-of-the-operations-in-toadman/">cost-saving measures</a>". This follows the studio closing down offices in Stockholm, Visby, and Oslo last November, as well as a number of redundancies at their Berlin studio. Toadman - who also developed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> Immortal: Unchained and provided support work for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>   - employed 69 people at the time of closure.</p>

<p>This coincides with Enad Global 7 laying off "approximately" 38 people at Piranha Games, whose latest series entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior">MechWarrior</a> 5: Clans "performed below expectations". Enad Global 7's CEO Ji Ham said <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/">the following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The team at Piranha truly delivered a high-quality game that exceeded both internal as well as external expectations in terms of quality, story and gameplay. Despite the phenomenal work by the team at Piranha, the game failed to reach new audiences and expand its core audience as anticipated and therefore has not met the necessary sales targets, which has forced us to undertake necessary actions."</p></blockquote>
<p>Piranha have been the de facto custodians of the MechWarrior series since releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechwarrior-online">MechWarrior Online</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">Eurogamer report</a>, Enad Global 7's restructuring echoes a spate of other recent studio closures in 2025 already, those being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down">Robocraft 2 developer Freejam</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/godfall">Godfall</a>'s Counterplay Games. Last week, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a> developer Splash Damage had cancelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a>, with "a number of roles…potentially at risk of redundancy".</p><p>Best wishes to all affected. A Toadman developer once sent me a key for Immortal: Unchained after I met him at a bar in Stockholm. He also showed me where the tube station was at 4am. I was not in a fit state to otherwise locate the tube station on my own initiative, so this was much appreciated.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Verdansk is reportedly returning to Warzone during Season 3, which will be around mid-April 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to TheGhostofHope, who has accurately leaked Call of Duty details in the past.</p>



<p>Taking to X (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1878501659413754048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hope replied</a> to someone asking him to “leak Verdansk to wake them [Activision] up,” to which Hope replied, “S3,” referring to Season 3.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming first heard that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in December 2023</a>, which was said to be a move directly following the success of OG Fortnite, where Epic Games brought back the game’s original map with tremendous success. Originally slated for a December 2024 release, the map would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Spring 2025</a>. </p>



<p>Activision confirmed the leaks in August 2024 during CODNEXT, where it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk would return in 2025</a>. Hope’s tweet suggests that we will not be getting it during Season 2, and instead in Season 3, meaning that we’re still a few months away from release. </p>



<p>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 lasted 70 days, suggesting that we’ll get the return of Verdansk around mid-April, unless the map is released during a mid-Season update, which would come around late May.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdansk-took-call-of-duty-to-new-heights">Verdansk Took Call of Duty to New Heights</h2>



<p>First released in 2020, Verdansk and Call of Duty Warzone took the Call of Duty franchise to new heights. The game, which was the first free-to-play Call of Duty ever was a tremendous success with Call of Duty players and saw the game reach its highest concrruent player numbers in history.Revenue also followed, making Activision billions of dollars in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Following the successful release of OG Fortnite, which saw Fortnite’s player base revived, Activision are seemingly hoping that Verdansk will have similar results. </p>



<p>But as of the time of writing, Call of Duty has had serious issues with bugs and hackers, making the game unplayable to most. So here’s hoping that those issues will be squashed before the release of Verdansk.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk’s return</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment is entering a new venture in more ways than one. The main thing is, obviously, that they are going to publish their first multiplayer game (with the exception of Death Really, which is really a unique title in their portfolio) since their foundation in 1995. This means having to come up with entirely different level design approaches and character progression systems, not to mention needing to inject some actual teamwork into the gameplay and, of course, making sure that the online infrastructure is solid.</p>
<p>But there's another noteworthy way in which FBC: Firebreak will differ from previous Remedy titles. Historically, the studio always pushed the graphics and technological envelop, from Max Payne to Alan Wake, Control (one of the best ray tracing showcases), and Alan Wake 2 (one of the only path traced games on the market). This inevitably came with relatively high PC requirements at the time of the titles' respective releases.&nbsp;However, that won't be the case with FBC: Firebreak, as Remedy Communications Director Thomas Puha <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/after-alan-wake-2-and-control-fbc-firebreak-represents-a-bold-new-frontier-for-remedy-its-time-to-expand-the-remedy-connected-universe-into-shared-spaces-and-brave-something-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gamesradar</a>.</p>
<p><em>We are pretty conscious of keeping the minimum required PC spec reasonable, and not going so high with the requirements as we did with Control and Alan Wake 2. We'll still have great graphics and visual effects, all that you expect from Remedy, but in a multiplayer experience like this, framerate is king as well as the responsiveness of the controls.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the screenshots and footage released so far clearly show that it won't be a visual showcase like their usual single player games. However, as Puha said, that's understandable; after all, most multiplayer games follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>In the Gamesradar interview, Remedy also explained that they want to get the game into as many hands as possible, which is why it'll be available on both PlayStation Plus and Game Pass at launch. There's no launch window yet, but FBC: Firebreak is expected to debut later this year.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Saber Interactive | Release Date: September 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p>It seems crazy that it took this long for someone to really nail what it feels like to play as a Space Marine for the <em>Warhammer 40K </em>universe. Obviously, this is a sequel to a first solid attempt at that game, but it wasn't quite there. Now, though, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is the ultimate <em>40K </em>fantasy.</p>

<p><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s co-op is set up in a classic way. Honestly, there's nothing more to it than you can just join up with some friends to absolutely demolish people as a squad of Space Marines. Because the gameplay is so visceral and the visual design so perfectly captures that universe, you can't help yourself but have a good time.</p>

<p>It isn't often we're treated with some really fun co-op experiences, but you owe it to yourself to try out <em>Space Marine 2</em>, especially if you're into <em>Warhammer</em>.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>Ever since I played it while it was in beta over the summer, I felt something I hadn't felt in a while: low-pressure competitive joy. It reminds me of the early days of <em>Overwatch </em>(in more ways than one). No matter which character you play, it's fairly easy to feel effective, but games are also just short enough that if you royally screw up, the opportunity to redeem yourself is around the corner.</p>

<p>The Team-Up Abilities also feel like an innovative take on hero selection. Pairing up two heroes who benefit each other gives you a slight edge, but it never feels like it breaks the game. Instead, it's a lore-friendly way to strategize your picks, playing into the rich history of Marvel stories that are on offer.</p>

<p>We're just getting into season 1 now, which has introduced Reed Richards and the Invisible Woman, with The Thing and the Human Torch just around the corner. Already, that's an impressive amount of support for a hero shooter that could really shake up the somewhat stale genre.</p>

<h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Dan Rockwood</p>

<p>In 2024, no game captured the chaos and camaraderie of fighting on a united front better than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Not only is it super fun to coordinate calling in stratagems that will bomb entire acres of a map, but on higher difficulty levels <em>Helldivers 2</em> requires optimized teamwork to keep from being overrun by Terminids, Automatons and, most recently, the Illuminate.</p>

<p>When you are battling alone, outgunned and outnumbered, there's no greater feeling than a friendly ship coming out of hyperspace, the fresh Hellpod deploying, screaming through the atmosphere like a missile until it slams into the ground, releasing a new Helldiver to help turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em> seamlessly integrates and relies on cross-platform coordination and cooperative play to win missions but doesn't shy away from the hilarity of accidentally (or intentionally) dropping a 500 kg bomb on one of your friends or napalming an extraction point moments before evacuation. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is among the greatest multiplayer experiences of the past decade, and with frequent updates and an ever-evolving story, it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

<p>The heavily rumored Hatsune Miku Fortnite skin has leaked online and players are not happy with the design.</p>



<p>Hatsune Miku’s Fortnite skin came courtesy of Fortnite leaker and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Wensoing</a>, who posted the images over on their X (formerly Twitter) account. You can see the skin below: </p>



<div><article><p><span>dread it. run from it. destiny arrives all the same. and now it’s here.</span></p></article></div>



<p>According to the dataminer, Miku will also have a Fortnite Lego skin, but images are yet to be posted online.</p>



<p>Despite the rumored skin having fans wondering when it will come for months, fans of Hatsune Miku seem to be somewhat disappointed by how the skin looks, with many criticizing how her face looks in-game. </p>



<p>“That face is so wrong lol. The rest is very solid but it’s incredibly distracting at how off the face is,” said Reddit user suika_melon. “looks nothing like her official models,” said LolcatP. </p>



<p>Fortnite Festival launches on January 14, 2026, and brings local multiplayer for the first time.</p>



<p>“Get the band back together on January 14! The launch of Festival Season 7 comes with a new local multiplayer feature on Xbox and PlayStation! In a local play session of Festival Main Stage, up to four players can play together on the same console,” the official gamer description of Fortnite Festival Season 7 reads.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Fortnite Festival on Jan 14th? What do you think of the new Hatsune Miku skin? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>The animator behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film credits has detailed the creation of its low poly character models, including the first ever Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Each of the Sonic films has had a retro-themed credits sequence, gradually moving from 2D pixels to the low poly 3D models in this film, which were based on arcade game Sonic the Fighters.</p>
<p>However, with the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog in the film, this provided an opportunity to create a Classic Shadow model for the first time.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka told GameInformer (thanks <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/takashi-iizuka-says-it-again-shadow-will-not-appear-in-classic-sonic-games-r1352/">Sonic Stadium</a>) during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> preview that Shadow would not be mixing with classic characters.</p>
<p>"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," he said. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series."</p>
<p>Then, with last year's Sonic x Shadow Generations,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia"> Iizuka confirmed to Eurogamer before its release</a> there would be no Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Yet animator suitNtie managed to do it, which he's detailed in a new video discussing the creation of the credits.</p>
<p>"[Shadow's design] is something that is probably one of the most important things to me on the project," he said.</p>
<p>"It feels almost like [Sega is] allergic to this idea completely. So I was really sceptical if I was going to be able to."</p>
<p>The model itself was based on the same used for Sonic, but with a few tweaks: the colour scheme, of course, as well as the shoes and eyeliner.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/I-worked-on-Sonic-3.-13-22-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>These low poly models are such a thrill for fans | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sega / Paramount / Picturemill</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"But then it came down to the torso - what I would consider Classic Sonic's main thing is the torso and also the proportions," he continued, pointing to the model's round body design. "Will they want the more normal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>-style body, instead of this Classic one?</p>
<p>"If you watch the movie you see that it's Classic Shadow! I got Classic Shadow in an official Sonic product!"</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the video, suitNtie discusses how he got the job. At the end of 2023 he was laid off from his job as a VFX artist in the games industry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">similarly to so many employees</a>. It's great, therefore, to see such a success story emerging from its aftermath.</p>
<p>In addition to the video, the animator has shared a thread on X discussing some extra titbits, including how he tried to sneak a Dreamcast console into the background.</p>

<p>Pokemon GO developers have revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be discontinued in 2025. The list of affected devices is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/32-bit-android-discontinued-support-2025?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Pokemon GO devs revealed that support for 32-bit Android devices will be stopped to “streamline” their development process and shift resources to support “newer operating systems and technologies.” After the upcoming update, only 32-bit Android devices will be affected; 64-bit and iOS users don’t have to do anything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From March 2025, Pokemon GO will no longer be accessible for 32-bit users who downloaded the game from the Samsung Galaxy Store. Support for players who downloaded the game from the Google Play Store will end in June 2025. After this date, players will not be able to access their Pokemon GO accounts, items, or PokéCoins once the update is live. They must log in with the same credentials on a new 64-bit device to continue playing the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is a list of 32-bit Android devices that you won’t be able to play Pokemon GO on in the near future:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, Note 3, J3</li>



<li>Sony Xperia Z2, Z3</li>



<li>Motorola Moto G (1st generation)</li>



<li>LG Fortune, Tribute</li>



<li>OnePlus One</li>



<li>HTC One (M8)</li>



<li>ZTE Overture 3</li>



<li>Certain Android devices released before 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 developers Larian Studios have shifted the team’s entire focus to their next game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-devs-shift-full-attention-to-their-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs stated, “Swen and the team[‘s]… full attention is focused on crafting their next title”. The report also reveals that the development studio will be entering a “media blackout” until further notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, spoke about the studio’s journey in a new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1877608305452892504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, stating that there’s much more to come from them in the future. While reposting the “Larian Studios: From Bankruptcy To Baldur’s Gate 3” YouTube video, Vincke stated that it has been “an incredible journey so far. But the story isn’t over yet. Stay Tuned.”</p>



<p>Back in March 2024, Baldur’s Gate 3 devs revealed that they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be working on a DLC or sequel</a> for the series but on something “new.” Since then, it has been revealed that Larian Studios is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently working on two new projects</a> while continuing to provide support to 2023’s game of the year.</p>



<p>If you are worried about the next Baldur’s Gate title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-4-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasbro has expressed interest in creating it</a>. However, they are in the process of finding the right partners to develop the franchise’s next entry. Baldur’s Gate 3 actors have also shown interest in working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-actors-interested-in-new-dd-game-or-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new Dungeons and Dragons game or movie</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited accessories manufacturer Genki on the CES trade show floor last week, a reporter has claimed, after videos of its dummy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console went viral.
</p>
<p>
High profile French tech journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVsoHCgXk">Julien Tellouck</a> was one of several reporters to stop by Genki's CES booth last Friday, when he claimed the company had been dropped in on by Nintendo lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Images of Genki's mock-up Switch 2 unit - which the company's chatty CEO initially claimed was based on the actual final design of Nintendo's under-wraps console - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">spread across the internet last week</a>. Clearly, Nintendo noticed.

<p>
According to Tellouck, though, Genki simply told Nintendo it had never signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company and therefore hadn't technically broken any rules.
</p>
<p>
"I talked to the guy from Genki just behind me, he told me that Nintendo had stopped by with lawyers - they had nothing to be reprimanded for because they had never signed a paper with Nintendo - no confidentiality agreement, no NDA," Tellouck said. "So the Japanese brand are quiet. 
</p>
<p>
"On the other hand, [Genki] told me that they were sure that the Nintendo Switch 2 - except for a few details - would look like this 3D prototype."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps notably, by the end of last week <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">Genki had decided to make clear it hadn't actually seen Switch 2 itself</a> - after previously saying it was aware that units were now available on the black market.
</p>
<p>Last Friday finally also brought an acknowledgement of the leaks by Nintendo. Speaking to Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">Nintendo spokesperson simply stated the images and videos from CES were "not official"</a>.</p>
<p>With details of the Switch 2's hardware design spreading, further leaks have also begun detailing Switch 2's third-party software line-up. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">Microsoft will reportedly be a major supporter, alongside Square Enix with multiple Final Fantasy titles</a>. Surely, after months of waiting, official word is now imminent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For those excited about this sci-fi title, you won't have long to wait, as it's set to release at the end of this month when you'll finally get to dive into this world and explore the Starward Belt.

<h2>Usual June (TBA)</h2>
<p>While Usual June doesn't have a release date just yet, it is set to release at some point this year. This title is made by Finji, the developer behind the hit game Tunic.

<h2>Slay the Spire 2</h2>

Mega Crit has been hard at work and has been releasing regular updates about the development process.&nbsp; There will be some familiar faces but also some new ones and plenty of new relics and cards to get to know and experiment with. At the moment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slay the Spire 2</a> doesn't have an official release date, but it is due for release this year, albeit in early access.</p>

            <p>EEK3 is the alternative showcase of small horror game creators that amalgamates every year like a shell of flies around the corpse of E3. It's a lot of fun for people who enjoy ye olde PS1 aesthetics and foggy throwback horror. The 2024 showcase was supposed to happen in time for Halloween, the night when the spirits of old platformer mascots rise from their graves to gift polygons to small children. But it was postponed due to technical problems. Only now has the 2-hour showcase of game trailers emerged, culminating in a new Haunted PS1 demo disc packed with upcoming games. "The curse," say the organisers, "is lifted." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are over 70 games shown off. As you can imagine, it's quite a long show. But I heard you have lots of time on your hands. It's a whole new year. And if you need it, here's <a href="https://www.moyahorror.com/eek3-games-list">a full list of all the games</a> on show. </p>

<p>There are more than a few stand-outs among the lo-fi horror. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-of-husks">Prison Of Husks</a> is a sword swinger set in a medieval castleland reminiscent of Lordran from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/angeline-era">Angeline Era</a> is a colourful and bumpy hack 'n' slash from the creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> RPGs. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/of-love-and-eternity">Of Love And Eternity</a> is an attractively pixelated knightly romance - and by romance I mean your love was killed and so were you and now you are in a hellish skull-filled country where you have to use a lantern full of glowbugs to see the bone-littered path in front of you. We last saw it demoed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-love-and-eternity-is-a-scary-walk-with-good-noises">back in 2021</a>.</p><p>There are probably a ton of other promising entries - I haven't got through the whole show yet. But I spy some familiar faces coming down the gore tubes. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trip">Trip</a> is the funny, bright timeloop caper<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trip-is-a-pleasant-train-journey-with-normal-folk-like-this-unblinking-child-who-speaks-only-in-dark-symbols"> I tried in autumn</a>. And the grasping hand of non-euclidean horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eclipsium">Eclipsium</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-worth-downloading-the-demo-for-uncanny-horror-eclipsium-just-to-stare-at-your-hands">got Nic cooing</a>. And, oh look, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> also gets a shout-out, despite the fact the hot pink horror with horny demons already released in November (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-were-closed-review">Ed reviewed it</a>, in case you're wondering). This is probably just a hangover result of the showcase's long delay. </p>
<p>Still, yes, 70 games. That's a lot of ground to cover. Thankfully, the Haunted PS1 demo disc which accompanies the showcase is not quite so overwhelming. It only has 24 demos to try out. These demo discs have often been the delightfully fetid source of quiet hits. Parkour rock climbing game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> was first featured on the demo disc back in 2021, for example. And one of my favourite games of last year, the Elder Scrolls-inspired <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, first appeared on the 2020 disc.</p>
<p>In short, the Haunted PS1 folks have a good track record for curating interesting stuff, and every disc has a fun framing device that makes it a game in itself. This year, a ritual has wrong, say the creators, and it has manifested a two-sided disc, with one side devoted to fearsome freakery and the other devoted to cute nostalgia. You can <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demo-disc-flipside-frights">download the demo disc on Itch</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've always wished there was a game workers equivalent of gobbing in an especially rude customer's cheeseburger. Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html">new policy</a> outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are instances where certain customers take actions directly or through our support centers, or towards our group executives, employees, partners who are involved in the creation and distribution of our group products and services, that constitute ‘customer harassment," reads the statement as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-square-enix-policy-aims-to-protect-employees-from-toxic-fans/">Very Gary Computing</a>, "such as denial of personality, violence, defamation, intimidation, advance notice of wrongdoing, advance notice of obstruction of business, harassment."</p>
<p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security," they continue, "but also causes disruptions to other customers. Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary". The action in question being to "cease providing support services or to refrain from providing our group’s products and services.”</p>
<p>Here's their list of absolutely Gaialess behaviour in full:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Harassment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Act of violence, violent behavior</li>
<li>Abusive language, intimidation, coercion, duress, excessive pursuit or reprimand</li>
<li>Defamation/slander, denial of personality, personal attack (including email, contact in contact form, comment or post on the internet), advance notice of wrongdoing, advance notice of obstruction of business</li>
<li>Persistent inquiries, repeated visits</li>
<li>Trespassing by visiting or staying in an office or related facility without permission</li>
<li>Unlawful restraint including via telephone calls and online inquiries</li>
<li>Discriminatory speech and conduct regarding race, ethnicity, religion, family origin, occupation, etc.</li>
<li>Infringement of privacy by taking pictures or making video recordings without consent</li>
<li>Sexual harassment, stalking, repeated stalking behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Undue demand:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Unreasonable changes or exchange of product or request for monetary compensation</li>
<li>Unreasonable response or request for an apology (including face-to-face response or request for an apology specifying the position of our employee or partners)</li>
<li>Excessive requests for the provision of products and services exceeding socially accepted norms</li>
<li>Unreasonable and excessive demands for punishment of our employees</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As VGC highlight, Briana White has previously <a href="https://x.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1869877671628607729">spoken out online</a> to request that "shippers" please relax. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> features a love triangle between her character Aerith, protagonist Cloud, and his childhood friend Tifa - a secondary story element that a certain subset of the audience have historically taken far too seriously, which has apparently spilled over into real-life harassment of White.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I imagine the bulk of this is mostly the kind of boilerplate you find in policies about harassment, rather than responses to any specific incident. Although the line "unreasonable changes or exchange of product or request for monetary compensation" requires a bit of good faith that Square Enix's idea of "unreasonable" is in line with everyone else's.</p><p>Again, though, it seems mostly like covering bases to me. I imagine the "unreasonable and excessive demands for punishment of our employees" line rings depressingly true to anyone who's ever seen the sheer catastrophic levels of entitlement floating around on social media from people who feel that buying one (1) videogame gives them the right to attempt to purge workers they disagree with. Love to be a human on the internet in 2025. Love it.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s creative director has revealed how involved Arrowhead Game Studios will be with the upcoming movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-movie-arrowhead-wont-have-final-say" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, Johan Pilestedt recently posted a photo of the Helldivers 2 team having a meal together on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1877764599409221678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In the comment section of this post, the creative director was asked whether Arrowhead would be involved in the upcoming Helldivers movie’s production. Pilestedt responded, “The short answer is yes. The long answer is that we’ll see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that Arrowhead Studios are game developers and not “Hollywood people,” so they are unaware of “what it takes to make a movie.” The director concluded by stating, “Therefore, we don’t, and shouldn’t, have the final say” in the production of the upcoming Helldivers movie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about the Helldivers movie, the announcement arrived from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony at CES 2025</a>. During the same event, they announced other adaptations too, such as a live-action movie for Horizon Zero Dawn and an anime adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-announces-ghost-of-tsushima-anime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</a>, the online multiplayer experience of Sucker Punch’s 2020 action-adventure game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 developers have already begun fleshing out the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high concept’ for the team’s next game</a>. Also, the title was Insider Gaming Community’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-multiplayer-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Best Multiplayer Game” of 2024</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-review.1080624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel has inspired countless adaptations, to the point where it can be hard to make these now familiar characters and stories fresh again. But after spending 60 hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins, its rebooted tale of politics, war, and diplomacy felt almost as new as the first time I discovered it. It ups the scale of its battles beyond what even this series has been known for, with more enemies on screen than ever before to truly create that “1 vs. 1000” fantasy. Pair that with improved visuals, a much deeper and more refined focus on its combat, impressive storytelling, and a wealth of postgame content and Origins has easily become my favorite Dynasty Warriors yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Romance of the Three Kingdoms’ broader storylines are often the driving force behind some of Dynasty Warriors’ biggest battles, the real focus and draw of this series has always been the action itself. The moments that have stuck with me most involve taking down hundreds of opponents at once, with fights against legendary warriors like Lu Bu usually just adding a bit of flavor to that carnage. However, with Origins, Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have balanced the scales between story and combat. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dynasty Warriors: Origins Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike previous games, which had you pick a storyline and then swap between legendary lords like Liu Bei, Sun Ce, or Cao Cao, here you take on the singular role of a brand new character created specifically for Origins. The trope of your hero being <em>yet another</em> wandering warrior suffering from amnesia is a bit cliche, but it works surprisingly well. This more focused storyline takes you through the earlier years of prominent Three Kingdoms characters before their rise to glory, letting you travel across multiple provinces and lend your talents to whichever army needs you. And although I did miss the ability to play as those well known officers like Guan Yu for entire missions, Origins at least gives you the option to take control of them temporarily in some specific levels, which is a nice compromise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There isn't much choice in the early chapters as you join iconic events like the quelling of the Yellow Turban army and the rise and fall of Dong Zhuo. But that all changes when you reach the midpoint of the roughly 45-hour (if you take the time to do all the side activities) campaign, as you must choose an alliance and lord to join permanently, which shapes your perspective throughout the rest of the story. I first chose the small but competent Shu clan, following Liu Bei's optimism and selflessness through the highs and lows of his rise to power. Thankfully, after seeing the end of one storyline, Origins makes it very easy to either jump back in and replay any battle you want or restart from specific points in each chapter, letting you see how the story unfolds when you choose one of the other alliances. Meeting certain conditions in each of those branching stories will even unlock the “true endings” of the saga, which I am still happily working towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Origins puts a little more romance into the Three Kingdoms.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the five chapters, there is also a secondary storyline that involves the recovery of your lost memories, slowly explaining the wanderer's role in the grander tale that unfolds. It’s filled with engaging conversations and cutscenes across a large cast of interesting characters, which adds levity and intrigue to help balance out the more exposition-heavy dialogue that focuses on the events of each battle or the various betrayals and alliances happening around them. The only real downside and oddity of your main character is that he is often emotionless – and when he does emote, it is extremely subtle, which sometimes hurts the emotional depth of certain story moments; he also doesn't speak except for generic shouts during battle when you dodge, parry, or take down an officer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you encounter other prominent warriors in battle, you will occasionally find them afterward on the world map, allowing you to deepen your bond with them. Each bond has five levels, and progressing through them provides bonuses like collectible coins that offer regular rewards as you grow your collection. The final bond level even unlocks a more intimate cutscene between you and that character, and these conversations ended up being some of my favorites. For example, avoiding spoilers, it was surprisingly touching when one famous general asked me to join them for a drink so they could etch the features of my face and the sound of my voice into their memory. The characters speak so eloquently and with such reverence that it can often read as romantic interest, although none of the dozens of bonds I completed ever explicitly led to that. Still, Koei Tecmo certainly put a little bit more romance into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and I, for one, couldn't be happier about it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Art of War</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">They say war never changes, but the weapons of war sure do. You may just begin with a sword and some very simple special attacks (known as Battle Arts), but you’ll not only unlock more options as you go, you’ll also gain proficiency with each one in order to unlock new combos and stronger abilities. That system encouraged me to keep using weapons I otherwise might not, even if my initial experience with them wasn’t great. For example, The wheels weapon, which is one I've enjoyed in the past, just didn't seem to have the wave clear or damage potential of weapons like the crescent blade or gauntlets when I first unlocked it – but after increasing its proficiency a bit, I eventually discovered its potential in staggering enemy officers and its ability to shred through their defenses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are eight additional weapon types to unlock either by defeating specific generals or purchasing them in shops, and I generally found myself with a new one by the time I had gained three or four levels of proficiency with my current one, preventing combat from ever getting stale. Each weapon has a distinct identity that fills in nicely for Origins’ lack of switching characters, especially when you can swap between them in the middle of a mission to gain proficiency with multiple weapons per stage and adapt to the evolving situation of a battle. It quickly became apparent which weapons were ideal for me to take down as many enemies as fast as possible, especially in the latter chapters, where taking too long in one fight could mean not reaching allies in time to save them. While every weapon is designed to work in all situations, there are inherent benefits to using something like the wide-hitting lance against crowds, which also has an Endure mechanic that stores damage taken and turns it back on your enemies with improved power while restoring your health over time. Meanwhile, whenever I found myself locked in a duel with a powerful foe, it was time to bring out my gauntlets thanks to their ability to easily knock up and juggle my opponents until it was done. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The spectacle of the Ultimate Musou Attacks match their power.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every weapon has its own set of Battle Arts, which consume a resource called Bravery and range from wide sweeping attacks to powerful repeated thrusts to various counterattacks. The more powerful and exciting ones even give you the ability to summon small tornadoes that sweep up enemies, make spires of earth that deal constant damage to anyone touching them, or (one of my personal favorites) create a laser of light fired from your fingertips that can pierce and knock up groups for as long as you hold the button down or until you run out Bravery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravery is accumulated by landing hits on enemies, parrying strikes, or perfectly evading attacks after unlocking a specific skill on the skill tree. Parries and perfect evasions look better than ever and come with large benefits in combat; parrying attacks immediately opens up enemies to counterattacks, ending their combos and making them susceptible to knock-ups. Meanwhile, perfect evasions generate Bravery more quickly as you can chain dodges to restore more with each combo. These mechanics add depth to the combat and help keep fights interesting beyond just seeing how many KO’s I could get while slaughtering armies. In addition to your Battle Arts, you also have access to the all-powerful Musou Attacks that the series is known for, as well as a rage mode that refills your Bravery instantly, restores health on hits, and enables an even stronger Ultimate Musou Attack. The spectacle of these moves match their power, and it was always a rush to see 1000 KO’s pop up simultaneously when I timed one right. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While on the battlefield, you also gain access to numerous Tactics that can help turn the tide of battle when deployed properly. For instance, using your squad to rain down fire arrows in the heat of battle can deal some good damage and weaken the opposing troop's numbers – however, moving to higher ground before unleashing them will result in a much more dramatic success, increasing the damage to their health and morale, which gives you some welcome strategic choices to make beyond simply using these moves whenever they come off cooldown. Those cooldowns can be quite lengthy, too, so these Tactics became extremely valuable for assisting officers in danger or softening up enemies to strike them down quicker. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The power fantasy of quickly devastating huge hordes of foes with ease is one of the things I love about Dynasty Warriors, and I'm happy to report that feeling is still alive and well here. However, as you turn up the difficulty, it also becomes increasingly important to utilize the defensive options at your disposal, which adds satisfying wrinkles for those who want to face them. Mastering these techniques is important on the higher Hero difficulty and essential on the Ultimate difficulty that unlocks after completing the main story – there, enemy combos will quickly deplete your health, and the more aggressive AI isn’t afraid to attack you from multiple angles at the same time, meaning one wrong move can easily lead to mission failure. I had a blast taking on this added challenge as I replayed previous missions, making enemy officers stronger and healthier but also dropping higher tiers of rewards. Some missions also carry special challenges, such as completing them within a shorter time limit, defeating specific officers, and capturing certain bases to unlock new rewards, making it even more worth my time to revisit them. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Musou Games Unranked.</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, Origins puts you on a gorgeous map filled with mountains, rivers, and forests, giving it the appearance of a living diorama built for strategic planning. That map is filled with numerous markers for missions to complete, skirmishes to take on, resources to collect, officers to talk to, and towns to shop in. Its 10 provinces are large enough to warrant a fast travel system of its own, but still small enough to conveniently get anywhere you need to in just a minute or two. In addition to the main story missions, side missions offer rewards like new accessories to boost your stats or more guards to improve your Tactics, while skirmishes are bite-sized, two-to-three-minute encounters that are great for earning extra money or completing the various challenges given to you by other officers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of these challenges are easy tasks like killing 100 enemies with strong attacks from a spear, but I enjoyed using skirmishes as a way to handle them so that I could tackle the main missions without having to do something like limit myself to a specific weapon. The trickiest of these challenges (which I wish there were more of) required me to win five duels without taking damage – that was genuinely tough and required quite a few restarts to finish quickly, but it helped hone my skill in duels. They were also always worthwhile to complete as they rewarded me humorous or deeper conversations with some of my favorite characters, and provided bonus skill points to unlock the next thing on my skill trees. Both skirmishes and challenges became a great way to try out new builds, too, as well as a nice way to sprinkle in some action when the story reached moments of multiple back-to-back cutscenes.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> will receive its first major patch later this week, 0.1.1, which primarily brings some big changes to endgame content.</p>
<p>More is planned for a future update too, as game director Jonathan Rogers explained in a new video (below).</p>
<p>"We have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make," he said. "And one of the best things about having the game in early access with the endgame, is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character powers to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relevant to that. But, those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league and a new economy for people to play in.</p>

<p>"That's still a little while away yet, but in the meantime we'll be continuing to identify things that are causing frustration and try and address them."</p>
<p>So what are the biggest changes?</p>
<p>Firstly, maps have received balance tweaks to the likes of monsters, chests, essences, and other materials. This is to ensure maps are more rewarding to explore.</p>
<p>Four new towers have also been added, as only one tower map was available previously, in order to improve variety. The existing map has also been "redone" to "make playing there less boring".</p>
<p>More maps with bosses will also be spawned as the rate was previously incorrect. What's more, Pinnacle content currently takes too long to reach and players have only one attempt at the boss. Now Citadels will spawn within closer reach on the map, and six respawn attempts will be provided on bosses - though only on the Arbiter of Ash boss so far.</p><p>Other quality of life changes include: better visibility of attack effects thanks to reduced clutter on maps; tweaks to strongboxes to spawn monsters more quickly; an increased zoom level on the Atlas; removal of terrain collision issues; the ability to overwrite item sockets with new runes; and other boss balance changes.</p>
<p>Full patch notes will be revealed later this week when the patch arrives. For now, check out the video above for details.</p>
<p>Developer Grinding Gear Games admitted back in December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">Path of Exile 2 was "not rewarding enough"</a> and listed a number of tweaks it's been working on. It's clear, then, the developer is not slowing down now the game is out in early access.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For a moment there we were genuinely worried about what the future had in store for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a>. Despite being a flagship franchise for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> over the years, it began to feel starved of innovation, rehashing the same core mechanics and retreading the same old story. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9 tried to do something drastically different</a> with its open-world setup but this was poorly executed, leaving players to explore barren landscapes populated by braindead enemy warbands. The fact that Nioh developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> recently did their own spin on the Three Kingdoms story with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> also hinted at DW’s uncertain future. However, it appears that Omega Force had been biding its time, going back to the drawing board, and rebuilding its beloved hack n’ slash epic from scratch instead of tacking a few new shiny features on a much-fatigued formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dynasty Warriors Origins - Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEJj6ahC38s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the name implies, Origins is a reboot, and an ideal entry point for both new and lapsed fans. At the same time, this latest Dynasty Warriors game feels like it was made for series diehards, revising and reworking just about every core aspect while layering on intriguing new gameplay systems.</p>


<p>For the uninitiated, Dynasty Warriors is a historical action game set in Ancient China and based on Luo Guanzhong’s epic novel, “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”. While there have been 9 mainline entries in the series, each one has retold the same story over and over albeit with shinier graphics and incremental changes to the frenzied, hack n’ slash gameplay. DW has always been about “1 versus 1,000” battles where players obliterate entire armies by hammering out button combos and special “Musou” attacks.</p>
<p>Despite the many changes Omega Force has made in Dynasty Warriors: Origins, that concept is still at the very centre of the experience. If anything it has become more galvanised thanks to smartly evolved combat mechanics and the enhanced cinematic atmosphere of large-scale battles.</p>


<p>Hearing that Dynasty Warriors: Origins would only feature a limited roster of playable characters and weapons seemed like a major red flag. Dynasty Warriors 9 included almost 100 generals; a core part of the DW experience has been playing through each campaign to unlock new characters. However, this big change makes perfect sense from both in terms of narrative and gameplay.</p>
<p>Instead of selecting a faction and watching the events of the Three Kingdoms saga play out from their perspective, you are the ‘Wanderer’, a mysterious fighter with a hidden past who, during those early chapters of the story, remains neutral. It’s a clever change-up and one that allows you interact with various characters from each faction before ultimately deciding who to align with whereas previous games forced players to choose Shu, Wu, or Weight straight off the bat with little to no preamble.</p>
<p>If there’s one niggling flaw with the story, it’s the new cast ethereal characters who help the Wanderer piece together memories of his past life. They steer the game’s narrative in a slightly more supernatural directional though thankfully this doesn’t overshadow the historical Three Kingdoms timeline, giving fan favourite characters more time to shine.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, even though many of them aren’t directly playable, in Origins it feels like you learn more about each character through various cutscenes and other interactions. This is helped by the presence of English voiceovers. One gripe we’ve had with other games in the wider Musou franchise is the disconnect when attempting to read subtitles in the heat of battle, often missing vital information and a sense of atmosphere. Something else noticeable is the shift away from over-the-top caricature representations of certain historic figures such as Zhang Jiao and Dong Zhuo who are instead given some added thought and depth in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the number of weapons has also been dialled down. It was not that long ago that each and every character had a specific weapon complete with its own unique moveset and attack animations. We’re talking dozens of weapons, with myriad flavours of different swords and spears as well as exotic armaments such as Zuo Ci’s deck of cards, Ling Tong’s nunchucks, and Zhang He’s claws. Omega Force has opted for quality over quantity in Dynasty Warriors: Origins, giving each weapon class its own distinguishable depth and “feel”. Where the Sword and its strong attack combos should be familiar to DW fans, other weapons require a change in mindset. The Wheels, for instance, will send out a pair of arcing blades when performing a strong attack. After a couple of seconds these will return in a boomerang-like fashion, triggering an even more powerful attack with a well-timed button press.</p>
<p>While you can definitely get away with mindless button bashing on the lowest difficulty setting, Dynasty Warriors: Origins actively encourages mastery over its weapons, as well as its new combat features. Chief among these is the greatly empowered status of enemy officers. Not only do they have meatier health bars and a higher damage output, their attacks need to be countered either by dodging or parrying. Even regular soldiers pose more of a threat here, chipping away at your own health and occasionally rallying to perform unit-wide actions such as charges and arrow volleys. There’s a genuinely rewarding sense of challenge – a series’ first.</p>

<p>There’s also a surprising amount of depth. In past instalments it took maybe one or two battles to get the gist of how the entire game would play out whereas Origins continues to introduce new gameplay concepts throughout. For example, players can mix and match a growing list of Battle Arts and Tactics unlocked during the campaign alongside new mounts and items while also levelling up their weapon proficiency. Omega Force has even changed what players do off the battlefield. Instead of advancing to the next battle via a campaign menu, you are free to explore a vast world map, populated with shops, quest givers, collectables, and smaller side mission skirmishes.</p>
<p>It’s quite the visual spectacle, too. Character models may not have the uncanny lifelike detail of colossal budget AAA games, but they’re the best we’ve seen in a Musou game, some of them, including core cast members like Cao Cao and Liu Bei, ageing and changing appearance throughout the course of the campaign. Even the regular rank and file troops have received a facelift – impressive, when you consider how many of them are on-screen at any time. That said, the game’s performance remains silky smooth even during the most hectic of action set pieces.</p>

		<p>As we head into the top five of our Most Wanted games for 2025, we return to the oeuvre of Hideo Kojima with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As one of the most popular video game auteurs out there, Kojima has kept himself incredibly busy in recent years. After the success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review-ps4-pro/">Death Stranding in 2019</a>, the game gathering up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/31/game-of-the-year-2019-overall-winner/">a multitude of Game of the Year awards</a> and enjoying continued success with its PC port and eventual expanded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/23/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-is-it-an-essential-upgrade-for-ps5/">Director’s Cut</a> over the following years, a sequel was always highly likely. However, Kojima has also been working on a game titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/hideo-kojimas-xbox-exclusive-od-seems-to-be-about-scared-floating-heads/">OD for Xbox</a>, and at the start of 2024, also confirmed that he will be creating <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-action-espionage-game-after-death-stranding-2/">a new action-espionage game with Sony</a>.</p>
<p>But the plate that he and the team at Kojima Productions will stop spinning first is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach – announced in 2022 and with big gameplay reveals coming last year ahead of a 2025 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 NEW Trailer 4K (2025) PS5 Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRvuCmbrjAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While the first game was already oddly prescient, the themes running through it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">working surprisingly well in the context of the pandemic and lockdowns</a> that rolled around the world in the years following its release, Kojima threw out his narrative for Death Stranding 2 and started over to better reflect the effects of COVID-19 on the worldwide population.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2 will take place outside of North America, as Sam and the DHV Magellan look to expand the Chiral Network, doing so with the backing of a private organization known as APAC. Sam, of course, will take the lead and trudge across vast landscapes, ride on futuristic vehicles and all the rest while trying to deliver packages, through increasingly exotic and alien landscapes, and confronting all sorts of monstrosities, such as a giant inky black hand that feels like something out of a Soulslike.</p>

<p>There will be a lot of returning characters and actors for Death Stranding 2, with Norman Reedus reprising the role of Sam Bridges, and Léa Seydoux and Troy Baker reprising their roles as Fragile and Higgs. There’s also plenty of new stars joining the cast, including Elle Fanning as Tomorrow, and Shioli Kutsuna as Rainy.</p>
<p>The most recent trailer was a huge <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/29/check-out-20-minutes-from-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">20-minute video from Tokyo Game Show 2024</a>, revealing a lot about Tomorrow, who was born and grew up in the world of the dead, and Rainy, another part of the DHV Magellan crew who’s pregnant. They also have a little sing-song with Sam and Dollman (Fatih Akin), which is as bizarre and surreal as it sounds – and obviously completely in keeping with all the other craziness that has been revealed through the narrative-heavy cutscenes released so far in trailers.</p>
<p>A new photo mode will feature in Death Stranding 2 called ‘Photo Shoot Event’, which has the characters all pose and prance around for a photo shoot, playing with plushy toys of the white grubs, model some nice jackets and dance on vehicles from the game. It’s a huge shift from the typical photo mode that is found in games, with the scenes rendering and moving in real time while you snap pictures, instead of meticulously posing character models, facial expressions, lighting, and all the rest.</p>

<p>So yeah, Death Stranding 2. It looks as wild and as out of the norm as the original in every way possible, from a story that jumps down the rabbit hole, to continuing the practically unique style and tone of its gameplay, and even more of the atypical asides to enjoy in the moments between.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-revealed-coming-out-in-2025/">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is set to release for PlayStation 5 in 2025</a>.</p>
